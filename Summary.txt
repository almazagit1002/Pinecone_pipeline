Overall, the system automates the process of ingesting raw data, validating its integrity, and uploading it to a pinecone, making it suitable for data preprocessing and analysis tasks in various domains such as natural language processing, data mining, and machine learning.
Data Ingestion Stage:

Use Case: Ingesting raw data from various sources (e.g., JSON files) into the system for further processing.
Implementation: The DataIngestionPipeline class handles data ingestion tasks by retrieving configuration, parsing JSON files, processing text data, and saving processed data into CSV files.
Data Validation Stage:

Use Case: Ensuring the quality and integrity of the ingested data before further processing or analysis.
Implementation: The DataValidationPipeline class performs data validation checks such as column presence and uniqueness to validate the structure and integrity of the data.
Data Upload Stage:

Use Case: Uploading processed data to a database or indexing system for storage and retrieval.
Implementation: The DataUploadPipeline class handles data upload tasks by generating Pinecone vectors from processed data and uploading them to the Pinecone index in batches. It also provides an option to restart the database if needed.
