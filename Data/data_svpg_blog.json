And perhaps because it was so masked in my conflicts with them, I myself missed that this was the time a core part of my essential programming took shape: I always drove myself to find a better way.\nMy dad was that guy who would see cars lined up for miles approaching the exit at Disneyland and go find a different exit and ‘back way around’ that had no other cars. He was the guy who would try every door at a venue to see if one of them was accidentally left open that would allow us to slip in away from the crowds. He was never afraid to challenge the status quo and did so often.\nMaybe it was the many years of seeing him do this–and often seeing him succeed by bucking conventional thought–that embedded in me the instinct to do the same. As a pre-Google-maps teenager, this would take the shape of me trying to find new ways to get to the mall or a favorite lunch spot faster than my friends. At live rock concerts, I would command my friends as I took their hands, “Don’t let go,” and navigate us through the exiting swarm by worming into the tiniest bits of space that no one else dared try.\nBut it’s worth became really powerful when I hit the workforce. In my first internship at Kraft Europe, I was told by a coworker answering the phone that the approval for a new countertop coffee display–which required signatures from five other departments–was “in the stack, and we’ll get to it when we get to it.” I decided to walk up the two flights of stairs, stand there with the form, and see if I could get the two-minute approval. When that worked, I proceeded to do the same for each subsequent department. Apparently, no one else had thought to use the sneaker network instead of inter-office mail to reduce a multi-week process into a one-day tour. My boss was stunned–and impressed–that I’d gone from no progress to approved in a day.\nWhen I started working at Microsoft, I was the most junior product manager, which meant I got the collection of jobs no one else really wanted. In my case, that included overseeing direct mail and end-of-life-ing a soon obsolete Word for DOS. The direct mail team came to me with the last creative concept they’d used asking what I wanted to alter for the next piece. I asked, “Have we thought about interviewing customers who already upgraded to promote their reasons why in their own words?” It was a novel idea at the time. The presumption back then was those in the industry could say it better than ordinary users. “No, we haven’t done that before, but I guess we can interview a few users,” offered the direct mail lead. It resulted in a totally new direct mail piece that was the best performing Wave 4 the team had done.\nThe guy who handed Word for DOS off told me, “You’re babysitting it’s end-of-life. You shouldn’t have to touch anything.” But when I looked at it’s packaging, it was a complicated design which was expensive to produce. I met with the packaging team to see if we could simplify it, got approval, and within months had shaved over $1M in total costs from the product’s bottom line. The guy who had done the handoff asked me, “Did someone tell you to do that?” “No,” I replied, “it just seemed like the obvious thing to do.”\nIt’s only in hindsight and working with thousands of others in the interim that I realized looking for a better way isn’t obvious to many people nor is being in the habit of challenging assumptions. The world needs all types, so I have no judgment for those who don’t work this way, but I will say for those who aspire to create, regardless of background, skills, or where you apply them, this fundamental way of questioning the status quo is important for creation. And creation is what’s essential for true innovation–which is finding something that is a truly unique, novel solution. \nKnow that challenging the status quo does not mean challenging reason, facts themselves or doing so merely for the sake of being contrarian. It means taking as a given facts and constraints as they are and pushing for a better, smarter way through them.\nSo, no matter what you do, ask “Is there a better way?” and just do it! You might be surprised where it could lead you.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/a-better-way/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925846907,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"A Trend of Global Proportions - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI am writing this article sitting on yet another international flight, and I wanted to discuss what I believe to be the start of a truly transformational trend.\nI have always enjoyed working with teams internationally and especially in developing markets.  There is a newness and enthusiasm about products and technology that is contagious, and I have long believed that if you can assemble a team of smart, talented and passionate people, you can show them the techniques and methods for creating great products.\nHowever, for many years I believed that while you could supplement your workforce by outsourcing talent from other parts of the world, if you were serious about product you really needed to be in Silicon Valley.  So much of the ecosystem that we depended on was only here in Silicon Valley.\nToday I no longer believe you need to be in Silicon Valley in order to create something amazing.\nI would argue that Silicon Valley is still Mecca for technology innovation, however, the differences are much less than they used to be, and the access to local talent can even the playing field.\nFrom my vantage point, our industry has evolved over the past several years, and today we’re on the cusp of another major step.\nInitially in developing markets we would find mainly outsourcing.  Teams of developers and QA would be hired by mainly US firms to supplement their workforce.   Silicon Valley’s thirst for talent combined with our constrained geography (and hence cost of living) demanded this.\nNext, as the developing markets gained steam and moved online, and the population itself represented an interesting target market, you’d find mainly US companies going after those local markets.  They had needs and we had products.  Nothing wrong with that.\nBut it didn’t take too longer before the talent in these markets start creating their own products for their own markets.\nYou might be thinking that mostly these are just copycats of mainly US products.  Initially this was true.  Even though I’m not a fan of copycat products, it was understandable to me.  US companies often weren’t taking local needs seriously, which created the need.  Also, local teams often lacked the confidence and skills to pursue their own ideas.  It’s also true that many VC’s preferred to fund teams to do copycat products.  In any case, this was how many entrepreneurs got started.\nBy the way, copycats happen in the US at least as much as in the rest of the world, and the VC’s play a role in that here too.\nThis has all been happening for a while now, and increasingly I am seeing startups pursuing truly innovative products for their local markets.  But now I think we’re starting to see signs of the final step in this progression: startups creating innovative new products that are intended not just for their local markets, but for the world.\nWhen I meet a startup in a developing market that has done something truly innovative and valuable, which happens increasingly often on my travels, I always encourage them to think about the broader world market.  They’re often nervous and even a little intimidated, but it doesn’t take much to help them realize that their contribution is just as needed in the US and across Europe as it is in India, Brazil or China.\nOne advantage that US companies have is that since their default (and often only) language is English, and since English is an acceptable (although not usually preferred) language in a large percentage of the developed world, US companies are able to get their ideas into a broad set of markets much more easily.  And since so many sites have user generated content, that content is also then in a language that others can benefit from.\nThis is why I push on companies to make sure that they support at least English out of the gate (in addition to their native language).  It may not be fair, but it’s in their best interest.\nThere are still some obstacles to this progression reaching its potential.  Some governments make it nearly impossible for startups.  Some cultures are very risk averse.  Some investors have old biases.  But in many parts of the world, the stars have aligned and great product work and innovative startups are emerging.\nSome of my favorite product innovation hubs outside of Silicon Valley: New York, Boston, Berlin, Sao Paulo, Bangalore, and Beijing, with scattered teams almost everywhere.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/trend-global-proportions/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925854030,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"APM Programs - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThe Value of Establishing an APM Program\nI find that most tech product companies out there are struggling to find enough very strong product managers.  I have written many times in various ways about how critical it is to put very strong people in this role, and I meet execs every week that tell me that they need more.  Great products are the result of a strong product team, and the anchor of that strong product team is a very strong product manager.\nOne company that realized this a long time ago is Google.  Their first product manager, Marissa Mayer, set a very high bar, and they have worked hard over the years to recruit and develop a very strong army of product managers.  Most people know that Google has many exceptionally strong engineers, but less known is how hard they have worked to develop a set of product managers that are worthy of these engineers.\nVery early on they realized that these strong product leaders were in very short supply, and one thing they did was to establish the Associate Product Manager (APM) program.\nSometimes this name causes confusion because in many companies outside of Silicon Valley, especially companies using feature teams, the term “Associate Product Manager” refers not to this program, but rather to an entry-level, junior product manager.  As you’ll see, this program is nearly the opposite of that.\nIn the Google program, they work hard to find the absolute best and brightest, from inside the company and outside, and entry to this program gives the lucky aspiring product leader entrance into a two-year coaching program to learn how to become an exceptional product manager and likely future product leader.\nThe purpose of the program is to take high-performing and/or high-potential individuals with a proven or growing track record in other areas (be that business or education) and coach them into very strong product managers.\nMarissa gets most of the credit for this program, and put countless hours into coaching these promising product leaders, and the program has produced some exceptional talent.  Many of these people are behind Google’s best products and services, and others have moved on to lead their own companies.\nIn the same spirit, I’m most proud of the product people that I recruited and coached over the years, and I love that they are now all across our industry and leading many of the best product organizations in the world.  I was taught that as a people manager and leader, our most critical job is to develop our people.\nAll of this is a long way of saying that the real purpose of this note is to encourage the executive teams of product companies to establish their own APM program for future product leaders.\nToday, many of the top tech companies have APM programs, as the concept has spread far beyond Google to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Salesforce.com, Atlassian, and more.  Some start the program each year with a new cohort of APM’s.  Others structure the program around a rotation so the APM can get exposed to multiple types of products.  There’s no single way to set up these programs, but there are some principles I’d like to share:\nFirst, set a very high bar for acceptance into this program.  Only accept people that are recognized as among your best minds and highest potential.  The type of person that brings value to every conversation.  The type of person that is driven to make things happen and get results.\nSecond, for everyone in this program, do a thorough assessment to identify the necessary areas of skills development.  Update this assessment throughout the year.\nThird, put an individualized coaching plan in place to help these people reach their potential.  This should include ongoing mentoring from at least one of your senior executives (such as your CEO or VP Product).\nOf course the main way we learn how to create great products is by jumping in and defining, designing and building products, so be sure to put these people right in the thick of it as product manager of a key product team.\nThere are dimensions to this program that you will want to set up in a way that is consistent with your company’s culture and values, such as how visible and widely promoted the program is, and the expectations you set with the members.  I generally prefer to keep things low key.  Let the people earn the respect of their peers.  Keep this about merit and not politics.\nThe key is to realize that every tech product company needs strong product people, and the leaders of the company must constantly seek them out and work hard to develop our most promising people to reach their full potential.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/apm-programs/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925850198,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Advocating For Racial Equity - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tFor those that haven’t yet met Christian, he joined as an SVPG Partner about a year ago.  He is one of the most effective and inspiring product leaders I have ever met, but even more than that, he’s one of the most exceptional human beings I know.  So many friends at tech companies around the world have been asking what they can do to help correct the injustices in our country.  Christian has been getting this question from leaders he coaches and advises, and he agreed to let us share his suggestions more broadly.  My sincere hope is that this article makes it to the leadership team of every tech company and inspires the dialog that can lead to real change.\nWhat Can We Do: The Tech Company’s Guide to Advocating for Racial Equity\nBy SVPG Partner Christian Idiodi\nThe past few weeks have been tough for me as a black man in America. In the morning, I take calls and respond to emails as I work with and coach tech companies. At lunch, I help my teenage son respond to questions and comments from his white friends. After dinner, I spend time helping my youngest children understand why the police killed a black man, why people are protesting, and how people can feel angry, afraid, and helpless at the same time. Yet this all pales in comparison to the pain and hurt facing the black community. \nAll my life, I have looked to technology to solve meaningful problems. In many cases, I am amazed at seeing how fearless many of the tech giants have been in approaching some of the hardest problems in the world. Google is trying to stop aging and death. Elon Musk is trying to colonize Mars. So what is it about the problems of racism and racial injustice that are so daunting? Are these not problems worth solving? Do tech companies not feel an obligation to participate in solving them? Or like many organizations, have tech companies become complacent in a system that unintentionally enables racial injustice and systemic oppression? \nMy ten-year-old son loves technology. He wants to be an engineer and invent the first flying car. But my son now believes it is more likely for him to become President than to build technology that changes the world. He has seen a black President but has not seen leaders who look like him in technology. There is not a black Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Elon Musk, he says. It’s hard for him to fathom how people who don’t look like him could talk about, care about, empathize with, and more importantly, really try to solve these problems. As the ever optimist, I told him I truly believe there is so much the tech community can do to support the black community. \nSo what can tech companies do to support the black community and advocate for racial equity?\n Don’t look for permission to solve the problem. Problems worth solving are simply that — worth solving. You have never let a lack of congruence, expertise, or experience stop you from taking on some of the hardest problems in the world. Hire the smartest people, bring together the best thought leaders, and facilitate the right collaborative environment to tackle some of these issues. \n Find your voice. You don’t know what to say. That’s okay. You don’t know how to say it. That’s okay too. But let us know that you see us, you see our pain, and you want something to change. You don’t need permission to use your platform to stop hate and call out injustice. \n Be specific. Embrace your freedom to be specific in this particular cultural moment. There’s no point in saying something if you’re talking about everything. It is absolutely okay to speak specifically about issues black people are facing right now. It is absolutely okay to say “Black Lives Matter.” If you break your finger, you don’t go to the doctor about a body ache. Yes, your whole body matters, but the pain is in your finger is what needs to be addressed now. \n Overcome the imposter syndrome. Many companies feel like they understand the problem very well and at the same time, feel they do not have the credibility to take action. You don’t need a black person on your team to commit your time and resources to educate yourself or your organization. You don’t need to be a thought leader to show up in a way that is meaningful. But you do have to show up.\n Have a conversation. Set aside time as a team or organization to dialogue about race, diversity, and justice. Talk to your black colleagues, teammates, and employees. Acknowledge their need for and your responsibility to provide physical and psychological safety for all employees. Give them a platform to contribute to conversations and share their unique experiences. Let them know you see the color of their skin and you value them.\n Interview someone who does not look like you. If you are not deliberate about interviewing someone who looks different, you are not trying hard enough. Look for bias and pay inequality in your system. Black people in technology will only become the norm when giving black people opportunities to work in technology becomes the status quo.\n Consider your influence. Take inventory of the power of your platform and how it can be used to address racial injustice. Consider how much influence you have and dream about what it would look like if your product amplified the voices and actions of those fighting to break down the barriers of systemic racism. \n State your commitment to the problem. Share the internal solutions that are already being generated and advocated for. Are you using your employee resource groups? How are they being supported and how can you amplify what they are trying to achieve. Technology companies may already have people working internally to solve challenges related to race and equality. These people are already invested in your company. Take action that shows you are invested in their objectives.\n Empower black youth in technology. Find and invest in STEM programs in local black communities. The generational disenfranchisement of black youth has created barriers to them realizing the same opportunities as their white peers. Be intentional about going out to invest in the next generation of black technologists, engineers, and thought leaders. We are raising the next generation of tech leaders. \nIt is naïve to think that the world has any chance of accelerating its path out of these issues without technology. It has been the single biggest driver of growth and development in the 21st century. Consider the fact that if the murders of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery had happened 15-20 years ago, the majority of us would have never known they happened. Racial injustice has always existed, but technology has given us the ability to capture it in real-time, empathize, have conversations, and work together to take meaningful action. It gives companies the reach and power to create dialogue and connect communities. There’s always a cost to resisting the status quo. Be brave enough to recognize that no matter the dent in the world you are trying to make, issues of racism, hatred, and injustice have and will continue to derail you from your mission.\nThe SVPG Partners, January, 2020\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/advocating-for-racial-equity/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925834490,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Agile Development Processes - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tMany product development organizations have been experimenting with what has become known as “Agile Software Development” methods, the most popular of which at the time of this writing is known as “Extreme Programming” (XP) but there are several others including Scrum and Kanban.\nIn these cases, the product teams often wonder how the role of the product manager fits into the methodology. Or, the product manager may be concerned that if their product development organization uses this method then the resulting product will suffer due to some of the more publicized criticisms of the methods.\nIn this note we’ll first explain what the core tenets of Agile Development are, and then we’ll look at the specific example of XP, and then we’ll look at how this model impacts the product manager and how to deal with some of the challenges it poses.\nOverview of Agile Development Methods\nThere are twelve core principles that the various Agile methods all have in common. The ways in which each method carries out the principles vary sometimes considerably, but the common philosophy is:\n1. The top priority is to satisfy the customer through early and frequent delivery of valuable software – valuable software early\n2. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months – frequent releases\n3. Working software is the primary measure of progress – software matters more than documents\n4. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development – listen and learn rapidly\n5. Business people and developers work together daily through the project – intense collaboration\n6. Build projects around motivated individuals – give them the environment and support they need and trust them to do their job\n7. The most efficient and effective method of conveying info to and within a development team is through face-to-face conversation\n8. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams – agile architectures; good ideas from anywhere\n9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility – refactor frequently\n10. Agile processes promote sustainable development – should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely – no death marches\n11. Simplicity is essential – less is more\n12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and then adjusts its processes accordingly – post-mortems\nOverview of Extreme Programming\nTo help illustrate what it really means to follow an Agile method, let’s look at the specifics of the most popular one, known as Extreme Programming (XP). While the creators emphasized that it is not a one-size-fits-all method, and that it should be applied selectively, there are a core set of fundamental principles that form the basis of the method:\n– Pair Programming – the software is written by two programmers working together around a single computer.\n– Simple Design – the idea is to design and build only what you need right now and not for some potential future need.\n– On-site Customer – the developers have a customer that represents what the product needs to do, sitting with the team and constantly available for clarification and decisions.\n– Incremental Development – the strategy is to start small and do many “mini-releases” to rapidly evolve the product to where it needs to be.\n– Scheduling and Planning – estimates are provided by the engineers and the customer decides scope and timing for each release.\n– Continuous Code Review – based on the pair programming model, the developers are constantly reviewing each others’ work.\n– Continuous Testing – the technique is to have the developers write unit tests as they code, and the customer writes functional tests as use cases are defined, and these tests all are run on an automated, ongoing basis.\n– Continuous Build – the software is constantly built and integrated so that problems are found early and the system is always kept in a buildable state.\n– Continuous Refactoring – the software developers continually work to simplify and improve the implementation by refactoring the code, while keeping all the tests running.\n– Collective Code Ownership – rather than the model where each developer “owns” his own section of code, in the XP model every developer can improve any code anywhere in the system anytime he sees an opportunity and need.\n– Open Workspace – the idea is that the team works together in a large room with the developers in the center.\n– 40-hour Weeks – the belief is that overtime should be limited so that quality remains high.\n– Documentation via Code – the belief is that the most useful documentation is the software itself, and that the team needs to follow coding standards.\nCertainly this is very much a software developer-centric view of the world, as there really isn’t much besides the programmers (figuratively and literally at the center) and the user (the customer). However, in general, many of these techniques represent industry best practices and pose little concern to the product manager.\nThat said, there are generally three main areas of concern for the product manager:\nDiscovering the Product:\nThe first has to do with how you figure out what to build. The XP method was originally created for custom software projects to meet a single customer’s specific needs (such as an internal employee payroll system), rather than general purpose products intended for many customers representing a range of needs. In fact, in the books and articles describing the XP method, you will find barely a mention of product management (by any of its many names) or even Product Design.\nTypically the main concern is this notion of an on-site customer. However, the product manager, to the degree she has studied the target customer and understands his needs, environment and concerns, as well as the competitive situation, can do her best to serve as a proxy for the customer in this process, just as is typically done by the product manager in conventional methods.\nA larger concern is the lack of product designer role. For products that must be sold on their merits (versus custom software developed under contract), the user experience is critical, and requires the skills of professional designers, so it is important that you incorporate this key role into the process.\nThese changes can fit into the XP process by treating the first iterations as an evolving prototype, doing validation to ensure the team will be building the right product, and then proceeding to use the following iterations to develop the product implementation.\nThe key is to ensure you are building a product that customers will want to buy, and will be able to figure out how to use. It is not enough that one customer or the product manager understand it. The product must be validated with the broader representation of the target market.\nBuilding the Product\nThe second area of concern is with the consequences of some of these techniques for a scalable, high-performance, reliable, and maintainable product. These concerns quickly get into near-religious arguments about the best way to develop and test software, which are largely beyond the scope of the product management role, but the main point relative to the product manager is to ensure the release requirements are clearly defined up front. The engineering organization can then address the concerns of how to manage the risks in the best way they see fit.\nThe XP process typically looks to the customer to define the use cases (called stories) which serve as the basis for functional tests. On small efforts this may be fine, but for larger, general product efforts, there is a need for a dedicated role to concentrate on identifying and creating the necessary test cases to ensure scalability, functionality, performance, fault-tolerance, localizability, etc. This is typically the QA function, and there is no reason it can’t be used with the XP model. The key is that the developers are responsible for the unit tests, and the QA people are responsible for the other types of tests (e.g. system, integration, functional tests).\nDeploying the Product\nThe final area of concern has to do with deploying the product into production. XP challenges the long-held belief that the cost of change grows dramatically over time. In other words, by following the practices of XP, you can reduce the impact of change once a system is in production. While in general this can be true for custom internal systems, for many types of commercial software products, the impact of change remains as high, if not higher, than ever, especially with Internet services with large, active user communities.\nFortunately, we have discussed elsewhere the need for Gentle Deployment practices, and these techniques can help the product team lessen the negative impact of the more frequent releases and updates that XP projects encourage.\nSummary\nAgile Development in general, and the Extreme Programming method in particular, were created to address some truly important problems with the conventional methods of producing software, especially around increasing client/customer communication, reducing the time it takes to figure out if what you are building is something the customer will value, and reducing risk through incremental development and building out the highest priority features first. There are several very valuable techniques, especially around pair programming, incremental development, and continuous and automated test and build.\nHowever, for product organizations building commercially available products and services, it is important to augment these methods with product management, product design, and quality assurance to ensure you’re building a product that will be useful to, and usable by, a broad range of users and customers, and that will be robust enough to operate in a range of customer environments.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/agile-development-processes/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925793934,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Alternatives To Product Leaders - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThis is the second of two related articles talking about the alternatives to product managers and product leaders.  In the first article, I discussed how the product manager’s responsibilities of value and viability can, under the right conditions, be covered by other approaches.\nIn this article, I wanted to talk about alternatives to covering the product leader’s responsibilities.  \nThis one is a little more complicated because the product leaders have a pretty wide range of responsibilities, and those responsibilities normally vary depending on whether the product leader is a manager of individual contributors, or if they are a manager of managers.\nBut first, if we’re going to talk about the alternative to product leaders, we need to get on the same page as to what capable product leaders are actually responsible for.  \nAs with the product manager role, the job of the product leaders is dramatically different if the company has feature teams versus empowered product teams.  \nThe article Product Leadership Is Hard summarizes the many responsibilities of a strong product leader operating in the product model, and tries to explain why the job is a tough one to do well.  \nTo be clear, this article is all about potential alternatives to the role played by product leaders in the product model.  Most companies that don’t have capable product leaders are not operating in the product model – most have stakeholder-driven feature teams.\nThe first thing you’ll notice is that companies that have strong true product managers also have strong product leaders.  In nearly every case, it is the strong product leaders that are the ones that coach and develop the strong product managers.  \nBut the reverse is unfortunately also true.  If the company has weak product managers, it’s almost always a direct result of having weak product leaders.\nSo especially when you have weak product managers and weak product leaders, it’s not unusual for the company to look to alternatives.\nProduct Leadership at Early Stage Companies\nThis topic is one where there are very different considerations for smaller companies – especially startups and scaleups – as compared to large companies.\nIn smaller companies, it is very common that one of the cofounders (often the CEO or CTO) can be that effective product leader.  In most cases, this is a very good thing. That founder has been engaged with the product from day 1, and has participated directly in virtually everything that has been learned about the product and the customers.\nIn fact, one of the common problems is when a founder brings in a product leader prematurely, and that person simply does not have the product or customer knowledge that the founder has, and so does not have the trust of the founder or the other leaders and stakeholders.\nProduct Leadership at Scale\nBut at a certain point, the founder acting as head of product simply ceases to scale.  Especially when that founder has never done this before, and doesn’t understand the level of investment they need to make in order to develop a product leadership team under them.\nThis is the situation I’m discussing in this article.  This is when the founder / head of product has realized that she now needs real product leadership.  The founder might still keep responsibility for the product vision (I like when they do), but where they realize they need people that can build the necessary product teams, come up with the necessary product strategy, and ensure the organization is able to execute on that product vision and strategy.\nAlternatives to Product Leadership\nI want to be clear up front: I’m sharing below the main approaches I’ve seen attempted, but the truth is, for a company at scale, I don’t know of any real alternative to strong product leaders, because I haven’t seen any of these alternatives consistently work, in terms of generating the necessary business outcomes.  \nLeading With Command and Control\nThe main alternative to strong product leadership is when that founder is not willing or able to invest in developing one or more strong product leaders, and truly empower those people, she reverts to command and control style leadership.\nThe most common version of this is that the founder delegates to one or more business leaders, and each of these stakeholders takes responsibility for driving product for their area.  Hence the so-called “peanut-butter” product strategy, stakeholder-driven roadmaps, and the feature teams that support them.\nHowever, sometimes the founder / CEO tries to continue to play the role of product leader herself, and then you’ll see a large, consolidated product roadmap, and the many feature teams that support them.\nIn either case, soon enough, the company finds itself dealing with the consequences of feature teams:  The teams are not empowered; they are mercenaries, there to serve the business by delivering the projects and features the CEO or stakeholders request.  The focus is now on output, and not outcomes. Tech debt issues accelerate as a consequence of the project focus.  Product managers become project managers. Design is run like an internal agency.  Innovation rarely happens because the engineers are simply there to code.  The best people usually start to leave.\nWhen I said earlier that strong product managers are almost always found in companies with strong product leaders, it is because this is the key to empowerment.  I often explain to companies that empowered product teams don’t require less management, they require better management.  As I’ve written many times, empowerment does not mean just giving those people space to work.\nIn order to truly empower people, you have to have both the experience to effectively coach, and also be immersed in the strategy and execution to help the product teams make good decisions and achieve successful outcomes.\nLeading With Process\nThe second alternative to product leadership is something I’ve also written a great deal about already, and that’s when weak product leaders try to lead through process.  I don’t want to repeat all the arguments again, especially since so many people have already heard my rantings against process people destroying product organizations.  Let me just emphasize that there’s a reason the leaders of the top product companies are so scared of this disease infecting their companies.\nLeading With Proxies\nThe third alternative to product leadership is when companies try to create a separate group that attempts to cover at least some of the product leadership responsibilities – especially product strategy, and improving the effectiveness of the product managers –  but almost always with people that are considerably less experienced than true product leaders.  All too often these people then fall back on “process and governance,” which comes with the problems I’ve already discussed.\nLeading With Product Leadership\nSo we’re back to the need for true product leadership.\nProduct companies survive and thrive when they provide successful products and services to their customers.  I’m not sure why so many companies resist the concept that a strong product company requires strong product leadership.  I literally can’t think of a more essential competency for a product company.\nIf you’re a product company, especially a tech-powered product company, I argue this is the single most important thing for you to get right.  Everything else, including marketing, sales, revenue, profit, and valuation, all directly or indirectly derive from this.\nIf you’re a startup, the goal is product/market fit.  If you’re a more established company, then your goal is consistent innovation creating value for your customers and your company.  The key in both cases is strong product leadership.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/alternatives-to-product-leaders/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925795616,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Alternatives To Product Managers - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nI doubt anyone is surprised to learn that many people have been asking me about Brian Chesky’s recent comments.\nI’ve been hesitant to write about this topic for two reasons:  First, I didn’t want to provide oxygen to this topic, as I consider this interview one that creates as many questions as it answers.  Second, I like to write about topics that I think will endure, and are not just a response to temporary interest from a single leader making a provocative statement.\nThat said, there’s little doubt that many leaders are frustrated with their product managers, and while I’ve warned about that before, this interview gets many of these issues out on the table.  There are also some important lessons about the journey of a leader as they move towards the product model.\nSo my intention here is to write a series of two articles, this one on the alternatives to product managers, and the next on the alternatives to product leaders.  With those two articles as context, I think most people will be able to predict how I would respond to the various specific issues raised in the interview.\nBefore we dive in, there are two important points to remind people of:\nFirst, if you have not yet read the article on Product Teams vs Feature Teams, then I’d strongly suggest you pause here and read that carefully, as those concepts underlie much of the discussion that follows.\nSecond, keep in mind that my work is all about sharing the practices that try to give you the best chance of product success.  I always try to explain that there is no one right way.  In fact, for early stage startups, I’ve long argued that what matters most are the specific individuals involved.  They matter more than whether the people are co-located or remote, or what particular roles and responsibilities each person has, or the product vision, or the techniques they use to discover and deliver their product.  But as companies grow, they usually find that they start to run up against the limitations of what these individuals can personally do, so then they’re looking to find a more scalable and repeatable approach.  And that’s what my work tries to focus on.\nAlternatives to Product Managers\nNote that the wording here is intentional.  If you define product management, as I do, as being responsible for the value and viability of what gets built, then there really isn’t an alternative to product management – someone is doing this one way or another. \nHowever, product managers have never been the only way to cover the product management responsibilities, and there are definitely alternatives, some much better than others.\nI have long warned that if you have feature teams, then eventually the company’s leaders (if they’re paying attention) come to realize that the people titled product managers are really project managers (aka program managers or delivery managers).  \nOr even worse, if you have Agile-trained product owners in the seats where you need product managers, then what you really have are backlog administrators, which leaders eventually come to realize provides very little value to anyone.\nBut the real point here is that neither the feature team product manager, nor the Agile product owner, are providing the necessary product management, so something else must be going on, and that’s what we’ll discuss here.\nFounder or Stakeholder-Driven Product Management\nThe most common alternative to product managers is that the founder/CEO (in a small company), or the stakeholders (in a medium or large company), are taking responsibility for the product management (the value and viability of what is to be built), and the product teams are just there to build out the roadmap features and projects (i.e. they are feature teams).\nAnother common manifestation of essentially the same dynamic is that there are business owners that cover the product management, and the product owners just cover the backlog management (serving as the interface to the engineers).  \nThis alternative model has been around forever, and the limitations are well known (see Product Fail).  It’s no secret that I’m no fan of this alternative to product managers, and consider it the root cause of most failed efforts.\nAnother Product Team Member Steps Up \nThere have always been examples where either the designer or one of the engineers steps up and covers the product management responsibilities.  No real reason it couldn’t be another team member, but it’s usually the designer or the tech lead.\nTo be clear, I don’t mean covering the product owner role, which is not hard for someone else on the team to do.  I mean doing the work to learn the customer dynamics, the product data, the competitive landscape, and the many business viability constraints in order to cover value and viability.\nI admit to having a real appreciation for the ambitious people that put in the work to tackle this dual role (and especially those rare few that learn the skills to tackle all three – product, design and engineering, known with real admiration as “triple threats”), but this has never been a scalable or sustainable solution because it requires the person taking on essentially two full-time jobs at once. \nProduct Leader-Driven Product Management\nHowever, there is another alternative that I think in the right context can be extremely effective: this is when the product management responsibility is covered by skilled product leaders.  The most famous example of this working at scale is Apple.\nThe most important thing to understand about Apple is that they have three very different types of products.  They have a small number of consumer devices that dominate their business and product strategy; they have a few major operating systems that power their devices; and they have a large number of more conventional consumer services and applications.\nConsider for a moment just how different each of these three are from the others.  I’ll save a deeper dive on the differences between the three for a future article, but for now, we need to talk about their alternative to product managers.\nIf you talk to people working at Apple, most of them will tell you, usually with thinly disguised pride, that while they have world-class designers and world-class engineers, and they have strong program managers supporting these people, they don’t have product managers.\nThey do have product marketing managers, but while these people do help significantly on go-to-market, they are not really covering the core of product management – value and viability – and they are not the basis of their alternative to product managers.\nAt Apple, the people covering the true product management responsibilities, and in my personal opinion the most under-appreciated aspect of Apple’s version of the product model, is that they have a remarkable number of the best product leaders I’ve ever seen.\nTheir product leaders are exceptionally strong, deeply knowledgeable, true product people in the best sense of the term, deeply engaged with the product teams on value and viability, as well as product vision, product strategy, team topology, all on top of being responsible for coaching and developing the talent on their teams.\nThis alternative approach does mean that these product leaders can be bottlenecks on decisions, and it’s not a coincidence that Apple is not known for moving quickly.  \nBut if you consider consumer devices, where the outcome depends so heavily on many different product teams contributing to a seamless whole, then this model has very real advantages.\nWhile this alternative works quite well for consumer devices (a small number of very complex products), there are some real challenges when it comes to the large number of diverse services and applications, and this is where you’ll find more examples at Apple of strong individual contributor product managers collaborating directly with product designers and engineers.\nShould You Consider An Alternative To Product Managers?\nIf you’re a CEO or GM, you might be thinking that instead of trying to recruit and develop strong, true product managers, maybe you’ll just do like Apple and skip the product managers, and you’ll just take responsibility for value and viability yourself?  \nIf so, it’s critical to understand that the Apple product model depends on exceptionally strong product leaders.  Many of Apple’s product leaders have 10-25 years of experience building world-class products at Apple.  \nJust like countless CEO’s fancied themselves to be the next Steve Jobs, only to find out they weren’t even close, unless you have truly strong product leaders, don’t expect the same results.\nI certainly believe that true product managers (not feature-team product managers or product owners) are the most scalable and sustainable solution to driving consistent innovation on behalf of our customers. However, it’s important to realize that you don’t need to have product managers to cover the product management responsibilities.  The responsibilities of value and viability don’t go away, but they can be covered by other qualified people, such as strong product leaders.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/alternatives-to-product-managers/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925849884,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"An Open Letter To The Design Community - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI hope that everyone that reads this knows that I am one of the biggest advocates in our industry for user experience.  Because I generally work with the CEO’s, VP Product, and product managers of technology companies, I am probably in the best position to explain to them the importance of user experience design in coming up with great products.  I am not a designer, and I don’t have a design agency I’m trying to sell, so they know I have no personal interest other than I just want them to create better products.\nOver the past several years I’ve put together a pretty strong business case for user experience (UX), and one consequence of working with me is that most of the time the companies immediately try to embrace the role of UX.   The companies I’ve worked with have opened hundreds of jobs, I’ve personally helped place dozens of designers, and I constantly advocate for the inclusion of design in the process of product creation.\nThat said, I could use a little help.\nWhen these companies hire designers, most of the time the results are immediate and unmistakable.  But sometimes there are bumps in the road to better products, and often these bumps are caused by designers either inadvertently or mistakenly falling into some common traps.\nHere are the major areas where I often see problems:\nKnow Your Audience(s) – As designers, you basically have three key audiences.  Your colleagues in design and product management; the users you’re designing for; and the execs and other key stakeholders.  Please understand that these are three very different audiences, especially your execs.  To be specific, don’t try to show taxonomies, concept maps, site maps, task analysis grids, design process maps and even wireframes to execs.  These tools are all useful for designers, but not for execs.  Please trust me when I say they will only serve to freak out the execs.  They might humor you and try to look impressed, but then they call me and complain that they have no idea what you said, what the heck you are doing, and now they’re really nervous, and I have to talk them off the cliff.  Please people, if you want to succeed at your company, just remember this rule: the only thing that works to explain your design to execs and stakeholders are prototypes, the higher the fidelity the better.  Do yourself a favor and keep the sausage making within the design team.  Some execs will want to know how you got from here to there, and that’s okay, so long as you start with them understanding where “there” is.  Note that this doesn’t mean that you can go dark on your execs for extended periods of time.\nBe Sensitive To Change – when your company does finally decide that user experience is important, please don’t come back and propose to your management a three to six month design phase of contextual inquiries/ethnographic research, persona development, concept mapping, undirected user testing, heuristic reviews, and competitive analysis, etc, all before you can get to something they can understand.  Now, I happen to be fans of each of these techniques, but you need to be smart about how you introduce these techniques to the process and the organization.  The key is to separate out the baseline customer learning activities (which should be ongoing and in the background), from the project specific work.  And with customer learning, when introducing this into the organization, look for some quick wins, and always share generously what you’re learning about your customers.\nIt’s About Customer Learning – people tend to think of UX as usability, but usability is typically the easy part, and, for example, calling it “usability testing” understates the importance and role.  You’re responsible for much more.  In general, you want to position “User Research” and the UX team in general as the resources that enable rapid and continuous customer learning.  You’ve got several tools to learn about customers, some qualitative, some quantitative, some based on prototypes and user testing, some based on split testing and analytics.  But it’s all about facilitating rapid and continuous customer learning.\nTime To Step Up – the design community has long argued (rightfully) that you need to be included from day 1, but this means that your job is not simply to design pages based on what comes down from the Product Manager in the form of “the requirements.”  It’s your responsibility to help figure out what the product needs to be, and this means the requirements.  If you tell the product manager to come back once he makes up his mind, you are severely limiting your ability to contribute, and very likely condemning the product to mediocrity from the start.   The product manager is ultimately responsible for the decisions as to functionality, but you need to help the product manager identify what’s really required and what’s not.  This problem is especially common when the designer comes from either a very waterfall process background, or an agency that is used to doing work based on contracts and not starting anything until the requirements or at least a creative brief is defined.\nRole Confusion – at many companies, when I first start working with the execs, they don’t understand the difference between the types of designers.  Often, they just have one person (usually a visual designer) in the role and they complain to me about the effectiveness of the design.  I find it important to explain to the execs the difference between interaction design, visual design, and user research.  Mostly the designers at the company are grateful as they have often been arguing that the company needs to hire either an interaction designer or a visual designer, but it was falling on deaf ears.  Sometimes we need to be creative to come up with an effective mix of skill sets.  I recently visited with an interaction designer friend of mine at his startup, and he was showing me some of his work and while I knew him to be a very strong interaction designer, his visual designs were always pretty weak.  But this stuff was great work.  I asked him how that happened, and he confessed to me something interesting.  He said that he had a visual designer friend that was at another startup, and that she was in the opposite boat; she had strong visual design skills but never had any training in interaction design.  So they worked out a nice little arrangement.  He helps her with the interaction design of her projects, and she helps him with the visual design of his projects.  The result is that they are both producing much better designs for their startups.  This was possible because both of these people were honest with themselves on their skill sets, and they both appreciated what the other could contribute.  There are of course some designers that are very strong at both interaction design and visual design, and while I think this is worth striving for especially in senior designers, in my experience this is pretty rare.\nTitles – usually one of the first actions a company takes after I engage with them is to start to staff a UX capability.  So the execs start searching but they quickly get confused with the potpourri of titles.  Honestly it just makes the UX community look like it doesn’t have its act together.  From my perspective, we need to pick our battles, and this isn’t one of them.  I’ve long ago adopted Alan Cooper’s titles of “Interaction Designer,” “Visual Designer,” and “User Researcher.”  I occasionally use the title “Product Designer” for those few that really can represent the holistic design of the product – including interaction design, visual design and sometimes product management as well.  Most of the confusion is with the various predecessors and derivations of interaction designer, including old titles like “information architect,” “human factors engineer,” “UX designer,” “interface designer,” “UI designer,” “user interface architect,” and “user interface analyst.”  Same problem with “usability engineer,” “usability researcher,” or “usability designer” when talking about user researchers.  I am glad to see our industry finally standardizing on “User Experience” for the design organization as a whole.  If you’ve got one of these old titles and you want me to help you get a job, you’ll want to use switch to the standard title.  Again, I didn’t pick any of these names, and you could split hairs on any of them, but let’s please not waste our energies there.\nOn the subject of prototype testing:\n– always make sure the product manager and interaction designer is present, even if you have to drag their ass to the test.  If you’re one of the few people left that still think these people should be sheltered from the actual user you need to either get with the program, or get out of the way because you are hurting your company.  Sorry to be so harsh but this is too important.  I have seen too many product managers that read your report, and discount your findings because they assume either you are an idiot, or the people you brought in for testing are idiots (or both).  Make them watch.\n– realize that the moment of greatest learning happens after the usability testing portion of a prototype test.  At this point, the user actually understands what you’re trying to discuss with them, and you can have great dialogs.  So don’t over script this.  Allow the product manager to interact with this user and see where the conversation goes.  You just might discover a pivot that changes the course of your company.\n– an informal e-mail with key learnings and results sent the same day, is much more valuable to the team than a formal report sent a week later.  Don’t bother with formal reports – your time is too valuable for this and they’re hardly read anyway.\n– except in very rare cases, don’t propose a round of usability testing just before launch.  It’s a no-win situation as it’s too late to do anything about the problems you find.  Do your testing in the first weeks of the project, using prototypes, when the results can actually be used.  It’s okay to test again after the launch using the live product.\n– not everyone will agree with me on this, and it’s the subject of a future article, but I no longer waste time testing paper prototypes or wireframes on users.  Just as they don’t work with execs, they just aren’t very useful with users.  Push the team to get a high-fidelity prototype as fast as possible.  The tools have never been better so it’s not hard, and most importantly, that’s when the real learning begins.\nI know that for many of you I am preaching to the choir.  But if not, I hope you take these pleas to heart, as they are all meant to help you succeed at your company and enable user experience to be viewed as absolutely central to continuous customer learning and product innovation.\nA special thanks to designers Jeff Herman, Kyrie Robinson and Audrey Crane for their feedback on early versions of this article.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/an-open-letter-to-the-design-community/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925849769,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"An SVPG Process? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRecently I’ve been sharing more publicly my growing concern about product organizations’ increasing focus on heavyweight processes and process people.  \nThis isn’t a new phenomenon, but it does seem to come and go in waves over the years.\nI understand the appeal, especially in organizations struggling with scale.\nOne consequence of my efforts to shine a light on this problem is that I’m often asked something along the lines of “what about the SVPG process?” (or “the INSPIRED process” or “the EMPOWERED process”, or yikes, “the Marty Cagan process”)?\nIn this article I wanted to clarify this because I do consider it important to how good product teams think about the role of process.\nI did try to address this in an earlier article describing the difference between processes and conceptual models.  But that article is probably too wonky for people that aren’t product coaches.\nSo I want to take another pass at this.\nFirst, it’s important to acknowledge that at some level, nearly everything is a process.  \nWhen you make dinner you are following a process.  When you run a user test you’re following a process.  When you write software implementing a new feature you’re following a process.\nIn fact, in the book INSPIRED, I structure the book around four major concepts: people, product, process and culture.  But the section on process is actually a set of techniques that are helpful in specific cases, depending on the problem you’re facing at the moment.  \nAt the time I wrote the book, the term “process” didn’t have the baggage associated with it that it does now.\nSecond, it’s also important to remind everyone that the things we (SVPG) write about and advocate are not things we invented ourselves.  They are simply the practices and techniques we observe being used in the best product teams and product companies.\nIt is true that because companies often refer to their practices by different terms, and because their favorite techniques are sometimes tangled up with their unique cultures, we occasionally need to introduce a term to describe the concept in a neutral way.  \nThat’s the origin for the term “product discovery.”  But it’s similar for the terms feature teams and empowered product teams, delivery manager and a handful of others.\nThird, there are of course many different discovery processes, just as there are many different delivery processes.  Just as there are many different software engineering processes, and many different software testing processes.  \nDiscovery and delivery are just two activities going on in parallel.  Just as software engineering and software testing are two activities usually going on in parallel.\nSo hopefully it’s clear that there is no specific SVPG process.  Instead, we’re trying to convey a set of principles and a mindset for attacking tough problems, and we’re trying to share the tools and techniques that can be helpful in figuring out a good solution.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/an-svpg-process/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925852984,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Analyzing Product Strategy - Silicon

TRANSFORMED Workshop - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFor those of you that have been following along on the progress of the new book TRANSFORMED, the content is now roughly three quarters of the way there.  The remaining sections discuss how to address specific objections, and overcome inevitable obstacles.\nNext month I will be doing a special 1-day, in-person workshop with a group of 50 product and company leaders at a popular conference in Norway, and that workshop sold out in just a few weeks, so I consider that a strong demand signal.\nThe reason for this note is that I am now feeling ready to test the content with a broader set of tech and product leaders, so we are ready to announce three, one-day public workshops, one in London on July 24, one in NYC on July 26, and the other in Stockholm on Sept 4.\nThese will be in-person sessions in order to maximize the interaction.  \nFor this early group only, I will also be holding optional monthly, virtual, follow-on “transformation AMA sessions,” which will last at least 3 months, possibly more, depending on the amount of questions, which will help me gauge their progress.\nWhat is the purpose of this workshop?\nIt’s no secret that the overwhelming majority of companies globally that have attempted to transform have failed.  And rarely for lack of funding.\nMany companies think that all it takes to transform is to implement Agile.  Others think it’s all about introducing modern product management.  But readers of these articles know that transforming to the product model means much more than this.  \nAnd this degree of change is never easy.  One CEO described the experience of transforming as “changing from driving on the left side of the road to the right – but gradually.”  I laughed out loud when I heard the metaphor, because it’s pretty apt.\nYet some companies do manage to transform, and their customers, employees and shareholders have benefited dramatically from their new abilities.\nThe purpose of this workshop, and the upcoming book TRANSFORMED, is to share what we have learned over the past twenty years of helping companies transform to the product model.\nWho is this workshop for?\nThis workshop is designed for the leaders out there that are trying to help their companies transform: CEO’s, Chief Digital Officers, Chief Transformation Officers, heads of product (CPO) and heads of technology (CTO, CIO), as well as other key change agents trying to help their company succeed in this journey, such as product or transformation coaches, managers, and influential individual contributors.\nWhat specifically will be covered?\nThe purpose of the workshop is to provide a comprehensive understanding of what’s involved in a successful transformation to the product model, and the steps required to succeed.\nThis means understanding the necessary new product competencies, the necessary new product concepts, and the critical product principles that you’ll need to get right.  It also includes tackling the difficult objections, and addressing inevitable problems.  \nHere are the specific questions we’ll be covering:\nwhat is the product model, and what does it really mean to transform?\nwhat can a company do once they’ve transformed that they couldn’t do before?\nwhat are the new core competencies that the product model depends on?\nwhat are the new core concepts that the product model depends on?\nwhat are the set of product first principles that you need to get right?\nhow do we assess our organization and create a plan to transform?\nwhat are the tools and techniques for adopting and managing the required changes?\nwhat are the common objections from each key stakeholder, and how are they best addressed?\nwhat are the common problems encountered when moving to this model, and how are they best overcome?\nPlease Note: to set expectations properly, we will not be diving in and teaching how to do the various product deliverables such as the product vision, product strategy, team topology, continuous product discovery and continuous delivery, as that would take much longer.  We will be describing what each of these concepts are, who is responsible for each, and how to recognize a good result, but that’s very different from describing how to create each of these.  We do offer books and workshops for the specific topics (EMPOWERED and INSPIRED), but that is not the goal of this workshop.\nWill we learn about real examples of successful transformations?\nIn our other books and workshops we highlight examples from the top product companies in the world, but it’s also true that most of them were born into the product model.  It is much harder for companies that need to transform to the product model.  \nThis is why every example in the new book and new workshop is from companies that first needed to transform in order to innovate.  And some of the examples of what these companies have been able to do with their new skills will amaze you.\nSpecifically, the workshop will present the details of three successful transformations to the product model, all from large, established enterprise companies, as well as many examples of what transformed companies have been able to do once they’ve built these new skills.\nThe transformation case studies are intended to show you what is required to transform, that it is indeed possible to successfully move to the product model, and the discovery case studies are intended to show you what a company that has transformed is now capable of.\nWho will be leading this workshop?\nFor the past twenty years, SVPG has been helping companies around the globe to understand the product model, and develop the necessary skills and competencies to survive and thrive in markets where the enabling technology and customer expectations are changing rapidly.\nThis workshop will be led personally by Marty Cagan, the founder of the Silicon Valley Product Group, and the primary author of INSPIRED, EMPOWERED and the upcoming TRANSFORMED.\nWhat are the specifics – pricing and timing?\nThis workshop will be one full day, running from 9 am in the morning to 5:30 pm in the evening.  This is an in-person workshop, designed around tackling difficult concepts with intense interaction.\nThe price is USD $2395 per person for this workshop (early bird pricing is USD $1995).  Capacity is limited.\nWhere do I sign up?\nYou can sign up for the July 24 London session here. \nYou can sign up for the July 26 NYC session here. \nYou can sign up for the Sept 4 Stockholm session here.\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out to

Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Culture\n\tOctober 1, 2021\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tI love product origin stories.  I’ve been able to participate in a handful, and I’ve witnessed quite a few more, but I especially love learning the origin stories of different types of products well outside my own area of expertise.\nIf you’ve been following the news, you know the trial is currently underway for one of the industry’s most high-profile origin stories that went horribly wrong, which is the story of Theranos.  If you don’t know the story, I highly recommend the absolutely riveting book by John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup.  \nI read the book three years ago when the book came out, but now that the trial is underway, it’s reminding me again of just how bad a company and leader can be.\nI have zero sympathy for the investors in Theranos, but I definitely feel for so many of the employees, and especially for the patients.\nWhile the Theranos story is most definitely extreme, I do think it’s an example of an all too common problem, which is when the founders of a company prove they can sell a product concept (aka demand testing), but they too often don’t understand that demonstrating demand is the easy part.  Actually discovering and delivering a product that addresses the need is the hard part.\nI was talking with a friend the other day about Theranos, and he told me about a different medical device company, called Ventana, that tackled a very difficult problem, but actually put in the hard work to discover and deliver a real product, and the result was that they literally changed medicine and saved countless lives.\nThe founder of Ventana recently published a book called Chasing The Invisible: A Doctor’s Quest To Abolish The Last Unseen Cancer Cell.  I just finished the book, and I loved it.  Just a beautiful example of product discovery in a regulated industry by a motivated and empowered team.\nThere’s no question that health care is a challenging industry, but I have been encouraged of late to see very impressive product progress by serious product companies.  Check out Grail and Suki as just a couple examples to see what I mean.\nThere are so many lessons to be learned from the Theranos debacle, but I hope product people at least take away three things: 1) the importance of ethics in leaders; 2) demonstrating demand is the easy part, and it tells you next to nothing about the company’s ability to deliver a product; and 3) product is hard.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured

You Technical Enough? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI’ve written earlier about how much domain experience is important for product managers (The Role of Domain Experience) and also the pros and cons of college hires versus hiring experience (Youth vs. Experience), but a question I often get is just how much technological competency is required in order to be a strong, effective product manager? Many managers aren’t really sure if a candidate is technical enough, and many aspiring product managers aren’t sure if they are technical enough for the job.\nThis is an especially relevant topic right now because the current industry flagship, Google, is famous for having a very high technology bar for product managers. Google is a bit of a special case, so I’ll come back to them in a bit, but I think this is not only a fair question, it’s critically important question.\nFirst a necessary disclaimer. I think you’ll find the opinions on this topic vary based on whether the person has a technical background or not. A political science undergrad from Stanford that goes on to get a Harvard MBA and move into product management may have one view, versus the computer science student turned software engineer that then moved into product management. My education was in computer science, and my career began with 10 years in software development, most of it at HP Labs, which was an extremely engineering and technology-driven culture. So there’s little question that my opinion carries some biases based on that path. That said, I think some of what you see below may surprise you.\nWhy Technology Competency Is Critically Important\nThere are two very big reasons why I believe that technology competency is absolutely critical to being an effective product manager.\nFirst, I have long argued that great products result when you combine a real need or problem with something that is just now possible. The technology competency is what allows you to understand and identify what’s just now possible and how it can solve your problem in a new or better way. I argue that this ability to quickly grok and apply new technologies to solve problems is at the core of great products and great product management.\nSecond, while I believe it is absolutely true that it doesn’t matter how great your engineering team is if the product manager doesn’t provide them something useful to build, it’s equally true that without the engineering team to build the product, you have nothing. So you absolutely must work effectively with your engineering team. You have to be able to speak their language, understand and appreciate their issues, gain their respect, and be a capable partner in the collaboration that’s necessary for any product.\nWhen I interview product management candidates, I’m looking hard at these two points. The candidate must convince me that they are capable of understanding and applying new technology, and of earning the respect of the engineering team.\nThat said…\nWhy Technology Competency is Often Overrated\nWhile I believe in every word above, I also think that in general the technology competency requirement is often overrated, again for two big reasons.\nFirst, for most products, it’s all about the user experience. It’s really not about the technology used to build or scale the product, it’s about providing a user experience that users want to use, and can figure out how to use. This speaks to a design competency more than a technology competency. The most excellent book, “The Inmates Are Running The Asylum” by Alan Cooper makes this point better than I can. Having a product manager that’s a great potential contributor on systems architecture, but whose eyes glaze over when the discussion turns to information architecture is not useful.\nSecond, one thing I absolutely love about the Internet era is that for a great many types of products and services, we are typically limited more by our imagination than our technology. As an example, when I lead the product team at eBay, there were hundreds of projects during my time, but only rarely did the engineering team tell us that we couldn’t build what we wanted to. Now partly this was because there were quite a few exceptionally good engineers and architects, but I’ve seen this in many companies since. The true bottleneck in most companies is not the engineers or the technology, but rather it’s the ability of the product managers and designers to come up with something worthwhile and compelling.\nWhat Is Technology Competency?\nI realize I’ve been using this term loosely. There’s lots of “technology” that an engineering team deals with and you learn when you spend time as a developer. There’s technology topics like programming languages. Does the product manager need to understand the pros and cons of multiple inheritance or polymorphism? Probably not.\nThere’s technology topics having to do with team development, conflict management, and continuous and reproducible builds. Does the product manager need to understand the various forms of parallel development and the difference between configuration management and version control? Probably not.\nHowever, when the engineering team has been unable to invest in infrastructure and the team is facing real issues in terms of scalability, availability, and maintainability, does the product need to understand and appreciate these issues and their impact on the ability to get new features delivered? Definitely yes.\nAnd when a new technology is introduced, such as Ajax, or Silverlight, or Android, or the Facebook platform, does the product manager need to quickly understand what these technologies enable, and then come up with ways for these technologies to benefit their customers? Absolutely.\nTechnology Competency is when the product manager can quickly learn new and relevant technologies, not necessarily in order to code to them, but to apply them. Strengths and weaknesses, capabilities and limitations.\nHow do you develop your technology competency?\nJust as I am constantly exhorting product managers to get out there and talk face to face with users and customers, you should also spend considerable time developing your technical competencies. There are many ways to do this. Books, articles, blogs, extension courses, experiment with the technologies or write software on your own, spend more time with your engineers, ask them about the technology topics they are exploring and tag along. Just like spending face time with users, spending time with your engineers on the technology is an ongoing responsibility. Remember that what is possible is constantly changing, literally every day in our business, so you must be passionate about pursuing this knowledge.\nSome Exceptions to the Rule\nSo hopefully you can see that while I consider technology competency an essential requirement, I also view it as something that most people in high-tech can absolutely achieve with a some effort. All that said, there are a couple important exceptions to this.\nThe first exception is with certain type of products that truly do require a level of technical sophistication in order to competently define useful products. A very important and timely example of this is platform product management. Here you not only work with developers to build your product, but you also work with developers as customers and users, and typically at the level of the software itself. There are other products like this – developer tools and technologies, system infrastructure, systems software, etc.\nThe second important exception has to do not with the type of product, but with the culture of the company. There are a few companies that have established engineering as the basis of their culture and DNA. Today the main example of this is Google. Before that it was Microsoft. And before that it was HP. So these companies may set a bar for product managers that isn’t necessarily due to the job requirements, but more due to the cultural requirements, in order to gain the team’s respect, and work effectively with others in the company, including and especially the company executives.\nSo if your objective is to be a product manager at somewhere like Google, and you don’t have deep first-hand technology experience already, my suggestion is to get a job as a developer and spend a couple years immersing yourself in that world. It won’t necessarily make a big difference in your ability to define great products, but it can make a very big difference in your ability to get accepted into the culture and work effectively with the rest of the product team.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/are-you-technical-enough/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925795516,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Article: Product Risk Taxonomy","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nOne of the questions I get quite frequently has to do with the different risk taxonomies for product teams that are out there, and if I have strong opinions of one over another?\nMy immediate response to people is that I am very happy if they are using any of the popular risk taxonomies. The truth is, most are not, especially in feature teams. And there’s a straight line between not using one of the risk taxonomies, and failed product efforts. Especially failed MVPs.\nWhat is a Risk Taxonomy?\nA risk taxonomy is a classification system designed to categorize different types of risks within an organization that should be considered by all members of a team. The process of managing and analyzing risks is made much simpler with the help of breaking them down into specific categories. As a result, organizations can have a better understanding of their risk landscape and make better informed decisions on risk management strategies.\nBreakdown of Various Risk Taxonomies\nThere are three popular product risk taxonomies that I am aware of.\nThe first is the one I was originally taught, and is the one I described in the first edition of INSPIRED (from 2008): value, usability and feasibility.  I used this for well over a decade, and I like that it’s just 3 risks, and it’s fairly intuitive for people to grasp.  \nHowever, over time I began to see a recurring and serious problem with this taxonomy.  “Value” was supposed to cover both customer value and business value.  But I kept encountering the problem where the product team would focus on customer value, but would gloss over business value.  In fact, even today you can find far too many product people, even some that are considered thought leaders, that argue that “the only thing you need to focus on is coming up with a product your customers love.”  I wish.\nThis might be just a coincidence, but I suspect this problem is correlated with the rise in the anti-pattern of the product owner as product manager.  Before Agile became widespread, at least in my experience, product teams had a better understanding of the importance of solving for the business as well as for the customer.  \nTo address this, in the second edition of INSPIRED (2018), I separated out those two risks into customer value and business viability.\nI know this may sound minor to people, but for things like this, where you are trying to coach people to keep something important in their minds while they think through a problem, it really is better to have 3 items rather than 4.  But I believed at the time, and I still believe this is the case, that it’s worth the extra cognitive load to have the four risk taxonomy: value, usability, feasibility and viability.\nThe third product risk taxonomy that’s out there was created by one of my all-time favorite product design companies, IDEO, and was popularized as part of the design thinking methodology, which is why this risk taxonomy is a favorite of the design community.  In this taxonomy, there are three risks: desirability, viability and feasibility.  While viability and feasibility are the same as above, desirability combines customer value and usability.\nI like the IDEO risk taxonomy, and have seen it work well for many teams, but I have found it to be a much better fit for consumer products, than it is for business products.  \nRemember that for consumer products, the user is also the buyer.  In this case, usability and value are extremely intertwined, and for the most part, if you don’t want (desire) the product you don’t buy or use the product.\nHowever, most of you already know that it’s very different in a business context.  In this case, the user and the buyer are typically very different people, with very different concerns, motivations and needs.  More generally, in the business context, desirability is not really something that many users even consider a relevant concept.  They will often make it painfully clear that they have no desire to use this product, but they must use this product to do their job and collect a paycheck.  So they are more concerned with whether they can effectively learn and use this product (usability) to do their job.  And we look primarily to the buyer to explicitly address customer value – would they buy this product for their company?\nWith each of these three risk taxonomies, there are quite a few important risks embedded within business viability risk.  For example, business viability includes ethical risk, go-to-market risk, and compliance risk, to name a few that are especially important.  Every so often someone will write to me, making the case for breaking out one or more of these risks, again for the reason of wanting to shine a light on an important risk that is too often neglected.  I’m sympathetic to that argument, but I also know that this is a balance between a taxonomy that’s easy to remember and apply, and one that is more comprehensive and explicit, but seldom used.\nOur Recommended Risk Taxonomy\nAt SVPG, we evangelize the four-risk taxonomy of value, usability, feasibility and viability.\nBut the higher order point to remember is that any of these risk taxonomies can work, and any of them are far better than using none at all.\nAssessing the product risks is the first thing we do when we’re trying to discover a solution worth building.  Once we understand the risks, we have many different techniques for quickly testing ideas against those risks.  If you don’t know what those techniques are, that’s why I wrote INSPIRED.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-risk-taxonomies/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925830218,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Article: Product vs Feature Teams","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThis article is certain to upset many people.\nI’m sorry for that, but the degree of ongoing noise and confusion surrounding the role of product at tech companies is only getting worse.  Moreover, I see the issues and problematic behaviors getting institutionalized in conference talks, training programs and so-called certification programs for product people.\nI have talked about this issue several times in the past, most specifically in the article and keynote on Empowered Product Teams.  However, so many people hear only what they want to in that, and it has become clear to me that I need to be more explicit.\nSo while this article might be painful to read, if you’ve been frustrated with the contradictory and confusing messaging from people in the product world, if you bear with me here, I am hopeful that this will provide some much needed clarity.\nProduct Teams vs Delivery Teams\nIn the tech world, there are really three distinct types of, loosely speaking, “product teams.”\nThe most common in terms of sheer numbers are not really product teams at all, they are delivery teams.  Also referred to as “dev teams” or “scrum teams” or “engineering teams” and if your company is running something like SAFe, then unfortunately this is you.  In this situation, there are some number of developers, and a product owner.  The product owner in this model is what I refer to as a “backlog administrator.”  Someone does need to do this administrative work, but this is all about delivering output, and it’s really very little to do with what I am concerned about in terms of the need for true, consistent innovation on behalf of our customers.  I’ve written elsewhere about why this model is really just re-packaged waterfall, and is not used at true tech product companies.  So let’s get that out of the way.\nThis article is really about the difference between the other two types of teams.\nProduct Teams vs Feature Teams\nNow fair warning that I am about to introduce some nomenclature that is non-standard and certainly not agreed upon.  But I need to do this because today as an industry we refer to both of the other types of teams as “product teams” or “squads.”  But as you’ll see, while they look similar at a superficial level, they are dramatically different, especially when we talk about the role of the product manager.\nWhen I wrote about the virtues of empowered product teams, I was referring to what I’ll continue to call here as product teams.  Specifically, they are cross-functional (product, design and engineering); they are focused on and measured by outcomes (rather than output); and they are empowered to figure out the best way to solve the problems they’ve been asked to solve.\nThe purpose of a product team in this sense is to solve problems in ways our customers love, yet work for our business.\nAs much as I might wish otherwise, I know that only a small percentage of teams out there are product teams in this sense.\nMuch more often than not, the teams are not empowered at all.  In contrast, they are there to serve the business.\nIn this article, I will refer to this third class of teams as feature teams.  I am bending a little bit the more established definition of feature teams here, but I am using the term because it helps to highlight that these teams are all about output.  Features, and occasionally projects.  Usually provided to the team in the form of a prioritized list that is called the roadmap.\nEmpowered Product Managers vs Feature Team Product Managers\nBut here’s where I need to go deeper.\nRecall that in product there are always four risks:\nValue risk (will people buy it, or choose to use it?)\nUsability risk (can users figure out how to use it?)\nFeasibility risk (can we build it with the time, skills, and technology we have?)\nBusiness Viability risk (will this solution work for the various dimensions of our business?)\nIn an empowered product team, the product manager is explicitly responsible for ensuring value and viability; the designer is responsible for ensuring usability; and the tech lead is responsible for ensuring feasibility.  The team does this by truly collaborating in an intense, give and take, in order to discover a solution that work for all of us.\nWhen I talk and write about how tough it is to be a true product manager of an empowered product team, it’s precisely because it is so hard to ensure value and viability.  If you think it’s easy to do this, please read this.\nHowever, in a feature team, you still (hopefully) have a designer to ensure usability, and you have engineers to ensure feasibility, but, and this is critical to understand: the value and business viability are the responsibility of the stakeholder or executive that requested the feature on the roadmap.\nIf they say they need you to build feature x, then they believe feature x will deliver some amount of value, and they believe that feature x is something that is viable for the business.\nIt’s worth pointing out that even though the stakeholder is the one implicitly responsible for value and viability, they will still find a way to blame you and your team if their hoped-for results are not realized.  It took too long, the design was bad, critical capabilities were cut to make the date, etc.  And of course your team was probably never convinced this was worth building in the first place.  It’s an old song and I’ve written extensively about this problem.\nSuperficially, a feature team and a true empowered product team are both squads.  So they look similar, but the differences run deep.\nLet’s start with the role of the product manager.  In an empowered product team, where the product manager needs to ensure value and viability, deep knowledge of the customer, the data, the industry and especially your business (sales, marketing, finance, support, legal, etc.) is absolutely non-negotiable and essential.\nYet in a feature team, that knowledge is (at best) dispersed among the stakeholders.\nIn any case, hopefully it’s clear that the responsibilities of the product manager in this model are very different for a feature team.\nThe job of the product manager on a feature team is most commonly described as a form of facilitator, “herding the cats” in order to get the feature designed and delivered, or some nebulous and weak form of cross-functional leader that’s not really responsible for anything specific.  These feature teams will often think they are doing product discovery, but really it’s just design and maybe a little usability testing.\nBut there are other consequences of the feature team on the product manager role.\nBecause the team is not empowered – to be clear, when you’re given output to deliver you are not empowered in any meaningful sense – it is very hard to attract and retain true product designers (someone skilled at service design, interaction design, visual design and user research).\nIn the vast majority of cases where you have feature teams, the designer (if there is one) is a graphic designer.  It’s not that graphic or visual design is not important, but what’s relevant here is that now there’s a big gap – someone needs to figure out at least the interaction design and hopefully do some user research.  Hence it’s very common to see pressure on the product manager in this model to try to fill these gaps.\nThere are additional negative consequences of this situation, as it’s not hard to learn the tools that designers use, but it is hard to learn how to do good design and user research.   Sadly, many product managers have never had the opportunity to work with a true, professional product designer, so they don’t even know what they’re missing.\nIf you are fortunate enough to have a true product designer on your team (at least until they leave to move to a company where their skills are able to be fully utilized), then they usually (and rightfully) question what the purpose of the product manager is, as it’s not hard for them to pick up the additional responsibilities of the feature team product manager as they’re doing the bulk of the work anyway.\nThe result is that in feature teams, the product manager role is mainly project manager, and partly (unskilled) designer.\nThere is often a similar frustration with the engineers.  The product manager that is really a project manager is often at odds with the way the engineers believe they need to be working.  Not to mention that in this model, the engineers are relegated to delivery, and as I’ve said many times, if that’s the case we’re only getting about half their real value (so again, the good ones will want to leave and join an empowered product team where they can truly practice their craft).\nSo just to close on this critical point, when I write that the product manager needs to “be among the strongest talent in the company,” and “the CEO should view the product managers as potential future leaders of the company,” and “the strong product manager is the CEO of the product,” I am most definitely not talking about a product manager for a feature team.\nProduct Team vs Feature Team Indicators\nHopefully at this point you know if you are working in a feature team model or an empowered product team model, but I have learned that people are often very reluctant to admit when they’re in the feature team model.\nSo here are some tests you can apply to your team:\nAre you provided roadmaps with prioritized features and dates, or are you assigned problems to solve with business outcomes?\nIs there role confusion between you and your designer?\nIs there role confusion between you and your delivery manager?\nDo you spend most of your day doing project management?\nDid you try using OKR’s and was it a mess, either ending up being rejected, or some contrived mashup of outcomes and features delivered?\nDo you have a team of missionaries or mercenaries?\nWhat is the level of accountability?\nWhile product and feature teams look very similar on the surface, they are dramatically different in how they operate, the level of empowerment and accountability, and especially the responsibilities of the product manager.\nI can tell you that with few exceptions, the best product teams at the best companies are all about the empowered product team model.  However, I will admit that even in what I consider the best product companies, not every product team is empowered.  In truth, some are feature teams.  Usually that’s because the leadership does not yet trust that particular team.  Sometimes that trust needs to first be earned.  And sometimes the issue is with the leader wanting to dictate solutions.\nI have never tried to hide my strong bias toward truly empowered product teams.  But I believe I now need to go further than just advocating for empowered teams; I need to call out feature teams, the problems they cause, and the poor results they deliver.\nCountless companies today realize the futility of the delivery team model, and they know they need to transform into a true, technology-powered product company, yet they think they can “check that box” by making the superficial changes to move to these feature teams.\nAs I close here, I want to emphasize the difference between being a product manager for an empowered product vs feature team.  It is a completely different job, requiring a very different skill set.  It probably should not even be same job title.\nIt is sad to me that so many designers and engineers have never been exposed to a true product manager, and have never been able to work on a truly empowered team.  This is why I argue that there is so much underutilized talent out there, and why I continue to try to persuade people to try working like the best companies do.\nOne thing you can do immediately is that the next time you read a product-related article or tweet, attend a conference talk, or attend some product training, consider whether the author, speaker or trainer is talking about the empowered product team model, or the feature team model?\nUPDATE: I have posted a follow-on article addressing many of the questions I have received about this post.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925855783,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Articles - Page 2 of 29 - Silicon Valley Product

Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my last article I wrote about the trends of continuous discovery and continuous delivery.  At the end of the article I pointed out that while I love these techniques because overall they are much better for our customers, and for our ability to rapidly improve our products, there were a few important consequences that had to be dealt with.  In this article I want to take about the impact of continuous delivery on product marketing and our marketing, sales, and service organizations.\nFirst, to be clear, I am talking here about frequent releases – defined as at least every other week, but in the true form of continuous delivery, as many as several “micro-releases” a day.\nPlease note that I am assuming that your team is consistently releasing no less frequently than once every two weeks.  If this is not true, and especially if you are a SaaS company, you really need to fix this immediately in order to remain competitive (see www.svpg.com/big-bang-releases).\nIt is easy in an environment with very frequent release vehicles to have something go live to site that catches people by surprise.  Maybe by changing how customers use your site for an important task, or the way a sales demo works, or by breaking a work-around provided by customer service, or by any number of other cases.  While you can never totally predict and prevent surprises, we want to do what we can to prevent this.\nIt’s important to note that most of the time, when we make a typical incremental release, there’s nothing in there that will bother anyone.  Your customers won’t notice the differences, your sales people won’t know or care, and your customer service people won’t know or care.  We’re often changing things in the innards of the systems or fixing minor problems.  You might communicate with specific customers that were waiting for a specific fix, but for the most part these releases are not the issue.\nBut there are of course times when the thing we are releasing is something that will visibly impact customers or different stakeholders in our organization, and we want to be sure to manage this change appropriately.\nOne reason this is such an easy problem to run into is that the people implementing the change, the developers, may not always know the customer impact.  The product manager will typically know, and can and should flag the associated product backlog items appropriately and give a heads-up to product marketing.\nHowever, one of the reasons this communication and coordination can be challenging is that while the product manager owns the product backlog and the priority, he doesn’t really control when something is actually built and tested and ready for delivery.  Many times backlog items have dependencies on other work and specific people, and the precise sequencing and timing is not necessarily clear to the product manager.\nOne popular technique to manage this and prevent unhappy surprises is a simple “Customer Impact Assessment” check, which is done just prior to pushing changes live.  The release manager or product manager will usually check with product marketing to make sure that those impacted have been prepped.  This is most common in organizations with a direct sales and/or customer support organization, such as enterprise software companies.  This is usually a less common issue for consumer internet companies.\nIn enterprise companies, the product marketing people play a very key role in sales and services enablement, and they will usually be your go-to person to message to these organizations.\nDuring this “Customer Impact Assessment” we typically categorize the changes into three buckets:\nNot visible\nVisible but harmless – no need to highlight\nVisible and potential customer impact – need to ensure appropriate stakeholders and customers are notified\nIt is the third bucket that gets the attention, and the product marketing person will usually take the lead on this.  Hopefully the product manager informed the product marketing person that this was coming and she confirms that everything is set to go.  But maybe this was missed, or maybe nobody expected that this would be ready to release so soon.  In this case, it is possible that the product marketing person will ask that the feature or change not be pushed live, or if it is pushed live, it be pushed dark (which means it’s not visible to customers).\nOne last point here.  So far I’ve just been talking about how to deal with changes that have customer impact.  There is also an increasing trend in user experience design to design the changes with customer impact in mind, such that we minimize disruption and ease discovery of new capabilities.  In other words, we can in many cases prevent customer impact issues rather than manage them.\nBeing sensitive to customer impact will prevent most of these potential issues from becoming actual issues.  But it’s important to keep this in mind as we all move to more frequent releases.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/assessing-customer-impact/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925831660,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Becoming a Product Coach - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nOver the past couple of years, I have been more vocal about the industry’s need for more skilled product coaches.  Partly this is due to the sheer volume of companies that today realize they need to adopt the practices of the best companies.  And partly this is a reaction to seeing so many people calling themselves “coaches” (usually “agile coaches”, but also and increasingly “career coaches”) that have never served in a product role or even worked at a serious product company, and have no real idea how to help a product company.\nThe result is that more people than ever have reached out to me wanting to learn more about a career as a product coach.\nIn this note, I want to try to capture what I’ve thus far been sharing individually.  A few of these specific topics I’ve written about before, but I wanted to go deeper here, and bring everything together into a single article.\nFirst and foremost, this note is intended for aspiring product coaches.  \nAs a secondary goal, I am also hoping that those people that are considering hiring a product coach will benefit as well by giving them a better understanding of what the various product coaching options are, and what to look for in a strong product coach.\nPRODUCT COACHING PREREQUISITES\nRelevant Experience\nI wanted to get this big topic out of the way right up front.  \nI acknowledge that there are different points of view on what I’m about to say here, but I make no apology for my strong opinions on this question.  \nTo be absolutely clear: I do not see how a person can be an effective product coach without actual, relevant product experience.\nThis is why an agile coach that has never been a product manager or product designer is rarely helpful when a team is struggling with product discovery.\nThis is why a career coach that has never been a product leader is rarely helpful to a product leader trying to come up with a good team topology or a strong product strategy.\nThis is why a management consultant that’s never led a successful product transformation is rarely helpful to a CEO trying to lead her company through the necessary changes.\nThis is not to say that there aren’t useful skills that anyone can learn that would be helpful, such as becoming a better listener, techniques for engaging in difficult conversations more constructively, and methods for encouraging a growth mindset.  \nBut here is the key point: these skills are only helpful if built on top of a foundation of relevant experience.\nSo the people I personally encourage to explore a career in product coaching all have this in common: they have all demonstrated that they have a strong grasp of the foundational principles, concepts and techniques.  \nMost have worked several years at strong product companies.   Some have worked a dozen or more years at less impressive companies.  But they’ve all been in the trenches grappling with product and technology challenges.\nIf you don’t have this experience, and you want to become a product coach, then my advice is to first go get that experience.\nThe specific experience you need depends on the type of product coaching you would like to do.  We’ll discuss the specific types of product coaching at the end of this note.\nGenuine Desire To Help Others\nMany people are drawn to product coaching because of its flexibility, the chance to be your own boss, or the ability to work with lots of different companies.  While all these things can be true, they really shouldn’t be the main driver.  \nWhat’s much more important is a genuine desire to help develop others.\nWithout that genuine desire to help others, it’s hard to stay motivated especially during the early years where you are still building your client base and you don’t have much revenue coming in.\nPaying The Bills While Building A Business\nI know many people that have the relevant experience, and they love to help others, but they have not been able to move into the product coaching role because they don’t have sufficient funds to support themselves while they build up a coaching business.\nI do know a few people that were able to ramp up a client base faster, but realistically, for most people, it’s on the order of 2-3 years before the revenue is consistent, and at the level it was prior to starting a product coaching business.\nUnlike the first two prerequisites, there are a couple of alternatives for this one.  If you don’t have the personal funds to meet your needs for 2-3 years, you can try one of two alternatives:\nFirst, try to get a job as an in-house product coach.  Many of the large companies have a number of in-house coaches of multiple types.  It can be a cost-effective solution for the company.  You get a steady income, and a chance to develop your skills as a product coach.  The main downsides are that you are just exposed to a single company, and you are still an employee rather than your own boss.\nSecond, try to get hired as a product coach by a coaching agency.  As with an in-house coach, you would be their employee, but you would usually have multiple clients.  The upside is that they worry about finding the clients, and you get a consistent salary.  The downside is that they get most of the revenue, you don’t get the benefits of being your own boss, and you are really helping to build their brand rather than your personal brand.\nI should mention that some people tackle this problem by trying to build their coaching skills by moonlighting (working as a coach as a second, part-time job).  This seems to be better tolerated by employers in Europe than the US, but if you can do this and you’re willing to work the necessary hours, it’s a possibility.\nTYPES OF PRODUCT COACHING\nThere are of course any number of types of product coaching possible, but overall I see three primary types of product coaching:\nLet me say up front that these different types of coaching I’m about to describe are not mutually exclusive.  I know more than a few coaches that are very capable of coaching at multiple levels.  But I think it’s also true that even with those people, they have a strong preference for where they like to spend their time.\nDiscovery Coaching\nThe foundation of product coaching is discovery coaching.  I’ve written about this type of coaching before as it’s so important.  Just as product teams looking to improve their delivery skills will often use an Agile coach to help them improve on delivery, teams learning to do product discovery often benefit from discovery coaching.\nI see more discovery coaching opportunities out there than anything else, simply because there are so many product teams out there asking for help.  Moving from a feature team to an empowered product team primarily means learning how to discover a solution worth building, and this is what product discovery is all about. \nAll the successful discovery coaches I know are former product managers or product designers, who have learned the skills and techniques of effective product discovery, and love to share their knowledge with others.\nProduct Leadership Coaching\nIf you’ve ever done the head of product role at a serious product company, you already know that product leadership is hard.  Especially when trying to move from a feature-team based organization to empowered product teams.  There are now big and critical topics like product vision, team topology, product strategy, team objectives, and of course developing their own staffing and coaching skills.\nMany people, especially in rapidly growing companies, have had “battlefield promotions,” and now find themselves leading product, design or engineering, and they know they need help.  The client here is usually the Head of Product and/or the Head of Engineering/Technology.\nAll the successful product leadership coaches I know are former heads of product or heads of technology, who have figured out how to tackle these big topics, and want to share what they’ve learned with others.\nTransformation Coaching\nThe third main type of coaching I see are those that help guide the senior leadership team through the necessary changes in mindset and culture needed to move from a feature-team based company to empowered product teams (aka moving from a project to product-based culture).\nThe client in this case is usually the CEO or GM of a large business unit.  They know they need to change product and engineering, but they know it will be even more difficult to change the way they fund (finance), the way they staff (HR), the way they market and sell (sales and marketing), and more.\nWhat makes this type of coaching especially tough is that the vast majority of CEO’s simply won’t trust the future of their company to a product coach that has not “been there and done that” as a senior leader with other large and complex companies.  \nThey need someone that can hold their own with the company’s CFO, and explain to the head of sales why changes are necessary, yet can also engage directly with engineers, designers and product managers.\nIt’s little wonder why so few transformations succeed.  There are just very few people equipped to help.  In every successful transformation I know, there was someone that knew what was necessary, and had a trust-based relationship with the CEO.\nOther Types of Coaches\nIn addition to the very common Agile/Delivery Coaches I already mentioned, there are also several specialty coaches including OKR Coaches, Architecture/Tech Debt Coaches, CEO/Executive Coaches, Career Coaches, Growth and/or Retention Coaches, Marketing Coaches and Sales Coaches, and more.  But my focus in this article is on product coaches.\nTYPES OF CLIENTS\nThe other major dimension in product coaching is the type of client you focus on helping.\nBroadly speaking, there are three main types of clients:\nStartups\nA lot of attention is focused on startups because they are both fun to work with, and very much laser focused on product.  \nStartups are all about getting to product/market fit, and that means getting serious about product discovery.  Everything else is secondary.\nThe problem is that startups are usually the least willing and able to pay for coaching services.  \nIn some cases they are willing to pay with equity, but that’s not usually so helpful to a product coach worried about cash flow.  Some product coaches address this by only working with “well-funded startups.”\nAs the startup grows, product leadership challenges emerge as well, although the magnitude of those challenges is typically less severe than those of growth stage or enterprise companies.\nGrowth-Stage / Scaleups\nOnce a company does achieve product/market fit, there are a whole new set of challenges, especially on the product front.  \nNow the company has to get serious about staffing and coaching their growing ranks of product people.  They have to not only continue to grow their current product, but they usually need to also discover new and adjacent product opportunities.\nAnd while topics like team topology and product vision are less urgent for startups, once you have several or especially dozens of product teams working together, the topology, vision and product strategy topics become not just more difficult, but also more critical.\nThe result is that growth-stage companies typically benefit from both discovery and product leadership coaching.\nThese growth-stage companies make great clients.  They generally have good funding because of their success thus far, and they have significant product needs.  The downside is that there aren’t so many companies in this stage.  Only a small fraction of startups get to product/market fit, so most fade away before making it to this stage.\nEnterprises\nWe often use the term “enterprise” to refer to large, established companies.  For many people this term has a negative connotation – they imagine big, slow banks and insurance companies.  But Amazon, Google, Apple and Netflix are large established enterprises too, and it’s important to highlight that enterprises can indeed be exceptionally good at consistent product innovation.\nBut of course most enterprises do not work like Amazon, which is why these enterprises represent the largest segment of clients.  They have the funds, they definitely have the need, and because of their size, they have hundreds of product teams and dozens of product leaders at each enterprise – sometimes far more than that – that need your help.\nThe downside of enterprises is that in many cases they are so far behind the curve, and they waste so much time and money, and there is so much company politics, that you can’t help but wonder how they are still in business.  More generally, it’s very tough in an enterprise to make more than just an incremental impact.\nBut due to the size of the market and the level of need, for many (most) product coaches, this is their primary source of clients.\nYOUR BIGGEST DECISION\nThere’s no law that says you can’t create a product coaching business that tries to provide all three types of coaching to all three types of clients.  And it’s plausible to have a long-term vision to do just that.\nHowever, just as it’s very difficult to create a product that tries to please everyone, it’s very difficult to create a product coaching business that tries to please everyone.  \nSo I encourage everyone that wants to build a product coaching practice to focus on one type of product coaching for one type of client.\nSome popular examples: \ndiscovery coaching for enterprises\nproduct leadership coaching for growth stage companies\ntransformation coaching for enterprises\ndiscovery coaching for startups\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t accept a new client from a different client segment, or try providing a different service, but it does mean that when you present yourself as a product coach, you are highlighting why you are uniquely qualified to help a specific type of client with specific services.\nWhen I’m discussing the various possibilities with an aspiring product coach, I’m looking for that intersection of their personal interests (what they love), with their actual experience (what they’re qualified for).\nIn truth, many people fail in building a product coaching practice because they have real blind spots as to their abilities, which goes back to the prerequisites we discussed earlier.\nYou may already know what you want to focus on as a product coach, or you may still be uncertain.  If you’re unsure, I’m hoping that the sections that follow will help give you a better sense of each of these options.\nCOACHING VS CONTRACTING\nOne of the most important lessons to learn about coaching, if you haven’t already, is that there is a very big difference between doing a thing for a client, versus coaching them on how to do that thing.\nMany company leaders will see a potential product coach and say, “you have clearly demonstrated that you can create a strong product strategy; we’d like an engagement with you where you provide us a product strategy.”  In this case, you are not a coach.  You are a contractor engaged on a deliverable – their product strategy.\nThis may initially seem ok to you, but in general, it is not scalable.\nYou can coach a dozen product leaders on creating an effective product strategy, but you can likely only produce a single strong product strategy in that same amount of time and effort.\nThis is why so-called “fractional product leaders” are so difficult to do well in the product space.  A fractional CPO / VP Product is signing up to actually deliver the critical deliverables as head of product.  You are not there to coach or advise – you are there to deliver.  Maybe you can cover the product leader role for 2 or 3 organizations.  Although in my view, the product leader role is not well-suited to part-time work.  It’s an immersive role.\nIn any case, there will be many cases where your client will want your help on a deliverable – to fill open product positions, to come up with their product vision, and/or their product strategy, or to run their quarterly objectives planning process, or any number of other product leadership responsibilities.\nYou can of course take on as much of this as you like.  Just be warned that if you sign up for a deliverable, and you seriously underestimate the effort that will be required to do a quality job on that deliverable, then this will likely be on you (if you have to go back and renegotiate your contract because you didn’t know what you were getting into, it’s clear to that leader you don’t know as much as they had hoped, and also you’ve likely lost any chance at a strong testimonial), and so you’re in for some very long weeks.\nLikewise, realize that this type of business is all about reputation and word-of-mouth referrals, so it can be very costly in future clients to do anything less than an excellent job on that deliverable.\nCOACHING VS TRAINING\nMany very well established product coaches (think Teresa Torres, Melissa Perri, Jeff Patton, Shreyas Doshi, and also us at SVPG) have scaled their coaching to the level of offering training courses of various forms – cohort-based training, bootcamps, private and public workshops, etc.  \nThere’s a good reason for this.  By productizing your work, you can impact a large number of people, and it is very lucrative, especially as measured by revenue per day of your time.\nHowever, a common mistake I see new product coaches make is that they think they can start by offering similar courses.  The result is that they almost always struggle to fill seats.\nWhat I try to explain is that these courses depend on a base of clients that know and trust you, and a base of expertise that you have built by working with many clients.  So this note is really about building that base of clients and that experience.  \nIf you succeed at doing that, it opens the door to some great additional opportunities.\nTYPES OF PRODUCT COACHING BUSINESSES\nThere are of course many different ways to structure your product coaching business.  Each has pros and cons.  But this decision will very directly affect your quality of life, so it’s important to think carefully about what your goals really are:\nIndependent Coach\nThe most common type of product coach is an independent coach.  These people create their own entity so that they can work independently for whatever clients they like.  \nThe downside is that you’re a one-person company, so it’s all on you – in addition to the coaching itself, there’s the marketing and sales required to get clients, and the invoicing required to get paid.  Another downside is that it can be somewhat lonely.  Even though you’re interacting with lots of clients, you’re still a bit of an outsider.\nThe upside is that you are your own boss.  The amount of hours you work in a day is up to you.  The type of clients you work with is up to you.  \nHere’s an example of an independent product coach.\nIn-House Coach\nAn in-house coach is a product coach for a single client.  In-house coaches are usually employees of that company, just like an engineer or product manager.  But sometimes they are on a long-term contract.\nThe downside is that it’s just the one company, for better or worse.  Another downside is that because the organization views you as just another employee, it gradually becomes more difficult to get the company to pay much attention to your coaching.  You quickly lose the aura of expertise.  The main upside is that you don’t have to worry about who your next client will be.\nCoaching Partnership\nMany independent product coaches decide for various reasons to partner up with one or more other independent product coaches.  Sometimes these partnerships are structured as LLC’s, sometimes they are small corporations, and sometimes each partner retains their own entity, and the partnership is just to communicate to clients that you are part of the same coaching brand.\nOne upside of this is that this relationship addresses the loneliness issue described above.  Another upside is that you now have someone to share the load with.  Coaching can be feast or famine, and so you have someone that can help when the load is high.\nThe main downside is that you need to be extremely careful about who you partner with, because now you are tying your reputation to that of your new partner(s).  If any one of you disappoints a client, it reflects on all of you.\nIf you pursue this path, it’s very important that you each have a clear understanding of how decisions will be made, what responsibilities each partner will have, how shared expenses will be covered, how revenue will be divided, and what will happen if you decide to dissolve the partnership.\nSVPG is an example of this type of business.\nCoaching Agency\nIn general, product coaching is not very scalable.  But one way to scale, at least to a degree, is to hire more junior staff that you can funnel work to.  This is the agency model.\nThe upside is that the owner gets a percentage of the revenue from assigning the more junior people, and of course you can serve a larger number of clients.\nThe downside is that now there is real pressure to keep these junior people fully utilized.  Also, it can be very hard to maintain quality with more junior people, and you have to constantly be sensitive to the complaint of a “bait and switch” where the client hired you because of your personal track record, yet then you send a more junior person that is likely less impressive.\nHere’s an example of a product coaching agency.\nMARKETING YOURSELF\nMost product coaches would much rather spend their time actually coaching than anything to do with marketing or sales.  But I try very hard to impress upon them that they are their product, and marketing themselves effectively is critical.\nThey need to realize this, and then take seriously how they present themselves as a product.\nYour LinkedIn Profile\nAt a bare minimum, this means having a strong LinkedIn profile.  \nMost product coaches have some significant number of years in the industry already under their belt, but they have never taken the time to seriously review their professional profile.\nA profile for a product leader or a product manager should be very different from a profile of a product coach.  The companies you’ve worked for and the jobs you’ve held don’t change, but what you choose to emphasize and elaborate on definitely should.\nYou want your profile to do everything possible to substantiate your focus in terms of type of product coaching and type of client.  And endorsements take on a much more significant role for a product coach.  You want to gather and curate a strong set of endorsements.\nBut your LinkedIn profile is the easy part.  What really matters is how you describe your coaching business.\nMARKETING YOUR COACHING BUSINESS\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve been asked about a potential coach, and after providing a name, the first thing the potential client does is try to find the coaches’ website.  If there is none, you can see their skepticism.  If there is one, but it’s weak, then that’s not much better.\nThese are the ten questions that I see potential clients trying to get answers for.  I am pretty confident that they have these questions because when they can’t see the answer they often ask me if I know.\n1. How do I find you?\nYou will need a strategy for how potential clients will find you.  There are a variety of tools and techniques for helping with this, including a content strategy (blogging, newsletters, podcasts, etc.), search engine marketing, advertising, speaking at conferences, referrals, and more.\nFor new product coaching businesses, it is mostly about referral and word of mouth marketing.  So, I encourage new product coaches to focus on doing a great job for their clients, and they will invite you back, and they will remember you when they move to other companies.\nAll the content strategies are fine, but they mostly help for the next point.\n2. Who are you?\nPotential clients want to quickly figure out who you are, and if you are someone they think they can learn from.  They’re looking for many of the same things they can find on the LinkedIn profile, but the focus here is on your coaching abilities and not so much your full professional history.\n3. What is your superpower?\nWhat is it about you that makes you special?  You ideally want this to strongly support your focus area.  For example, the reason you’re so good at product discovery is because you worked on a well-known and very innovative product.\n4. What do others say about you?\nTestimonials are so important in the coaching business.  People want to feel good about their decision to move forward with you.  It’s your job to help them with this.\n5. How can you help me?\nWhat are the services that you offer?  People want to see that you specialize in what they care most about.  This is why the strategy of being everything to everyone rarely works.  If I need help with product strategy, I want someone that clearly specializes in product strategy, not just someone that lists strategy along with dozens of other buzzwords.\n6. How should I think about your offerings?\nPotential clients are bringing their experiences and expectations to the search for a product coach, and your positioning will help them view your services the way you need them to think about getting their needs met.\n7. Do you have experience with my situation?\nIt’s one thing to simply describe your experience, but you need to describe your experience in such a way that potential clients see your experience as directly relevant to their particular situation.\n8. Can I trust you?\nA coaching relationship is built on trust, and right from the outset, the potential client is making a judgment call about whether you are trustworthy.  A good coaching site does everything possible, in ways large and small, to convey trustworthiness.\n9. Can I depend on you to be responsive?\nFrom very early on, the potential client is gauging whether they can depend on you.  One of the simplest ways the client makes a judgment on this is your responsiveness.  \nI can’t tell you how many times I provide a name of a coach, and then the client comes back to me and says that it’s been 2 days, and no response, so can they please have a different name?\nMy personal opinion is that if you want to establish a product coaching business, you need to respond in no more than 24 hours to every inquiry from prospective or current clients. \nIt’s fine to send a quick response saying that you received their message and will respond to them by a specific time, but it’s not fine to just respond when you get around to it.\n10. What’s an easy way for me to tell others about you?\nIf a potential client does decide to work with you, and they have a good experience, they want to know how they can share that with others – they want you to help them help you.\nHere’s some product coaches’ sites that do a good job answering these questions:\nhttps://fearless-product.com/\nhttps://www.floradevlin.com/\nhttps://infinify.com/\nhttps://eliaslieberich.com/\nhttps://www.bringthedonuts.com/\nhttps://www.h2rproductscience.com/\nhttps://richardrussell.co/\nPRICING AND PACKAGING\nThe specifics of pricing and packaging of course depend on the particular service you’re offering.  That said, there are some principles that are extremely important to understand, that will not only increase your revenue, but will also help guide your choices on services and packaging.\nSubscription Billing\nFor most new product coaches, I encourage them to focus on getting somewhere between 4-7 clients that sign up for ongoing services, and pay a quarterly subscription price (of usually somewhere between USD $10K and $25K per client per quarter).\nWhy at least 4 clients?  Because clients come and go, and you don’t want all of your eggs in one basket.  This number also virtually ensures you aren’t trying to play a fractional or contract role.\nWhy quarterly invoicing?  Because the idea is that this is an ongoing subscription service, but quarterly still lets them increase or decrease the level as their needs change, without having to go back into the sales process every week.\nTransaction Billing\nCertain services make sense to be priced for the specific service (such as for a discovery sprint or a vision sprint), but you want the price to be for the package (the outcome), and not on a per-hour or per-day basis (the time).\nMany new coaches make the mistake of charging an hourly rate, which is really the worst of all options.  The sales process takes almost as long, yet the revenue is negligible and not recurring.\nThe thing to keep in mind about product coaching is that the client is not just paying for your actual face time with them.  They are paying for your years of hard-earned experience that enables you to provide the necessary coaching.\nNormally the minimum billing would be for a day of work.  And I encourage you to set the daily rate such that it serves as a disincentive for daily work.  The ongoing quarterly invoicing relationship should be priced such that it is more financially appealing.  \nBilling monthly is not as good as quarterly, but it’s certainly much better than hourly or daily.\nI don’t personally bill for anything shorter than a day because of the overhead involved.  However, I often do calls and emails and coffees that take less than a couple of hours, and I don’t charge anything for that.  I consider it karma, and I do think people appreciate that and it contributes to goodwill.\nEXAMPLE PRODUCT COACHING SERVICES\nThere are of course a very broad range of specific product coaching services that are provided by hundreds of different product coaches.  You can simply browse the web sites of your favorite product coaches to see their offerings.\nThat said, there are some approaches and services that have proven effective for a range of product coaches, so I’d like to highlight several of these.\nI don’t discuss the pricing for each of these mainly because I don’t know what the range or average fees are.  And in truth it really depends on your personal track record more than anything else.  If you build a reputation for providing an excellent service, then in my experience you can raise your prices over time and people are very willing to pay for the strong results.\nDiscovery Coaching\nProduct Discovery Coaching – typically involves meeting with select product teams weekly to review their progress and address obstacles.\nDiscovery/Design Sprints – typically one week immersive coaching on product discovery – a great introduction to how good product teams work.\nProduct Management Coaching – can be either individual or group (e.g. all PM’s in an organization), where each week you provide coaching on important product topics, usually related to product discovery but can be more general.\nDiscovery Q&A Sessions – typically for an hour held every week or two, a forum for raising and answering questions related to ongoing product discovery work.\nProduct Team Staffing Program – helping to set up good job descriptions, selecting and training an interview team, coordinating with HR and/or recruiters on target candidates, participating in interviewing.\nProduct Team Onboarding Program – helping to set up (and optionally to run) an effective onboarding program for new product managers, product designers and engineers.\nProduct Manager APM Program – setting up and running an ongoing APM coaching program for high-potential product managers.\nProduct Leadership Coaching\nProduct Leadership Coaching – typically ongoing one on one coaching of the product leader on product topics and stakeholder management as needed.\nProduct Vision Sprint – typically a one week exercise with the goal of coming up with a compelling product vision.\nTeam Topology Review – facilitating the review of the organization’s team topology.  There is usually significant preparation for these, and involves engaging deeply with both engineering and product leadership.\nProduct Strategy Sprint – typically a one or two week exercise with the goal of coming up with a compelling product strategy.\nQuarterly Team Objectives – involves helping the product leader manage the quarterly team objectives process.\nTransformation Coaching\nTransformation Coaching – providing ongoing coaching for the key leaders as they work through the changes to their culture, their processes, their staffing and more.\nOrganization Assessment – figure out where the organization is relative to strong product companies (often done as part of other services).\nExecutive Briefing – explain to the senior leadership team the reasons for the necessary changes, and what that means for the different parts of the organization.\nStakeholder Briefing – moving to empowered teams changes the dynamics with stakeholders and these stakeholders want to understand how they can engage constructively and effectively with product teams.\nSUMMARY\nHopefully by this point you have more clarity about what’s involved in building a product coaching practice.  While there are definitely easier ways to make a living, I’m not sure there are too many more rewarding careers.  And the flexibility is hard to beat.\nThat said, the most important factor is the prerequisites described at the very beginning of this note.  If you are truly qualified as described in that section, then I see no reason why you can’t build a sustainable practice as a product coach, and if that’s your passion I hope you pursue this.\nIf you’re not sure if you’re qualified, then I hope you ask someone that you know is clearly qualified, and that you trust to give you an honest assessment.  You don’t want to let imposter syndrome stop you from pursuing your goals, but you also don’t want to deplete your nest egg chasing something you just don’t have the experience to deliver.\nSpecial thanks to Chris Jones, Gabi Bufrem and Alex Pressland for their review of drafts of this

Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my last article, Product Leadership Is Hard, I provided a high-level overview of what it takes to provide strong product leadership in a product organization built on empowered product teams.\nIn this article, I’d like to share with you several examples of strong product leaders.\nWhen I wrote the second edition of INSPIRED, I shared the back stories of six product managers that were behind some of our industry’s most iconic products.  I ended up publishing a summary of those stories in one of my most popular articles, and also the one I’m most proud of: Behind Every Great Product.\nThe reason I’m so proud of that particular article and of sharing those stories is because there have been so many people that have told me over the past few years how those stories inspired them to pursue a career in product, and to strive to make a difference.\nIn our new book EMPOWERED, we share the stories of eight strong product leaders – two leaders of product management, two of product design, two of engineering, and two leaders of companies.  I have known each of these leaders for many years, and have had the chance to see their leadership in action.\nIn the new book I asked each of these leaders to share their path to leadership, and a bit about their values and approach to building strong teams.  I’m very much looking forward to many more people discovering these leaders through the new book, and hopefully their examples will inspire other leaders.\nIn this article, I’ll introduce you to the eight leaders, and share some of my own thoughts about what makes each of these leaders special.  At the end of this article, I’ll share what I hope you take away from the examples these strong leaders provide.\nAvid Larizadeh Duggan \nAvid studied engineering but wanted to learn product, and I hired her early on at eBay and watched as she rose rapidly through the organization, and then on to a remarkable career in product, and eventually as a long-time investor and advisor to product teams as a partner at Google Ventures, and as a champion for helping women and minorities learn to code through Code.org.\nI’ve watched Avid build great teams at organizations ranging from a very early stage startup, up to very large enterprises, something very few leaders have been able to pull off.\n“Leaders need to focus on bringing strong people together and giving them greater freedom to generate ideas and execute them through collaboration.  A leader should articulate what needs to be done and why, and then let the team decide how best to do it.”\n“A leader needs to make her team feel safe…no one is smarter than everyone else, trust is established, collaboration is natural, and conflicting ideas are frequent and comfortable because it is safe to be candid.  That’s how good ideas become great ideas. By bringing out the best in your teammates, you find the best in yourself.”\nApril Underwood\nApril also began her career in engineering, but she soon understood enough about how product companies and product teams worked that she realized the right place for her was in product management.\nApril also learned business development, partner management, product marketing, and in general worked to get a much broader understanding of how tech companies worked.\nWhen she eventually moved into product management at Twitter, and later as the original head of product at Slack, she was able to draw on this broader range of knowledge and experience, and identify and recruit talent, to create one of the best product organizations in our industry.\n“Throughout my career, I have worn a variety of different functional hats—sometimes by choice, to learn a new skillset, and sometimes because the preferred PM ‘hat’ was out of reach for reasons beyond my control.”\n“Now, after having gained experience as a product executive, I realize that these sidesteps are actually my most valuable asset. They help me build bridges across organizational lines. And they help me bear in mind that the product is always in service of the broader company mission—not the other way around.”\nLisa Kavanaugh \nLisa began her career as an engineer at HP, and then joined a young Ask.com, and over the next 12 years, earned her way up through the engineering ranks to eventually become the CTO of what was by then a very large and global engineering organization.\nBut what has always defined Lisa is her passion for coaching and developing others.  Helping engineering leaders to become the leaders their companies need them to be.\nEspecially in engineering, most new managers are promoted because they have demonstrated strong engineering skills.  But making the transition from engineer to engineering manager is a very difficult leap for many leaders.\n“I often meet technology executives that have built a reputation for absolutely dependable execution. They have consistently put in the effort and delivered what they had promised. In many cases, they have had to move mountains to deliver, but they did. They are known for their reliable execution and that is a large part of their identity. But now the leader has been promoted to the level where her personal effort can’t scale, and her teams feel like they are being micromanaged.”\n“When you have built a career and identity out of one set of behaviors, and you realize you need to change, especially in ways that now depend on other people, this can take real courage.”\n“Every leader’s journey is different, but I have found over the years that if a leader truly wants to improve, and has the courage to take the leap of faith necessary to learn to trust others, that they can indeed disrupt themselves and become the leader their company needs, and that their employees deserve.”\nDebby Meredith\nI have known Debby for 25 years.  She was VP Engineering at Netscape Communications, responsible for the browser and browser-based products.  Since then, she’s built a reputation as someone that can join a tech company on an interim basis, and work her magic with the engineering organization and the senior leadership team to build trust and establish a strong working relationship between the engineers, product and the senior team.  At this point, Debby has helped transform the engineering organizations of more than 50 companies, many of which have gone on to considerable success.\n“Many startup founders or CEOs have never worked with strong engineering organizations, and it’s not uncommon to find leaders with fundamental misunderstandings about the role of technology, and the necessary contribution of engineers as a partner to product management and product design.”\n“People are the heart and soul of any company. And, trust can enable those people, working together effectively, to create and achieve far more than they ever imagined individually. This is the magic of successful companies.” \nAudrey Crane\nAudrey is a long-time designer, user researcher and design leader.  She was very fortunate to have learned her craft working for, and coached by, one of the true pioneers of modern product design, Hugh Dubberly, formerly the design leader at both Apple and Netscape.\nWhen I first met Audrey I was immediately struck by the power of her mind, and her unusual background with an education in pure mathematics and theater.  It was clear to me that she was born to solve hard problems with lots of constraints, which is the essence of great design.\nOver the years, I saw Audrey move from designing great products to designing great teams.\n“The most rewarding experiences of my career have been identifying talent and aptitude in people who weren’t aware of it themselves, and then convincing them that they’re great at whatever the thing is.  And working with a team—all operating in ways that they are passionate about or excel at—means being part of something so much greater than the strengths of any one individual person. Those teams are transformational, both in terms of how it feels to belong to one, and what they can accomplish.”\nChristina Wodtke \nSome people are just born coaches.  Drawn to the calling of helping others to reach their potential.  Christina is just such a leader.\nChristina learned her craft from some of the industry’s greats, including Irene Au.  She has had a long career initially as a product designer, and soon design leader, at several of the iconic product companies of Silicon Valley.  \n“I realized I needed to stop designing products, in order to start designing a place where good design could happen.”\n“I’ve been making teams out of groups of individuals ever since. Teams can make miracles happen when no individual can.”\nAbout seven years ago she joined the faculty at Stanford, where she teaches product design and human computer interaction to her very fortunate students.\n“I have always tried to pay it forward by investing in the lives and careers of others.”\nShan Lyn Ma\nI first met Shan-Lyn in 2009 when she was the original product manager for fast-growing Gilt Groupe in New York City.  But it was easy to see her potential.  After four years building the product team at Gilt, she was ready to found her own startup, Zola, an online wedding registry and planning company.  \n“Both (co-founder) Nobu and I believed that innovation comes from empowered teams of strong people working in a trusted environment. We deeply believed that we could provide an environment that valued and respected the people that worked there, and that this would help us provide the type of experience that engaged couples wanted and deserved.  Many founders say things like this, but we were willing to bet the company on this.”\n“We know that innovation thrives in environments where different perspectives are sought out and encouraged, so we made diversity an explicit goal from the beginning, for every open role. We of course wanted diversity in skills and talents, but also diversity in gender, in orientation, in education, and in approach to problem solving. Not only would this help us with innovation, but our users—engaged couples—come in every flavor and combination, so we believed this would help us at every level.”\nAnd indeed it has.  Zola is not only one of the NYC tech community success stories, but is also considered one of the best tech companies to work for.\nJudy Gibbons\nI have known Judy for most of my professional life, and am honored to call her my friend.  Judy has had an extraordinary career, as a long-time executive at Apple and Microsoft, and in venture capital at Accel Partners.  For the last ten years, she’s been asked to serve on several boards, usually when the company knows they need to get serious about transformation, but they are not sure how to go about accomplishing that.  \nAs a member of the board, Judy works with the CEO and the rest of the senior leadership team to help them through the necessary changes.  She has been there and done that herself many times, so she brings first-hand knowledge, along with an uncanny ability to see through noise and get to the essence of the issue.\n“Leaders need to establish and communicate a clear and compelling purpose and vision—what the organization is trying to achieve and why. There needs to be obsession with the customer from the top—who they are, what they want, and how they behave. And to develop the solution, there need to be highly-focused and effective cross-functional teams led by a capable product manager, empowered to deliver on the product vision. And this means clear objectives, accountability, constant interaction, and continuous learning.”\n“As a board member, I try to impress upon the senior leaders these principles and values, and emphasize that the product teams need to be empowered. Without this, there will be little progression, and a great deal of frustration which inevitably means that the necessary digital talent—which has been brought into the organization with great effort and cost—will walk out the door in search of a more worthwhile place to work.”\nKey Takeaways\nWhile each of these leaders is unique, and followed their own path to product leadership, what I find most interesting is how much they have in common:\nThey have all experienced the magic of strong, empowered product teams, and they strive to replicate that magic in the organizations they help.\nThey are all committed to coaching and developing others.  They all fundamentally believe in people, and measure their own success by the success of those they help.\nNone of them are generic people managers; they are all accomplished product professionals in their own right, which gives them the foundation they need to coach people from a position of first-hand knowledge.\nThey all understand that their “product” is now their people.\nThey are all genuinely good human beings; the kind of person most of us would want to work for and with.\nIn literally every truly strong product company I know, there are strong product leaders.  And if your organization hopes to transform from feature teams to empowered product teams, then what we’ve learned is that strong product leadership is key.  \nIf you’d like to know more about each of these leaders, you can find the full leadership profiles in the new book Chris Jones and I wrote: EMPOWERED: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/behind-every-great-company/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925919979,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Best vs. Rest Explained - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my last article, I shared with you some of the key learnings from The Lost Interview with Steve Jobs.  But there is so much gold in that 70 minute interview, that I wanted to highlight a different topic in this article.\nIf you read much SVPG content, you know that we’re all about the differences between how the best companies work, and the rest.\nYet in truth I have never had a good answer to the question of why there are still so many bad product companies?\nEspecially when the best are also the most valuable companies in the world.\nWhy wouldn’t more companies want those rewards?\nMy theory for this has mainly been that leaders at “the rest” have never worked at strong product companies, so they’ve never seen good.\nBut if you watched the full interview with Steve Jobs, you saw that he shared a different theory.\nI think his theory is more likely the root cause of most of these problematic companies, and also more helpful and constructive than my own explanation.\nSteve argues that for most established companies, innovation is simply not at the core of their DNA.  He argues that once they have established their business, the focus of the company quickly moves to sales and marketing:\n“I have my own theory about why the decline happens … The company does a great job … in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.”\nSince growth is based on sales and marketing, it is the successful sales and marketing people that get recognized, rewarded and promoted, and soon enough, they are the ones running the company.\nIt’s worth noting that the old P&G model of brand manager as product manager fit well in that model because that role was famously about pricing, packaging, positioning and promotion.\nIn any case, engineers and designers can either accept their secondary role, or they can move to a company that believes its success is dependent on consistent innovation.\nSo is it any surprise that when Apple hired a former Pepsi executive as their CEO, that the company lost its ability to create great products?\nWhen viewed through this lens, it is remarkable how many companies you can identify that lost their product mojo when they replaced their product-oriented founder with a so-called “professional” CEO, either coming from sales or marketing, or business development (when they think acquisitions are the key to growth), or finance (when they think managing costs is their key to growth).\nThe reason this explanation resonates so well with me is that I have known many of these CEO’s, and in most cases, it’s clear to me they are very smart people, but all too often they show so little interest, beyond lip service, in the machinery of consistent innovation.\nSteve Jobs is essentially describing the natural selection that occurs at companies where growth is not viewed as a function of product innovation.\nWhen combined with Marc Andreessen’s famous essay Why Software is Eating The World, it is easy to see why there are so many companies today that are ideal targets for disruption.\nDoes this mean that companies with CEOs that don’t come from product are doomed?  It’s tough to say.  Because transformation is so hard to do successfully even in the best of cases, many probably are.  But if the CEO is willing to get serious about developing new muscles, they may still have a chance.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/best-vs-rest-explained/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925840806,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Beware of Specials - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tHow many times have you seen the situation where a sales rep brings to the CEO a proposal from a prospect that says, “if you will just add these seven features to your product then we’ll buy your software and even pay you an extra $X.” Or, lest anyone thinks that this situation is unique to enterprise software companies, for consumer service companies, your ad sales person comes over saying that “a big prospective partner will sign a seven-figure advertising and sponsorship deal with you if you’ll just agree to these site integration and placement requirements.”\nEither way, these are what are known as “specials.” A special is when a company gets a big check from a prospective customer or partner with the condition that you build into your product exactly what they say.\nIt is entirely understandable why large customers and partners may seek this arrangement. And if you’re a small company that’s strapped for cash, it’s also very understandable that your CEO might be more than a little inclined to agree. After all, you’re going to be adding features anyway, so “why not let this customer underwrite these features?”\nSo what’s wrong with doing a special? Well, one of the surest ways to derail a product company is to confuse customer requirements with product requirements. I’ve written in depth elsewhere about the reasons why you can’t count on customers to describe the product that they need, but to summarize: first, it’s extremely difficult for the customer to know what he needs until he sees it; second, customers don’t have the time to be constantly exploring what’s now possible; and third, customers don’t often interact with each other in order to identify common themes.\nBut even if the customer doesn’t have these issues, more generally it’s not clear that these are the best things to focus on right now. By pursuing these special features now, what work are you delaying? What is the business cost of that delay?\nBut even assuming these are not issues, it is still dangerous. How come? Because your job is to meet the needs of a broad range of customers. That’s what distinguishes product companies from customer software shops. If a year from now the market changes, you need to be able to quickly change and adapt. If you are contractually obligated to keep supporting a specific way of doing things, then your business will not be as nimble as it needs to be. Remember that every version of your product will have to be built, maintained, tested, released, documented and supported. It doesn’t take too many specials to weigh down a company to the point where it takes them months to do even the smallest release.\nDon’t get me wrong. There’s nothing wrong with custom software shops. They provide an essential service for countless companies that need specialized solutions, and can often deliver that specialized solution at a fraction of the time and cost of in-house developed solutions. But custom software is a very different business than commercial product software.\nSo how do you avoid the pitfalls of specials? Undeniably it takes corporate discipline and experience to be able to recognize specials and be willing to walk away. This leadership comes from the CEO, but there is much you can do as product manager to help.\nFirst, it is natural for any customer to want to describe their problem in terms of the solution they can envision rather than the underlying problem itself. But as product manager it’s your job to work with the customer to tease out the core issues and needs. You can help them to recognize that there may be other approaches to this problem that provide a solution they would like even better. Most customers do not really want to be running on a custom version of software. They want to be running on your mainstream product, the one that gets the most attention, support and improvement.\nSecond, consider looking at how you could keep your product general purpose but allow the product to be tailored/customized/extended by the customer or by a solutions provider. And then have ready the names of a couple system integrator/solution provider companies that can tailor your product to meet this specific need. You may need to partner with the solution provider so that your customer doesn’t have to manage two relationships and have to worry about finger pointing if there are issues.\nSo far the examples have mainly been in the enterprise software space. But the problem of specials is becoming increasingly severe in the consumer internet services space, where for many companies, advertising that is not aligned with the site’s objectives has significantly distracted or even damaged the user experience.\nFor many advertisers, their main objective is very simply to move traffic from your site to their site. If this isn’t your goal, you’ve got a strategic conflict. For some sites, like directories or search engines, this is fine, but for others, you end up trading short-term traffic for your site’s future. This really isn’t in anyone’s best interest. Consider the revenue model of LinkedIn versus Friendster. LinkedIn is providing value-added services to their members and partners, and keeping them even more engaged in the process. In contrast, Friendster was doing everything they could to get members to go learn about Pamela Anderson’s TV show. I completely understand why Fox might want to reach Friendster’s members, but have a harder time realizing why Friendster would want to make this such a prominent part of their user experience, other than for short-term advertising revenue.\nI have found advertisers to be very interested in finding better, more synergistic ways to work together. When you have a strategy and a clear role for them, they are more than willing to work with you. They know that traditional internet advertising is of limited value, and they want something better as much as you do.\nWhether it’s enterprise software or consumer internet services, it’s the product manager’s job to ensure that you’re building the right product, and that the product will be applicable to and usable by a wide range of customers.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/beware-of-specials/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925955614,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Beyond Lean and Agile - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nI have been working exclusively with technology product teams now for a full 35 years, and I’ve seen countless processes, methodologies and techniques come and go.\nIn large part that’s the nature of the beast.  People are always searching for a silver bullet, and there is always a willing industry, ready and waiting to serve with books, coaching, training, and consulting.  But of course there is no silver bullet, and inevitably people figure this out, and then the backlash comes.  As I write this, it’s in vogue to criticize both Lean and Agile.\nI have no doubt that many people and teams are in some measure disappointed with the results from their adoption of both Lean and Agile. And I believe I understand the reasons for this.  That said, I am convinced that both Lean Startup and Agile values and principles are actually here to stay.  Not so much the particular manifestations of these methods that many teams use today, but the core principles behind them.  I would argue that they both represent meaningful progress, and I for one would never want to go backwards on those two fronts.\nBut as I said, they are not silver bullets either, and as with any tool, you have to be smart about how you use it.  I meet countless teams that claim to be following Lean principles, yet they work for months on what they call an “MVP” and they really don’t know what they have, and whether it will sell, until they’ve spent substantial time and money; hardly in the spirit of Lean.  Or they go way overboard and think you have to test and validate everything, so they go nowhere fast.\nAnd of course if you’ve read any of my articles, you hopefully know that the way Agile is actually practiced in most product companies is hardly Agile in any meaningful sense.\nSo in this article, I’d like to talk about what’s beyond Lean and Agile.  I believe that the best product teams have in fact already moved past how most teams practice these principles – leveraging the best of Lean and Agile, but raising the bar on what they’re trying to achieve and how they work.\nWhen I see these teams, they may frame the issues a little different, and sometimes use different nomenclature, but at the heart I see three fundamental principles at work:\n1. Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end.  In modern teams, we tackle these risks prior to deciding to build anything.  These risks include value risk (whether people will buy it), usability risk (whether people can figure out how to use it), feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have), and business risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business).\n2. Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.  They have finally moved beyond the old model where a product manager defines requirements, a designer designs a solution that delivers on those requirements, and then engineering implements those requirements, with each person living with the constraints and decisions of the ones that preceded.  In strong teams, product, design and engineering work side-by-side, in a give and take, to come up with technology-powered solutions that our customers love, and that work for our business.\n3. Finally, it’s all about solving problems, not implementing features.  Conventional product roadmaps are all about output.  Strong teams know it’s not only about implementing a solution; they must ensure that solution actually solves the underlying problem.  It’s about results.\nThe “dual track” model of continuous discovery work running in parallel with continuous delivery is predicated on these three principles.  Discovery is all about tackling the various risks before we write a line of production software.  Discovery is very much about the intense collaboration of product management, user experience design, and engineering.  And discovery is all about discovering solutions to the business problems we are assigned in our objectives (rather than implementing features on a roadmap).\nYou will also find the same three core principles behind design thinking and design sprints in parallel with delivery sprints, customer development running in parallel with product development, and the “build things that don’t scale” first mantra of Y Combinator.\nSo however you and your team care to visualize or describe how your work, what’s critically important is that you:\n1. Tackle the big risks early – especially value risk and business risk\n2. Figure out solutions collaboratively – engineering, design, and product, working side-by-side\n3. Focus on solving problems – it’s not about features or a roadmap; it’s about delivering results\nKeep these points in mind on your next effort and see if you can’t raise the bar on your results.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/beyond-lean-and-agile/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925761027,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Books Archive - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tNew!\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tTRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model\n\t\n\tHelp transform your business and innovate like the world’s top tech companies. \nWritten by Marty Cagan and his partners at SVPG, TRANSFORMED bridges the gap between where most companies are right now and where they need to be. \nTRANSFORMED has three big goals:\nFirst, the book will educate you with a deep understanding of the product operating model, and what it means to work that way.\nSecond, the book will convince you with detailed case studies of successful transformations, that while difficult, it is absolutely possible for you to transform your company to the product operating model.\nThird, the book will inspire you with truly impressive case studies of product innovation, showing what you too will be capable of doing once you successfully transform.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tNew!\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tLOVED: How to Rethink Marketing for Tech Products\n\t\n\tGreat tech products don’t always win.

My daunting mandate was to help transform the company. Although intimidated at first, I soon knew I would have a fighting chance the moment I learned I would be working alongside their new VP of Engineering, Jeremiah Ivan.\nOne of the early problems at Merrill was the bureaucratic, mental, and physical walls inhibiting any form of collaboration among employees. Fortunately, Jeremiah Ivan was the king of breaking down walls – sometimes with brute force.\nOne afternoon, while walking around Merrill’s offices, assessing the dated ten-foot-high cubicles dominating one room after the other, both Jeremiah and I agreed the cubicles had to go. Having a shared vision is key to successful transformation, as is troubleshooting potential solutions as a team.\n“You can’t just change your cubicle,” I explained to Jeremiah. “You need to submit a ticket and get permission. And it’s a union job, so getting approval can take months.”\n“Is there any way to speed it up?” Jeremiah asked.\nI thought about it for a moment, then told him the only way to circumvent the time-consuming approval process was to put in a repair request. Jeremiah nodded, walked over to one of the cubicles, raised his fist, and punched a hole in the wall.\nHe did the same to a second cubicle, then a third.\n“Christian,” he said with a broad smile, “these cubicles are definitely in need of repair. Let’s put in a request.”\nThat was Jeremiah Ivan – unconventional, sometimes even wild, but he always got your attention. And he simply made transformational change happen.\nAgent of Change\nTransformations are difficult. Nothing ever goes exactly as planned, and there are always bumps in the road. Throughout the journey from the current state to the future state, there will be naysayers, people at every level of the organization at every stage of progress, that either lose faith or are unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary to succeed. Lasting transformation requires multitudes of individuals to leap into the unknown, disrupting what they’ve defined as normal. It demands uprooting their vision to plant roots in something that is sometimes intangible.\nBecause of this radical expectation to trust the process, transformation requires special people to act as a catalyst – an incendiary spark to ignite change and keep it moving – for me, Jeremiah was that flame-thrower.\nNot only was he skilled at his job, and knowledgeable about the business and its industry, but to be a true agent of change, he also needed to have something extra. I soon discovered that extra something to be his tenacity.\nWhen fear inhibits buy-in, and uncertainty urges organizations to abandon ship and cling to the old ways, no matter how dysfunctional and obsolete, an actual agent of change stands up and says in a resounding voice, “Yes! We are on the right path,” and “No! We are not going to quit.”\nThat’s how I’ll always think of Jeremiah Ivan.\nHe was my friend and my colleague, but more importantly, he was an inspiration, one of the people that always helped keep me focused and moving forward when the journey seemed impossible. Jeremiah had a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to excellence. He also possessed an unwavering belief in what was right and was rarely swayed by arguments he thought were either self-serving or politically motivated.\nHe was a brilliant engineer, and above all, he was blessed with a holistic mind, able to visualize and understand all the seemingly unrelated variables attached to a product or project. Jeremiah wasn’t just the smartest guy in the room – he was also the most interesting and charismatic.\nA Charismatic Neighbor\nI started working at Snagajob in Richmond, VA in 2011 as their new VP of Product. At the time, I hadn’t relocated my family and needed a place to live. The company set me up in one of its corporate apartments, and there I met for the first time Jeremiah Ivan, Director of Engineering, my next-door neighbor.\nThough I’d just met him, I’d been briefed about him before signing on. By all accounts, he was smart, assertive, confident, brave, and willing and able to go toe-to-toe with any company executive and usually come out on top – perhaps this is because he loved to argue, and he was rarely wrong.\nI discovered this firsthand when Jeremiah invited me over to his apartment for a drink. Having an after-work drink with a colleague is a normal part of corporate culture, so my expectation for the evening was standard colleague banter: “How are you? Where did you work before this? What do you think of the city?”\nThat type of stuff.\nTo my delight, what I got was something totally different.\nDuring that first encounter, when he discovered I was from Africa, Jeremiah started talking about Highlife music. For those of you not familiar with the genre, Highlife originated in West Africa in the early 20th century. The music is characterized by a fusion of traditional African rhythms and Western instrumentation, featuring brass instruments such as trumpets, saxophones, and trombones. The lyrics are typically sung in local African languages and address a wide range of topics, including love, social issues, and politics.\nWhen Jeremiah brought up Highlife, he wasn’t doing so just because he wanted to make me feel comfortable; the guy was actually a fan, and he knew what he was talking about. He was not only familiar with musicians like King Sunny Ade and Fela Kuti, but he got even more profound, with a segue into Highlife’s impact on other African genres, including Afrobeat, Soukous, and Juju music.\nJeremiah had a wide-ranging mind, as comprehensive as it was eclectic. One moment he might be talking about local politics or world history, the next about the fall of the Bastille or the Japanese board game GO. He kept a room rolling with his jokes, and whenever he wanted to make a point, he used the most imaginative metaphors to make it memorable. He also loved wines and liquors and had an uncanny way of remembering everyone’s favorite drink.\nTo say I was impressed with his Highlife knowledge would be an understatement. Jeremiah Ivan was an original, a true force of nature with the brains and personality to connect with people. He was authentic and genuine.\nHowever, that didn’t mean that things always went smoothly.\nAt Snagajob, we often clashed. I decided what problems to solve, then his team did it. My management style is more coach-like, and I aim to nurture and seek out teaching moments. Jeremiah, on the other hand, was all fire and brimstone. In those early days, we argued nearly every day.\nIf he thought you were doing something wrong, he would tell you directly. And at the same time, he was fiercely loyal and would go toe-to-toe with anyone to fight for his team.  He might drive you crazy in the shadow of deliverable deadlines and the frenzy of transformation, but at the end of the day, when the dust had settled, he was the one person in the company everyone wanted to have a drink with. With his brain full of random trivia, metaphors, and jokes, balanced with a sharp drive to accomplish tasks on schedule, he organically connected dots and people.\nBringing People Together\nWhether punching through barriers to facilitate collaboration, keeping the fire for transformation burning within an organization to inspire change champions, or cultivating the fascinating fact farm in his brain with limitless stories to connect with anyone in the room, Jeremiah brought people together.\nAs VP of Engineering, another of Jeremiah’s responsibilities was to build a team of talented engineers. He needed to attract and retain people with both technical skills and the ability to think outside the box. Those kinds of people are not only hard to find but even harder to keep; they want to be both challenged and appreciated, and they need to be able to materialize something that doesn’t exist yet while maintaining excitement and trust from those that can’t envision what they can. These professional unicorns need to feel they are constantly growing by learning new skills and attacking new problems, which makes managing them very difficult, especially for someone with Jeremiah’s skills and intelligence because he was a unicorn, too.\nMost legends aren’t equipped to manage others. This is because the same talent that makes them irreplaceably valuable is something so rare it can be frustrating to work with others that don’t have that same special spark. Their standard of excellence begins at a level higher than most people can even imagine or reach, which can make meeting their managerial expectations nearly impossible. Take professional sports, for example. Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Diego Maradona – the list of great athletes that failed as managers is endless.\nBut not Jeremiah. Jeremiah Ivan was different. He didn’t just put together a team of engineers; he assembled and trained a Dream Team of standouts, exceptional by every measure. Sure, he was demanding as a manager. But when he cultivated a team that vibrated at the same frequency where he also excelled, those demands were neither unreasonable nor impossible – not in the moment or in the future. His legacy is not only in the memory of his presence, personality, and leadership but his brilliance lives on in the teams he built and left behind. He set up organizations for success to thrive even after he moved on.\nTransformations are never easy. They demand courage and fortitude, flame-thrower passion, and a sprinkle of humor. After working alongside Jeremiah through so many intimidating asks, nearly impossible assignments, complex projects, and never-seen-before products, he has transformed me, too. He elevated my baseline expectations of the kind of rare and wonderful catalysts I want next to me on any team. That’s why whenever I’m ready to get down in the trenches and take on a new challenge, I always make sure I have someone like Jeremiah Ivan standing beside me.\nIn times of despair and uncertainty, television icon Mister Rogers said, “Look for the helpers.” In the corporate world, when tasked to ignite groundbreaking metamorphosis, I say, “Look for the Jeremiahs.”  I think often, in our product work, we view our legacies as the problems we are able to solve and the lives we impact with the products we create.  And yes, that’s part of it, but Jeremiah showed me firsthand that your true legacy is the impact you have on lives around you – the teams you build, the leaders you stand shoulder to shoulder with, and the friendships you forge through even the toughest of times.\nToday marks the three-year anniversary of losing a product icon. I hope we all bring a little Jeremiah sparkle to our teams every day because I’m confident that is how we best live in his memory and continue to impact lives the way he always did. I join all the companies he served during his career – Snagajob, Rent the Runway, and Datasite to celebrate his life and legacy.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/breaking-down-walls/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925811676,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Changing How You Build - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Jon Moore and Marty Cagan \nRecently we shared an article defining what we mean by true transformation where we described three elements to becoming a strong, product-led company.\nIn the next three articles, we will drill into each of these three elements, and describe why these changes are so important to strong product companies.\nWhile these may be somewhat technical concepts, a deep understanding of technology is not required to understand the importance, and the value, to your business and your customers.\n—\nYour technology investment is all about creating value for your customers and your company.  \nThere are several important aspects to creating this value, but at the end of the day, the primary skill you depend on to build your products are engineers.  For most technology-powered companies, the engineers are the single largest cost.\nYet there is a wide range of tools, methods and processes that your engineers may use to actually build, test and deploy their products.\nBut much more important than the particular tools, methods or processes, are three core principles that lay at the foundation of how strong product companies build products:\n1. PROTECTING CUSTOMERS, REVENUE, BRAND, COLLEAGUES\nFirst and foremost, as we build and deploy our products, we need to do so in ways that protect our customers, protect our revenue, protect our reputation, and also protect our colleagues.\nIn modern technology-powered products and services, breaking the product can have immediate and damaging consequences to our users and customers, our revenue, our brand’s reputation, and our colleagues (especially sales and customer success staff). \nIf we cause a serious issue, it can create an outage for all the customers and users that use and depend on that service.  This is part of the price we pay for the many customer benefits of cloud computing.\nThis is why if a core infrastructure service such as Amazon’s AWS has a serious issue, much of the products that we depend on for our personal and professional lives are immediately impacted and often rendered inoperable.  This is very similar to a major power outage.\nWhile you can never protect against all possible problems, we have an obligation to constantly work to protect our customers from problems we cause when we build and deploy.\n2. RESPONDING TO MARKET NEEDS\nSecond, it’s important to call out that this is not just used for getting new capabilities to our customers.  \nIn every company, there will be times when something changes in the market, the competitive landscape, or the environment that causes things to stop working, to behave incorrectly, or perhaps due to regulatory or compliance changes, demand a change to our products, or your customers encounter some serious problem requiring immediate action. \nWhen there are serious issues that are impacting our customers, we need the ability to quickly diagnose the problem, create a solution, test that solution, and then deploy that solution.\nWaiting weeks or months is no longer acceptable for most companies today.  Strong product companies need the ability to respond quickly and competently to these market needs.\n3. EARNING THE TRUST OF OUR CUSTOMERS\nFinally, customers generally understand that occasionally problems will occur, but they judge us more by our ability to respond quickly and competently when those issues do arise.\nSimilarly, there are always situations where product teams need to be able to make what is called a high-integrity commitment.  This is when our customers or partners are depending on us for a specific deliverable, and they need to know they can count on that deliverable providing the necessary value, and also delivered when promised.\nIt is no secret in our industry that many companies have a terrible track record in terms of delivering on these types of promises.  But strong product companies know how important this is to building and maintaining trust with our customers.\nSMALL, FREQUENT, RELIABLE RELEASES\nThe core technique that is used to address each of these principles is the notion of small, frequent, reliable releases.\nThis means, at a bare minimum, each product team releasing every other week.  For the strongest product companies, this means releasing several times per day.\nThe reason you likely don’t know this is happening with your favorite products is precisely because they are releasing a near constant stream of small releases.\nAnd in order to consistently deliver small, frequent, reliable releases, we need to take very seriously our obligation to test, known more formally as quality assurance.  \nBut testing is more complicated than it may seem.  In general, we work to test two main aspects of what we build, the first is straightforward, and the second is less so.  \nThe first is that when we build a new capability, we need to test that the new capability will work as expected.  Straightforward, although since we will likely want to test and retest this new capability thousands of times in the coming months and years, we will usually invest in some level of test automation.\nThe second is to ensure that the changes made to enable the new capability do not unintentionally or inadvertently break anything else.  This is referred to as regression testing, and when you realize that many technology-powered products and services today are the result of literally hundreds of engineers working for many years, creating tens of thousands of interactions, you can see that ensuring that a complex product does not take a step backwards when a new capability is introduced can be a significant undertaking.\nThe main method product teams use to ensure that new capabilities work as advertised, and don’t introduce regressions, is to deploy a series of very frequent, very small changes.  \nThe smaller the release increment, the faster we can ensure the quality of the new capability, and the faster we can be confident we’re not introducing regressions.  And with these small, frequent releases, if a problem is introduced, it is much easier and faster to identify the cause (since we only changed a small number of things).\nIf this seems counterintuitive to you, and if you still believe that in order to ensure quality you need to release slowly and infrequently, then you owe it to yourself and your company to examine both the theory and the evidence on why frequent, smaller releases provide both more throughput and higher quality at strong product companies.  We recommend the excellent book Accelerate.\nUnfortunately, for many companies, they have not yet achieved the ability to do these small, frequent releases.\nInstead, they make hundreds or even thousands of changes, and then once a month, once a quarter, or even once a year, they will work to integrate all these changes together, and then try to test that all these new capabilities work as expected, and then they begin the grind of trying to identify and remove all the unintended consequences (regressions).\nAs you are hopefully beginning to realize, this is why large releases like this (these are known as big bang releases) are notorious for delays of weeks, or even months, trying to get everything back to a reliable, releasable state.\nIn fact, many products built this way never achieve a state of solid quality, and the customer is forced to deal with a constant stream of defects and issues, or else seek out a different solution provider.\nMoreover, even if the new release actually works as it’s supposed to (a very big if), the customer is forced to absorb hundreds or even thousands of product changes hitting them all at once, likely requiring retraining, recertification, reintegration, and otherwise significantly interrupting their own work to accommodate all the changes the company has forced upon them.  \nIn this case, it’s all too common for the customer to press your company to release less frequently, because they simply have no time to deal with this degree of change.  As you can hopefully see by now, while it is completely understandable why the customer would request this, doing so would be much worse for the customer, and worse for your company.\nCombined with the inability of the company to respond quickly and competently to critical issues, and you can hopefully see how customers would lose confidence in your ability to provide them the service they need. \nA NOTE ABOUT AGILE METHODS\nYou have almost certainly heard of Agile methods.  The main reason so many companies moved to Agile methods over the past twenty years is that these methods can provide the forcing function to get product teams to achieve these consistent, small, frequent releases.\nIt’s true that moving to small, frequent releases can require a significant investment, mainly in testing and deployment automation.  But for those companies that employed Agile methods to get them to release no less frequently than every other week, it has provided them and their customers real value.\nThat said, it’s important to understand that you don’t need Agile methods in order to have consistent, small, frequent releases.\nIn fact, many of the best product teams in the world have mastered the ability to consistently deploy these small releases (referred to as continuous integration and continuous deployment or “CICD”), yet they don’t follow any formal Agile process or methods.\nContrast this with the organizations that invest so much time and money into adopting Agile rituals, roles, methods, and processes, yet at the end of that expense and time, they are still releasing quarterly, and inflicting the associated pain on their customers.\nSimilarly, there is a spreading disease in the technology world where heavyweight processes masquerade as Agile, yet literally release only once a quarter.\nAnd just to be perfectly clear on this very critical point: if your company is still releasing yearly, quarterly, or even monthly, it doesn’t matter how many Agile rituals you follow, or how many so-called Agile coaches you may employ, the truth is that you are not Agile in any meaningful sense, you are not getting the necessary benefits, and you will not be able to serve your customers or your business as you need to.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/changing-how-you-build/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925811959,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Changing How You Decide Which Problems To Solve - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Jon Moore and Marty Cagan\nThis is the third of the three-article sequence diving into what is meant by meaningful transformation.\nSo far we’ve talked about the need to change how you build, and the need to change how you solve problems.  But we haven’t talked about how you decide which problems are the most important to solve.\nOUTCOME-BASED ROADMAPS\nIt is not hard to simply take your existing product roadmaps, and for each feature or project, to determine what the underlying problem to solve is, and what the logical way to measure success would be.  That’s the simple and straightforward way to move from roadmaps of features, to roadmaps of outcomes (this is referred to as an outcome-based roadmap).\nThis is not a difficult step, but simply providing your empowered product teams with problems to solve, and clear measures of success, can go a long way towards generating better solutions to those problems for your customers.\nBut are those really the most important problems to be solved for your customers and for your company?\nEvery company has before it a set of opportunities, and faces a set of threats.  \nBut how rigorous is your company in selecting the best opportunities to pursue, and focusing on the threats that you should take seriously?\nChanging how you decide which problems to solve is the third element of becoming a strong, product-led company.\nCUSTOMER-DRIVEN PRODUCT VISION\nSo many companies spend their time reacting – reacting to new sales opportunities, reacting to competitor’s offerings, reacting to customer requests, and reacting to price pressure.  Yet in strong product companies, while they care about these factors, they are not driven by them.\nWhat drives them is the pursuit of a product vision that can meaningfully improve the lives of their customers.\nIn fact, in a strong product company, a compelling and inspiring product vision is our single best tool for inspiring our product teams.  The people you want on your teams are precisely those that believe in your product vision.  They want to make a difference in the lives of your customers.\nA strong product vision will inspire an organization for many years (most are 3-10 year product visions).\nNote that the product vision is first and foremost about the customer.  How will it make the lives of your users and customers better?  \nIt is not about how you are going to make more money, or what your priorities should be for the quarter, or how you’ll structure your product teams. These other topics are important, but the purpose of the product vision is to describe the future that you are trying to create.  \nYou may have dozens or even hundreds of product teams, but the product vision is what unites the teams with the shared goal of making that vision a reality.\nINSIGHT-DRIVEN PRODUCT STRATEGY\nWhile the product vision describes the future, the product strategy is how we identify the most important problems to solve now.\nThe product strategy begins by focusing on the most critical areas for business success.  Most companies try to do too many things at once, and end up diluting their efforts and making too little progress on the true levers for the business.  \nAs Steve Jobs said, “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas.”\nOr, more simply: “If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.” – Russian Proverb\nOnce we have identified the few key focus areas, we then need to select the insights that we will be betting on.\nWe are constantly investigating the quantitative insights, mainly derived from the data that’s generated; and also the qualitative insights, mainly resulting from talking directly to our customers.  We’re also continuously evaluating the potential of new enabling technologies, and the implications of relevant industry and technology trends.\nThis type of insight-driven product strategy usually requires developing new muscles for the company, but the reward for strong product strategy is to get the most out of your technology investment.  Good product strategy is a force-multiplier.\nIt’s important to understand that product strategy is distinct from both business strategy and go-to-market strategy.  Many companies have strong skills in business strategy and/or go-to-market strategy, but product strategy is often missing completely.  \nIn fact, in most feature-team companies, the product strategy is literally to try to deliver as many features as possible for the different stakeholders.  Which is to say, there really isn’t a product strategy at all.\nTEAM OBJECTIVES\nThe product strategy identifies the most critical problems to solve in the quarter, and the product leaders assign those problems to the relevant product teams through team objectives.\nProduct teams are selected based on the areas they are responsible for, the skills on the team, the enabling technology used by that team, the data the team has access to, and the team’s ideas for pursuing this problem.\nThe product teams then work to discover a solution that solves the problem they’ve been assigned, and then they deliver that solution.\nTHE ROLE OF PRODUCT LEADERSHIP\nMost companies that want to transform understand that they need to dial up the level of their product teams.  Hiring more senior engineers.  Hiring skilled product designers.  Hiring competent product managers.\nBut many companies are surprised to learn that they often have even larger gaps in their product leadership.  \nIn fact, in many feature-team companies, they really don’t have any product leadership to speak of.  Since they rarely have a product vision, and are even less likely to have a product strategy, the job of product leadership is essentially new.\nMore generally, the product leaders play the primary role in coaching and developing their people to have the skills to effectively and successfully discover and deliver solutions.\nBut the leaders of product management, product design, and engineering are absolutely essential to not only changing how you decide which problems to solve, but also to changing how you solve problems and changing how you build.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/changing-how-you-decide-which-problems-to-solve/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925812005,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Changing How You Solve Problems - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Jon Moore and Marty Cagan\nThis is the second of a three-part sequence on defining transformation.\nChanging how you build, test and deploy is important no matter what you choose to build, but for too many companies, they just become a more efficient feature factory.  They ship more new features than ever, yet they don’t see the corresponding value to their customers, and impact to their business.\nIn fact, in most companies, the percentage of features and projects that are on your product roadmaps today that actually generate a positive return on investment is depressingly small.  Most industry analysts place it in the 10-20% range.\nIf you compare the list of capabilities that your company needs, with the impact that your newly released capabilities are generating, and if you are not feeling good about the return, then this is why changing how you solve problems is so important.\nThe root of the issue is that these feature teams are set up to serve the stakeholders in your business, rather than to serve your customers in ways that work for your business.\nThe business leaders and stakeholders each understand their specific needs, and they come up with a list of features and projects that they believe will help them deliver on their obligations to the business.  They hand these priorities down to the feature teams who are then asked to provide a product roadmap with dates and deliverables.\nSo why do so few of these features actually generate the hoped for return?\nRealize that each of these features is a potential solution to some underlying problem.  It might be a customer problem – maybe customers can’t figure out how to effectively use our product – or it might be a company problem – maybe it costs us too much for us to provision our product.\nIn the feature team model, the feature on the roadmap is designed by the designer on the feature team, and then built by the engineers on the feature team.  But the value and viability of the feature itself is the responsibility of whomever requested that feature on the roadmap.\nThis is why in the feature team model you can’t hold the feature team accountable to business results.  They are only there to produce output – the features.  If a feature doesn’t generate the desired outcome, they will simply point out the fact that this was not their job.\nNow it’s also very true that the stakeholder that decided on this feature will not likely want responsibility for the failure either.  They’ll almost certainly complain that the feature that was shipped was not what they had hoped it would be, or that it took longer to deliver than they had expected.  Which is why lack of trust between stakeholders and feature teams is such a common complaint.\nAnother serious consequence of this way of working is that we end up with a great many “orphaned” features – features that don’t produce real value, but are waiting for the day they might get another iteration, which rarely happens.  The result is very fast accumulation of technical debt, which can quickly get out of hand and end up dramatically slowing down the feature teams, or in some cases bringing the business to its knees.\nFor whatever reason, as soon as you lose your ability to consistently create value – to innovate on behalf of your customers – it is only a matter of time until your competitors are able to offer a more compelling solution to your customers.  This has happened to countless companies.  \nYou can reduce your prices, and you can run clever marketing and sales promotions, but these measures at best will just delay the inevitable.  Eventually someone else will serve your customers in ways that you no longer can.\nSOLVING PROBLEMS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR BUSINESS\nLet’s contrast this with an empowered product team.  In this case, rather than providing the product team with a roadmap of features and projects to build, the product team is instead given a set of problems to solve and desired outcomes to achieve.\nRather than simply implementing the features desired by the stakeholders, in an empowered product team, the product team is tasked with coming up with a solution that works for both the customer and for the business.\nThis means coming up with a solution that is valuable – the customer will buy or choose to use; usable – the user will be able to figure out how to use; feasible – our engineers know how to solve with the time, skills and technology on the team; and viable – the solution will work for our business in terms of constraints in marketing, sales, finance, service, legal and compliance.\nSo why is an empowered product team necessarily any better than feature teams?\nBesides the obvious reasons such as morale resulting from a much greater sense of ownership, and the knowledge gained in testing potential solutions directly with our users and customers, the major reason is because strong product companies understand that the single most important source of innovation is actually our engineers, and empowered product teams are designed to tap into this powerful asset.\nIn a feature team, the engineers are simply there to build what is requested.  They are effectively mercenaries.  Even worse, if you outsource your engineers they are quite literally mercenaries.  \nBut in an empowered product team, the engineers are not just there to build, they are also responsible for helping to identify the right solution.  This is what is meant by the term empowered engineer.\nThe advantage that the engineers have is that they are working with the enabling technology every single day, which puts them in the ideal position to see what’s just now possible.  \nWhen these empowered engineers are exposed directly to users and customers, you can start to see where nearly every innovative product or service you love originates from.\nAs Steve Jobs famously said, “we don’t hire all these engineers to tell them what to build; we hire them to show us what’s possible.”\nWhen combined with a strong product designer trained in the craft of designing effective and engaging user experiences, and a capable product manager trained in understanding both customers and the constraints of your business, you have the cross-functional set of skills necessary to solve hard problems in ways our customers love, yet work for our business.\nPRODUCT DISCOVERY AND REDUCING TIME-TO-MONEY\nFor an empowered product team held accountable to results rather than just shipping features, while time to market is still important, what is most important is time to money – in other words, the time to achieve the necessary outcome.\nIf an empowered product team ships a feature but does not see the necessary impact, then they iterate on that feature or on their approach until they do.\nWith this as the goal of the product team, the incentive moves to being able to quickly determine if a particular product idea or approach will work.  This is referred to as product discovery.\nThe product team could simply build their various ideas and see what works, but this would take much more time and essentially use our customers as guinea pigs.  Instead, the product team has a full battery of tools and techniques in order to quickly test out ideas and approaches.\nMostly the product team creates prototypes, which come in various forms but all are very fast and inexpensive to create, and each type designed to test different risks or assumptions.\nThe general rule of thumb is that any idea tested in product discovery should be at least one order of magnitude less expensive and faster than using the engineers to build, test and deploy an actual product.  In many cases, the prototypes are two orders of magnitude less than the product.\nIf, on average, it takes 3-5 iterations for a typical feature to reach the point where it generates the necessary business results, and if a feature team is being used to build each of these iterations, then we are often talking on the order of 1-2 years before a feature generates the desired returns, and that’s only in the rare case the stakeholders are willing to continue to put these necessary iterations on the product roadmap.\nIn contrast, if the empowered product team is assigned the problem to solve, and staffed with the skills needed to perform product discovery, then those 3-5 iterations can happen in 1-2 weeks, and the product version is in customer’s hands generating the necessary business results usually a few weeks after that.\nIf you’ve ever wondered how small, empowered product teams can so consistently out-produce much larger companies spending much more on their feature teams, this is right at the heart of the answer.\nTRUE COLLABORATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS TO SERVE CUSTOMERS\nBeyond saving money and time, the more important benefit of changing how you solve problems is that you are creating the mechanism to consistently create value for your customers.\nInstead of feature teams there to serve the stakeholders in your business, you now have empowered product teams designed to serve your customers, in ways that work for your business.\nThis difference is not minor, and changes the dynamics of your organization.  \nBut be warned:  \nSome key stakeholders will not be happy about losing control over the technology resources.  It is likely that many will resist passively, and some actively.  Which is why without the active support from the very top of the organization, transformations so often fail.\nAlso, some of your current product managers, product designers, and engineers may not be willing or able to take on this additional responsibility.  It is much harder to take responsibility for solving customer problems, than it is to just build the features you’re told.  You will need to ensure that you have staffed the right level of people on your product teams, and that they are provided with the necessary coaching for them to succeed.\nStrong, cross-functional, empowered product teams of product managers, product designers and engineers working together to solve customer problems in ways that our customers love, yet work for our business, is the essential core competency of a product-led company.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/changing-how-you-solve-problems/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925822243,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Chris Jones - Silicon Valley Product

The people we select will just need to get themselves to New York, and find themselves a place to stay.  \nAttendees won’t be asked to commit to anything.  They won’t be asked to pay for any form of certification, or any form of license fees, or royalties, or kickbacks of any sort. \nThey don’t even need to commit to passing along what they learn.  We know the onus is on us to convince the attendees that the techniques and methods are valuable.\nAs we’ve long argued, we don’t believe there is any single process or method behind strong companies.  We instead focus on the principles, the techniques and the mindset.\nSession FAQ\nWho will be invited to attend?\nWe have an application process that is open to anyone, and we are also encouraging those coaches and product leaders we already know and trust to refer people they think have the necessary potential.\nWe are looking for people with hands-on experience in product management, product design, engineering, and/or product leadership, that want to make a career out of helping others to reach their potential, and create world-class tech-powered products.\nPlease note that this is not a session for actual practitioners (e.g. the current head of product at a company) or for in-house company coaches.  This is for those people that help coach and teach many practitioners at many companies.\nWe will limit the attendees to 50 because we want to get to know each and every one of the people that attend personally.  This is also why we believe this is an important session to do in-person rather than virtually.\nWhat if I am a coach and trainer, but just for the people inside my own company?\nThis session is for those that are independent coaches, or those working at small consultancies. We had considered offering this session to internal product coaches on a “for fee” basis but have decided to have it remain for independent coaches that are helping multiple clients.  \nWhat if I am an Agile coach and trainer?\nBeing able to coach on Agile methods is fine, but this session is about coaching on product, so the experience we are looking for is experience with product discovery and normally that means several years of experience either as a product manager or a product designer.\nWhere do I show up for the session?\nWe will provide logistics info to those that are selected to attend.  The session itself will be in Manhattan, and will start at 9 am both days, and finish by 6 pm, but the discussions will likely continue informally into the evening.\nWhy are we doing this?\nWe hope to help enable attendees to provide coaching and training of the caliber necessary to create truly strong teams and companies, even for people that have not been fortunate enough to experience working at a strong product company.\nOur goal is to have many more coaches and trainers advocating the practices of the best companies, and we want to expand the set of people we consider qualified for us to refer companies to.  \nWhat if I’m based in the UK or EU, and I didn’t make it into the London session?\nWe appreciate your desire to attend, but this session is trying to identify and develop product coaches based in other locations. \nWhat if I’m currently the head of product at a product company, but I’m intending to leave soon to become an independent product coach?\nYou need to have already informed your current company of your plans to leave and change careers.  Please feel free to apply, and be sure to share your plans and reasons for your career change.\nWhat are the differences between the London and the NYC sessions?\nThe main difference of course is that the London session was for coaches based in the UK and EU, and the NYC session is for people based everywhere else.\nThe two parts of the London session that were considered most useful by the attendees were the sessions on “Successful Transformation” and also the session on “The Business of Coaching.”  Therefore, in this upcoming session, we’ve decided to focus on those two parts.\nWill we be able to use SVPG materials after this session?\nNo, that’s not the purpose or intention of this session.  Obviously we hope you’ll become an advocate for many of the ideas and principles that we also advocate, but only if you believe that is the right thing for your client.\nWill we receive some sort of certification from SVPG?\nNo, there is no certification, and we don’t believe in certifications in the product space.\nWill SVPG provide my firm any type of support or services after this session?\nWhile we are always happy to try to answer whatever product-related questions you or anyone in the product community has, beyond that, no, we are not set up to provide support to other people or firms.\nHow do I apply?\nYou can find the application here.  The deadline to apply is August 1, 2022.\nWhen will I know if I’ve been selected?\nWe will have selected and notified the attendees by September 1, 2022.\nContact info@svpg.com for any additional

Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn this article, I continue the series on coaching product managers by talking about another critically important skill that is so often misunderstood or under-appreciated, and that is collaboration.\nCollaboration is one of those words that is used so often in so many different ways that it has lost its meaning for many people.  Of course they are think they’re collaborative.  Few view themselves as anti-collaborative.\nBut in the context of an empowered, cross-functional product team, being collaborative has a very specific meaning, and it is most definitely not how many people, especially product managers, are inclined to work.  So this is often a critically important area for the manager to focus on during coaching.\nIn the article Beyond Lean and Agile I talk about the three critical characteristics of strong product teams, no matter what processes they use, and the second one is that strong product teams solve problems collaboratively.\nIn particular, it is no longer the old waterfall process of a product manager defining requirements, and handing them off to a designer to come up with a design that meets those requirements, and then handing that off to engineers to implement the design.\nSo what do we really mean by collaboration?\nLet’s start by talking about what collaboration is not.\nFirst, collaboration is not about consensus.  I’ve written earlier how important it is not to confuse collaboration with consensus.  While we like it when the product team is in agreement on the best course of action, we do not insist on this.  Similarly, collaboration is not about democracy.  Rather, we depend on the expertise of each member of the product team.  Generally speaking, if the tech lead feels a specific architecture is called for, we defer to the tech lead.  If the designer feels a specific user experience is called for, we defer to the designer.  Occasionally there will be conflicts and judgement calls, and normally we’ll run a test to resolve.\nSecond, collaboration is not about artifacts.  Many product managers think their job is to produce some form of document capturing “requirements,” or at the least, they are there to write user stories.  It is true that sometimes we need to create artifacts (especially when team members are remote), but that is certainly not how we collaborate.  In fact, these artifacts more often get in the way of actual collaboration.\nWhy is that?  Because once the product manager has claimed something is a “requirement” it pretty much ends the conversation, and moves the discussion into implementation.  At this point the designer feels like she’s there to ensure the design conforms to the company style guide, and the engineers feel like they are there just to code, and we’re back to waterfall.\nThird, collaboration is also not about compromise.  If you end up with a mediocre user experience, and slow performance and limited scalability, and dubious value for customers, as a team you lose.\nWe need to find a solution that works.   By that we mean that it is valuable (valuable enough that target customers will actually buy it or choose to use it); it is usable (so users can actually experience that value), it is feasible (so we can actually deliver that value) and it is viable for our business (so the rest of our company can effectively market, sell, and support the solution).\nAs we’ve discussed extensively elsewhere, in order to do this, we need to know what we can’t know, and admit what we don’t know, and focus on discovering a solution that works.\nAnd that requires true collaboration.\nRemember that our job in product is to solve the problems we are asked to solve, in ways that our customers love, yet that work for our business.  That’s our job as a cross-functional product team, and each member of the team is there because they bring necessary skills.\nThis all starts with true and intense collaboration with your design and engineering teammates.\nMy favorite way to actually do this is to sit around a prototype (usually created by the designer) so as a team you can consider and discuss the proposed solution on the table, and the designer can consider different approaches to the experience, and the engineers can consider implications of different approaches and the potential of different enabling technologies, and the product manager can consider the impacts and consequences of each potential direction (e.g. would there be privacy violations, or would this be something that would work with our sales channel?).\nNote that while doing product discovery, certain tools and techniques serve both to facilitate collaboration, as well as to provide an artifact as an output of that collaboration.  Two very popular examples of that are prototypes and story maps.  The very act of creating and discussing prototypes and story maps facilitates true collaboration.  And if you are diligent about keeping your prototype or story map up to date, then they can also serve as an artifact capturing the learning and decisions from the discovery work.  The real benefit and purpose of the tools in this case is in fostering the collaboration, however, it is a nice side-benefit to be able to have an artifact at the end.\nNotice that the product manager and engineers aren’t trying to tell the designer how to her job.  And the product manager and designers are not there to tell the engineers how to do their jobs.  And the designers and engineers aren’t there to tell the product manager how to do her job.\nRather, in a healthy and competent team, each member of the team is counting on the others to have done their homework and bring the necessary skills to the table.\nBut please don’t misunderstand this as designers are only responsible for usability, and engineers are only responsible for feasibility, because this would miss the real point of collaboration.\nDesigners often have insights based on deep understanding of our users and their behaviors that lead us in a different direction in terms of the problem we’re solving, or our approach to the problem.  These insights will often have big impact on value, and indirect impacts on things like performance.\nSimilarly, strong engineers have deep insights into the enabling technology that often leads us to entirely different solutions to the problems we were assigned, often much better than anything the product manager, the designer or especially the customer could have imagined.\nIf I had to pick the one thing I love the most about the feeling of true collaboration on an empowered product team, it is the form of magic that happens when you have people that are a) motivated and b) skilled in their respective discipline – product, design and engineering – and they sit around a prototype or watch a user interact with our prototype, and the engineer points out new possibilities, and the designer points out different potential experiences, and the product manager weighs in with the sales or financial or privacy related implications, and after exploring a bunch of approaches, they find one that actually works – it’s valuable, it’s usable, it’s feasible and it’s viable.\nIn my experience, there are two situations where this most often goes wrong.\nThe first is that the product manager has not done her homework and she doesn’t know the various aspects and constraints of the business – sales, marketing, finance, legal, privacy, etc. – so the product team really doesn’t have the information it needs to solve the problems it has been assigned (which usually means they’re back to implementing features on a roadmap).  That’s why we discussed early in this series on coaching that as a manager your first priority is to assess the product manager and create a plan to get her to competence.\nThe second is arrogance.  If the product manager believes the solution she already has in mind is clearly the best, even if she is right, collaboration is stifled, and she probably now has a team of mercenaries rather than missionaries.\nWhile it’s true that the majority of the actual collaboration for a product manager is happening with her designer and engineers, there are several other examples where we need true collaboration as well.\nA healthy relationship with stakeholders is one based on true collaboration.  The product manager is not there to “gather requirements” from stakeholders, but the product manager is also not there to dictate solutions to stakeholders.  Rather, the strong product manager understands that each stakeholder is responsible for some key aspect of the business, and they are a key partner in helping to come up with a solution that works.\nA common and clear example of this is that often what we are trying to do has legal implications, maybe around privacy or maybe around regulatory compliance.  The legal stakeholder is your partner on understanding these constraints, and helping to evaluate the suitability of various approaches.\nAgain, a constructive, collaborative relationship with stakeholders is predicated on the product manager having done her homework so she can be that effective partner with the stakeholder and not just some form of facilitator or project manager.\nEverything I said above is doubly important when we’re talking about collaborating with company executives.  In general, the more senior in the organization, they more the executives care about everything – customers, brand, revenue, compliance – and the more important it is for the product manager to have done her homework.\nCollaborating with stakeholders and executives involves listening carefully to try to understand the constraints, and thinking hard about solutions that would work for our customers and our business.\nAnother important form of collaboration, especially in companies with a direct sales force, is engaging with prospective customers to determine if your product can meet their needs.  It is natural for the prospect to try to dictate requirements for features, but your job is to work to understand their underlying issues and constraints, and then work collaboratively with your prospective customers to determine if there’s a general solution that will meet their needs.  This form of collaboration is at the heart of the customer discovery program technique.\nCollaboration means working together with our designers and engineers, stakeholders and executives to come up with a solution that solves for all of our constraints – this is what we mean by solutions that our customers love, yet work for our business.\nGetting good at true collaboration is at the heart of how strong product managers work.  It’s a combination of skills and mindset, and it often takes active coaching by the manager to help the new product manager develop this capability.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/coaching-collaboration/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925897910,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Coaching - Ethics - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn this final article on the series on coaching, I’d like to discuss one of the most sensitive, yet potentially most important topics, and that is the subject of ethics.\nAs readers of these articles know, the four big risks that every product team needs to consider are:\nWill the customer buy it, or will the user choose to use it? (value risk)\nCan the user figure out how to use it? (usability risk)\nCan we build it? (feasibility risk)\nCan the stakeholders support this solution? (business viability risk)\nNormally we would consider ethical questions as part of business viability.  If a solution is not ethical, it may indeed leave the company in serious trouble.\nHowever, in practice there are two problems with this:\nFirst, there are already so many different aspects to business viability – sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, privacy and more – that it’s easy for ethics to get lost.  \nSecond, unlike the other areas of business viability, there is rarely a stakeholder explicitly responsible for ethics.  \nThe result is that ethics too often does not get the attention it deserves, and we have all seen the damage to the company, to the environment, to our customers, and to society that can result from ethical lapses.\nSo, I have been advocating explicitly considering the ethical implications, by adding a fifth risk:\nShould we build it? (ethical risk)\nOne progressive tech-product company that does have a stakeholder specifically responsible for ethics is Airbnb, where my long-time friend Rob Chesnut serves as Chief Ethics Officer.\nRob trained as a lawyer and began his career as a federal prosecutor, and then joined a young eBay as it’s legal counsel, which is where I first met him.  He has gone on to have a terrific career working for and advising a range of leading tech companies, most recently at Airbnb.\nRob has worked in the heart of Silicon Valley for decades and has seen what happens when companies don’t pay enough attention to ethics.  Rob explains, “Leaders need to recognize that there’s a sea change in the world, where companies and their leaders are increasingly going to be held accountable for ethical failures.”\nThere’s no question that tech is now big business, and is subject to many of the same pressures that have long challenged big public companies.  Rob explains, “In the past, companies had one stakeholder — the shareholder.  Do what’s good for the bottom line. That’s an approach that has led a lot of companies to think about everything in the short term, hitting the quarterly number.  And it’s also incented a lot of behavior that is increasingly being recognized as unethical, and causing more and more people to lose faith in companies. Hit the number, and don’t worry about whether what you’re building is really good for your customers, or the environment, or your partners, or the world at large.”\n“It’s important for companies to recognize other stakeholders, and understand the implications that each product solution will have on those stakeholders.  At Airbnb, for example, we not only consider the interests of our investors, but of other important stakeholders — our employees, our guests, our hosts and the communities where we do business.  If we consistently make decisions that negatively impact one or more of those stakeholders, we know that we’re failing in our mission and, over the long term, hurting our business.”\nHow does ethics apply to me in my job?\nEthics applies to every member of the company, but it’s also true that product managers are on the leading edge where new products and services are conceived, developed and deployed.  So we have a special responsibility to consider the implications of our work.\nAs Rob explains: “Good product managers need to understand the implications of the solutions they’re designing not just on revenues, but on that broader stakeholder community.   Signals to watch for: Will the product solution be good for the end-customer? Does it have a negative impact on the environment in some way, or third parties in the community?  Is it something that, if all of the emails and documents and discussions around the product were published online, you’d be embarrassed? How would government regulators react if they knew everything?  Will the product be something that you will be proud of as part of your personal brand?”\nAs leaders coach their product managers, these are the types of questions we need to be discussing.  More generally, it’s important for us to get this topic out on the table. “You want a company where everyone is comfortable asking the uncomfortable questions; that helps protect your company against disastrous ethical failures.”\nSo what do you do if you identify an ethical issue?\nOne of the toughest situations for a product manager is when they spot a brewing ethical issue, but they’re not sure how they should handle the situation.  Clearly this is going to be sensitive, and potentially emotional. Our best answer is to discover a solution that does not have these ethical concerns, but in some cases you won’t be able to, or may not have the time.\nRob’s advice is: “Speak up in a thoughtful way, raise your concerns, but not in a holier than thou nor accusatory way.  Try to explain in a way that makes it clear that you care about protecting the best interests of the company.”\nI have found that it’s essential that you have a deep understanding of how your business works so that you’re not perceived as naive or ignorant about the economics.  This is also a situation where you may need the help of your manager.\nSo what do you do if you are working at a company that you believe is fundamentally not interested in ethics?\nI rarely encourage people to leave their company, however, when it comes to those companies that are clearly ignoring the ethical implications of their work, I have and will continue to encourage people to leave.\nRob’s response is “if you’re not proud of where you work, not proud of how your company is impacting the world, or believe that leadership really doesn’t care about integrity, it’s probably time to start looking for another job.”\nFortunately, in my experience, the vast majority of tech companies do care about ethics and they are genuinely trying to help improve the world in some meaningful way.  But even good intentions can have unintended consequences. As a manager, it’s become increasingly important to coach your product managers on this topic of ethics, starting with getting them to explicitly consider the question of whether we should build something.\nFor those that would like to learn more about this important topic, Rob has a new book coming out this summer called Intentional Integrity: How Smart Companies Can Lead an Ethical Revolution.  The book is currently available for pre-order.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/coaching-ethics/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925919833,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Coaching the Coaches - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNote:  This article is an announcement for one of two Coach the Coaches workshops that SVPG conducted in 2022.  There are no new sessions planned at this time.\nThis is a special note.  It is intended for those people that have dedicated themselves to coaching, training and developing other product people, or may be considering making a career out of this type of work.\nSome of us have been fortunate to have met a truly gifted coach.  Someone that genuinely cares about you and your career, but that also has a deep understanding of the nature of product.  Someone that understands that it’s not about following some process, but rather about doing the daily work of discovery and delivery.  Someone truly dedicated to help you reach your potential.\nWe are looking for those people.  But not to hire.  Just to help them help others.  If you know such a person, we’re hoping you will forward this note along to them.\nAt the moment, we’re looking for people that are based in the UK and EU, and we have an unusual proposition for them, which you can see described below:\nAn Open Invitation to the Global Product Coaching and Training Community\nI’ve written many times about the difference between how the best companies work and how most companies work, and while I acknowledge that the majority of companies are not working like the best companies, my SVPG partners and I focus our efforts on doing what we can to help more companies learn to operate like the best.\nBut there’s little doubt in my mind that we are losing that battle, especially globally.  The global rise of SAFe is proof enough.\nAnother harsh fact is that we realize we have no chance of doing this alone.  \nSVPG is just a few partners, and while we know this is a good problem to have, we have very limited supply compared to the demand, which means that for the majority of companies that reach out to us, we can’t help in any reasonable amount of time.\nWe do have a small set of people around the world that we frequently recommend.  These are people we know and trust, and we know are strong.  But we have long ago overwhelmed these people.\nHowever, we also believe there are many others out there that we don’t yet know, but we’d like to.  People that are already strong product coaches, and people that have the ingredients to be strong coaches, but maybe haven’t had the good fortune yet to learn how the best companies work.\nSo in order to try to reach and help more people and more companies, we want to try something very different, and that’s what I want to announce in this note.\nOn May 24-26, in London, SVPG will be hosting an intensive, immersive, 3-day session, open to product and discovery coaches and trainers from across the UK and EU. \nIf this goes well, we plan to do the same in other major regions of the world.\nMost important, there will be absolutely no charge for this session, and there are absolutely no strings attached. \nThe people we select will just need to get themselves to London, and find themselves a place to stay.  \nAttendees won’t be asked to commit to anything.  They won’t be asked to pay for any form of certification, or any form of license fees, or royalties, or kickbacks of any sort. \nThey don’t even need to commit to passing along what they learn.  \nWe know the onus is on us to convince the attendees that the techniques and methods are valuable.\nAs we’ve long argued, we don’t believe there is any single process or method behind strong companies.  We instead focus on the principles, the techniques and the mindset.\nSession FAQ\nWho can attend?\nWe have an application process that is open to anyone based in the UK/EU region, and we are also encouraging those coaches and product leaders we do know and trust, to refer people they think have the necessary potential.\nWe are looking for people with experience in product management, product design, engineering, and/or product leadership, that want to make a career out of helping others to reach their potential, and create world-class tech-powered products.\nPlease note that this is not a session for actual practitioners (e.g. the current head of product at a company) or for in-house company coaches.  This is for those people that help coach and teach many practitioners at many companies.\nWe will limit the attendees to 50 because we want to get to know each and every one of the people that attend personally.  This is also why we believe this is an important session to do in-person rather than virtually.\nHow do I apply?\nJust click here to access the application.\nWhat is the deadline to apply?\nGet your applications submitted by Feb 28.\nWhen will I know if I’ve been selected?\nWe will have selected and notified the attendees by March 31.\nWhere do I show up for the session?\nWe will provide logistics info to those that are selected to attend.  The session itself will be in Central London, and will start at 9 am all three days, and finish by 6 pm, but the discussions will likely move from the venue to a local pub.\nWhat if I am a coach and trainer, but just for the people inside my own company?\nUnfortunately this session is for those that are independent coaches, or those working at small consultancies. We might do a version of this in the future for in-house/corporate trainers, but that would be a for-fee session. \nWhy are we doing this?\nWe hope to help enable attendees to provide coaching and training of the caliber necessary to create truly strong teams and companies, even for people that have not been fortunate enough to experience working at a strong product company.\nOur goal is to have many more coaches and trainers advocating the practices of the best companies, and we want to expand the set of people we consider qualified for us to refer companies to.  \nWhat if I’m based in another part of the world, but I am willing to travel to London for this?\nWe appreciate your willingness to travel to attend, but this session is trying to develop coaches based in the UK and EU.  If you do apply, we will save your application for if and when we hold a session in your part of the world.\nWhat if I’m currently the head of product at a product company, but I’m intending to leave soon to become an independent product coach?\nYou must have already notified your current company of your plans to leave and change careers.  If this is the case, please feel free to apply, and be sure to share your plans and reasons for your career change.\nWill we be able to use SVPG materials after this session?\nNo, that’s not the purpose or intention of this session.  Obviously we hope you’ll become an advocate for many of the ideas and principles that we also advocate, but only if you believe that is the right thing for your client.\nWill we receive some sort of certification from SVPG?\nNo, there is no certification, and we don’t believe in certifications in the product space.\nWill SVPG provide my firm any type of support or services after this session?\nWhile we are always happy to try to answer whatever product-related questions you or anyone in the product community has, beyond that, no, we are not set up to provide support to other people or firms.\nHow loosely are you defining the European region?  Does this include countries like Israel and UAE?\nYes, this session is for the broadly defined European region.\nWill you be hosting future sessions like this in other major European cities?\nNo, our intention is to do this once in each major region of the world, and for Europe, we selected London as the venue.\nWhat if I have a question not covered here?\nJust send your question to info@svpg.com.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/coaching-the-coaches/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925936403,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Coaching vs. Mentoring - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tTo continue on with the coaching series, one question that frequently comes up is the difference between coaching and mentoring?  Is there even a meaningful difference?\nI don’t know if there’s any definitive authority on these terms, but many years ago I was taught the Bill Campbell view on this question, and I have used his distinction in my own work.\nFirst, it’s important to point out that both coaching and mentoring are good.  The world would be better if we had much more of each.\nI try to mentor as many people as I can that want it, although long ago I realized that I needed to focus my efforts on one-to-many techniques.  Initially I would agree to meet for an hour, over a coffee, once a month with essentially anyone that asked, especially if they were from an underrepresented group.  But it didn’t take long before the number of these requests started to get out of hand.  But by then I had already started to notice that many of the same themes kept coming up, both with my own direct reports, and with those I was mentoring.  So I started working on one-to-many mentoring activities that were higher leverage. Writing these articles is a prime example.  Same with the books.  Giving community talks.  AMA sessions.  Teaching some public workshops.\nHowever, I only coach a select few people at a time, which in my case is done through my advisory work.  This coaching is generally one-to-one, so it is much more time-intensive, but also much more personal.\nBut here is the key.  When I mentor, I try to share my honest opinions and reasoning, but I know that I have no control over whether the person listens, or whether that advice even applies in their particular circumstances.  So I don’t lose any sleep over how this works out for each person.\nBut with coaching, I know that if the person I’m coaching ends up failing, that’s very much on me.  As a coach, I’m signing up to ensure that person is prepared for the tasks at hand, and it’s my reputation on the line as well.  So I do stress about whether their particular product strategy is solid, or whether the person is prepared for an upcoming executive review or a board meeting.  Just as their manager should.  As Bill Campbell said, “You can’t be a good manager without being a good coach.”\nBottom line is that as a coach I have some real degree of accountability.  As a mentor, I don’t.  But again, I consider both helpful.\nAs the years go by, I find coaching and mentoring to be rewarding in ways even beyond how much I love actually building products.\nI recently read a very inspiring article by Arthur Brooks that deeply resonated with me, and I realized that I’m not the only one that has discovered this.  \nNow I also realize there’s probably some confirmation bias going on here, as the subtitle of the article is “America needs more than innovation; it needs wisdom” and that’s something that I also believe.\nMost people are all too aware of the downsides of aging.  But this article highlighted one of the upsides. I would encourage everyone in the tech industry, of any age, to read and consider this article.  \nMy only caveat is that while I do believe in the core argument of this article, I have known quite a few exceptions in my career – of very young people showing extraordinary insights and wisdom, and of course older people that remain completely clueless.\nBut if you have had a good career and been fortunate enough to have contributed to some great products, it’s encouraging to see how you can continue to contribute in new and in many ways, deeper levels.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/coaching-vs-mentoring/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925838600,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Consumer Internet Services - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn the last issue I wrote about the role that domain expertise plays in product management, and I alluded to deeper differences in types of products. For more traditional types of products, such as Enterprise Software, these differences are fairly well-known. But for consumer internet services, this is new enough that I thought I’d share some of the most important lessons that I’ve learned from doing large-scale internet services at Netscape, AOL and eBay, and working with clients at several other major internet service companies.\nI should say up front that I love building very large-scale consumer services. Creating products that are used and appreciated by millions of people around the world is an amazing thing. And unlike most types of products, there’s nothing between you and your customer – no sales force or distribution channels to work through – you can reach your user base easily and instantly, and try ideas out in near real-time. You know right away if people love or hate your new ideas.\nBut it’s also very hard.\nSometimes the hardest problems of all come when you actually manage to create a great product and people love it and word starts to spread – I call this situation “surviving success.” eBay came very close to collapsing in 1999; far closer than most people realized. More recently, Friendster got off to a great start but has stumbled badly and it’s not clear if they’ll recover or not (I hope they do, I think they have the ingredients for a great service).\nBelow is a list of ten techniques that are especially important for large-scale consumer internet service companies. It’s a general list, meant to apply to many types of services including e-commerce, social networks, search engines, and games, as just a few examples.\n1. Usability – In my opinion, most companies give far too little attention to this in every type of product (especially enterprise software!) but with a consumer internet service there simply is no getting around that it’s really all about the user experience, and if you can’t find a way to make your service something that the target user can figure out how to use and why they should use it, then you’re going nowhere fast. Also remember that performance is a key factor in usability. If a page takes to long to load, people will think it’s broken or just go elsewhere because the experience is bad.\n2. User Profiling – When you have millions of users, there is no “user” but rather you have at least several important types of users. It’s critical that you segment your users into the most important profiles and consider each one separately. When you create a feature, you need to examine how each user profile will value and respond to that feature.\n3. Scalability – Weird things happen to products once millions of users start using them. Databases break, performance bottlenecks pop up all over, user interfaces become unusable. You can do some amount of load testing during QA, but I’ve found this only finds the easy problems. I guarantee you that you’ll have surprises, and not pleasant ones. Managing the scalability needs takes a collaboration of product management, design, engineering, and operations. It also takes a proactive management team that allocates a significant amount of engineering and operations resources on an ongoing basis (I generally advise 20-30%) to scaling the product and infrastructure. If you get to the point where everything breaks and the engineering team is telling you that the “house of cards has collapsed” you’re in big trouble. The only way I know to avoid that is to “pay your taxes” by working on scale continuously from day one, and don’t let yourself get to the brink.\n4. Availability – Very quickly you find that there really is no time of the day or week or month or year that your service doesn’t need to be running. I don’t know of anyone that has achieved 100% availability, but I know outages are painful to everyone. The life of a consumer internet service provider is not for everyone. Things happen at all hours, weekday and weekends, and everyone I know in the business has their stories. You need to design in high-availability to all of your thinking just as you need to do with scalability.\n5. Customer Support – One of the biggest (and least fun) surprises that most consumer service companies run into is customer support. Traditional models of customer support can quickly bankrupt even the best services companies. This is oversimplifying a complicated topic, but you have no alternative but to design and build the product to absolutely minimize customer support costs, especially if you charge a fee for your service. Yet always remember that it is not about controlling customer support costs, it is about ensuring a great customer experience.\n6. Privacy and Data Protection – Consumer internet service companies can very quickly end up with far more personal information than they ever imagined. You may be collecting this data for purely innocent purposes, such as to provide a personalized user experience. But today customer data like e-mail addresses and credit card numbers is a very sensitive asset, and you don’t want the press and possible penalties and especially customer anger that results if that data gets into the wrong hands. You need to put the protections in place early to absolutely ensure that you are protecting the information that your customers entrusted you with. And as the recent AOL criminal case illustrates, you also need to protect the actual user data from your own employees.\n7. Viral Marketing – If your product is good, your users will want to share that experience with their friends, family and co-workers. That’s absolutely what you want, but it’s surprising to me how few companies actually do anything to facilitate this most powerful form of marketing. Consider what you can do in your product to enable users to invite their friends to try it. Also, work the numbers. Most companies are willing to pay a certain amount per new user (customer acquisition cost, usually for marketing and advertising). Maybe you can funnel some of that money to your users instead? But even without financial incentives, find ways to make “sharing the love” easy.\n8. Globalization – If you have a good service, you’ll find that it will quickly spread beyond your country’s borders, first to other countries that speak the same language, then to the rest of the major internet-connected countries. It is far less expensive – and overall faster to market – to design a product that can easily be localized than it is to try and take a product for one country/currency/language/culture and rewrite it for another. You don’t have to localize initially for all the countries, but as your business spreads you can much more rapidly and economically meet your new users’ needs.\n9. Gentle Deployment – When millions of people are using your service, any change is a big deal, and every change needs to be considered carefully. I’ve written elsewhere on “Gentle Deployment Strategies” but suffice it to say here that changes need to be deployed intelligently. This doesn’t just mean great QA. It also means deploying gradually, and giving your users time to switch when they have the time to learn about the changes, not when you happen to roll it out. In many cases, this means deploying the new version alongside the old so that people can switch over a period of time. Also, do everything you can to eliminate gratuitous changes. It’s hard enough for your community to absorb features that they know they want and need.\n10. Community Management – Every company is dependent on its customers, but for consumer internet service companies, this community of users takes on even more powerful importance. They can make you or break you. It has never been easier for them to communicate how much they love your product – or how badly you just treated them. If your users value your product, they will want to be loyal, and they will want to be a part of the great community you are creating, but they also want to be appreciated and recognized, and not just with lip-service. There are many ways to reach out to your community – to learn from them and understand where they want to see your product go. There are also many ways to show your gratitude to the community and to recognize those that make especially valuable contributions. Do this, and make community awareness a top priority for everyone in your company, from the CEO on down.\nIf you can keep these 10 techniques in mind as you create your consumer internet services, you’ll save yourself a lot of grief. But as I said above, these are great products to work on, and it’s easy to become hooked on these types of businesses.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/consumer-internet-services/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925878166,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Content: Product Articles","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tJune 1, 2005\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tYouth versus Experience\n\t\n\tIf you have been wondering what’s going on with all these startups with 20-something founders and product leaders, you’re not...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tFebruary 28, 2011\n\tMartina Lauchengco\n\t\n\t\n\tWhy Traditional Messaging Fails\n\t\n\tBack when I was a product manager for Microsoft Office, we spent hundreds of thousands on positioning research.

Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThere is a very common fallacy about developers in our industry, and I think it hurts countless companies.\nHave you ever heard the old accusation that developers only want to solve problems for themselves?  They’ll spend countless hours, often on their own time, to create amazing tools for themselves and the developers they work with.  But just try to get them excited about building something for “the business” or “the customer” and good luck.\nI’ve been accused of this myself.  For the first 20 years of my career I was either building tools for other developers, or leading products designed for other developers.  It wasn’t actually until eBay that I was responsible for creating products for people other than developers.\nI have been increasingly vocal lately about the critical role that developers must play in consistent innovation.  I’ve been raising the volume on this because despite what I consider overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I continue to find teams where the CEO, the product managers, and the designers think they can figure out the product themselves, and they don’t want to “bother” the engineers with anything that distracts from their coding time.\nI’ve written about this several times before but while my writing talks about the critical need to include developers, it has not addressed this belief that developers only want to solve problems for other developers.\nDon’t get me wrong, it’s easy to see where this misconception comes from.  Developers get hugely excited about building things for other developers, and progress on the engineering tooling front has been near constant because of that (consider DevOps as just the latest example).  So it’s easy to see why people think this is all that can excite developers.\nWhile it’s easy to understand where this opinion comes from, I argue it is dead wrong.\nHere’s the key:\nIt’s not that developers only want to build products for themselves.  The vast majority of developers are passionate about solving real problems for real people.  The problem is that in the vast majority of companies, the only people that the developers are actually exposed to directly on a regular basis are other developers.  They see the problems their colleagues are dealing with, and they want to help.\nHowever, how often do you see the developers brought along to the actual customers?\nI have long said that “the magic happens” when you connect the developers with the actual users and customers, and let them witness – first hand – the good, the bad and the ugly.\nWhen a company keeps their developers sheltered from their customers, they are hurting themselves and their customers.\nOne of the worst things you can do is try to shelter the developers from the ugly truth.  Give them the chance to see the issues themselves, and I am betting you will see a level of motivation and passion around solving the problems that you may not have realized possible.\nNote that we don’t need every developer to engage with customers, but we do need some.  It’s usually the more senior developers.\nOne last warning about this.  While it’s essential to get developers out there interacting directly with your users and customers, you do need to make sure that they know the proper etiquette (for lack of a better word), especially if you have a direct sales organization.  It’s not unusual to have some form of “charm school” for the developers.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/developer-powered-innovation/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925911000,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery - Delivery - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tTo continue with the series on common confusions regarding product discovery, in this article I want to tackle a very damaging anti-pattern that can sometimes arise where the product team essentially devolves into two different teams, where one team is doing product discovery (aka “discovery team”), and another team is doing product delivery (aka “delivery team”).\nOf course, I would hope anyone that follows anything that I’ve written, or really any modern product practices, knows that this is not how you want to work, and we just have a single, cross-functional product team, responsible for both discovery and delivery.\nThis is key for both empowerment and for innovation.\nNormally, each product team performs these two core activities, discovery and delivery, continuously.\nCertainly, at any given point in time, different people on the product team may be focused on discovery activities or delivery activities, and obviously the product manager and product designer spend most of their time on discovery, and the engineers spend most of their time on delivery.  But if you care about empowerment and innovation you will want to make sure that each member of the product team is engaged in both activities.  It really doesn’t take much time at all for engineers to stay engaged with the ongoing discovery work.\nMost people I meet already get this, but I do occasionally meet a team, or read some article, or see some tweet, where it’s clear the person has this very basic misunderstanding.\nThere are a few common manifestations of this problem:\nThe first is where the product manager believes it’s her job to define the product, and then hand-off “the requirements” to the designer and engineers to implement.  Pretty much all pure delivery teams work this way, and most feature teams do too, although it may also be someone further upstream (e.g. a stakeholder or business owner) that is the one defining the solutions.\nAnother especially egregious example is if the company outsources their engineering to an agency or contractors.\nFundamentally we want to avoid having one person or group obtain the learnings, and then have to “hand-off” what they learned for another group to execute on.  The group on the receiving end is inevitably going to feel like mercenaries, and not feel like their contributions on better potential solutions would be welcomed.\nIt’s the same reason that corporate innovation labs have such a poor record of delivering results.\nIt’s worth acknowledging that sometimes the people making the decisions and deciding what the solution should be may be very strong, such as a company founder or very experienced head of product.  But there will still be a very high price paid in terms of motivation, and lack of ownership of the results, by the people on the receiving end, not to mention the substantially reduced likelihood of innovation.\nAnd over time, the people on the receiving end will self-select to those willing to work like this, and that’s when I meet founders or product leaders that complain to me about the lack of skill, initiative or ownership from the people on their teams.\nSo if you’re working to create strong empowered product teams, be sure that each of your cross-functional product teams understands that they are responsible for both discovery and delivery work, and they are responsible for coming up with effective solutions and achieving the necessary results.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-delivery/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925909820,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery - Excuses - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn this article I’d like to continue with the series on common problems with product discovery.\nSo far I’ve talked about the difference between learnings and insights, the differences that result from focusing on the problem versus the solution, the essential role of judgement, and balancing discovery and delivery activities.\nThose that know me personally know that I spend a lot of my time helping to persuade company leaders to start trusting and empowering their product teams.\nHowever, in more than a few companies, the issue is not so much with the company’s leaders, it’s with the product teams themselves.  In these cases, I often hear excuses for why they think they can’t do their product discovery work.\nIn this article, I’d like to share the most common excuses I hear, and how I respond:\n“There’s No Demand”\nI see this confusion so often, and I’ve written about this before:\nIt’s worth noting that if you have a crappy solution, it can look to you like the demand isn’t there.  You know you can’t sell it, and it’s tempting to blame this on demand, but this is rarely a sign that the problem isn’t real; it’s much more often a sign that your solution is not perceived by the customers as better than the alternatives, and certainly not better enough to persuade the customer to switch.\nNow sometimes it’s true that there’s just not demand, but much more often than not, it is easier on our ego to believe the demand isn’t there, at least until a competitor comes along with a dramatically better solution, which makes clear the issue was never demand.\n“Our Customers Hate Change”\nIf only I had a nickel for every time I’ve heard this one.  Especially from teams doing products for Enterprise companies.\nCustomers hate bad products.  And they don’t appreciate gratuitous change.  But customers happily change all the time – if you give them something that truly makes their lives better.\nAs with “there’s no demand,” it’s a convenient excuse to blame your customers for not wanting to change, until a competitor comes along with something dramatically better, and then all of the sudden your customer is no longer yours.\nSlack. Stripe. Shopify. Tesla. Zoom. Netflix. iPhone. Workiva…\n“We’re In A Regulated Industry”\nFor those that can’t blame their customers, it’s convenient to blame their industry.  Many industries are regulated – financial, healthcare, telcos, transportation, power, environmental – are all obvious examples.\nBut most industries have more regulation than you might think.  Consider the various employment regulations that Uber and Lyft have to accommodate.  Or the various zoning regulations that Airbnb has to accommodate.  Or the age and privacy related regulations that most gaming companies need to accommodate.\nAnd every company, to one degree or another, is constrained by legal regulations.\nThe point is that every company has to come up with solutions that comply with the relevant constraints.  I’ve said many times that coming up with a solution that users and customers love is only half the battle – we also need to make sure the solution works for our business (viability).\nYes, some industries have more constraints than others, which makes the problems tougher to solve, but those same constraints increase the barriers to entry for your would-be competitors.\nIn any case, we have very good discovery techniques for dealing with regulated industries.\nI’ve loved watching the new breed of strong product companies disrupting financial services and healthcare especially.\n“We Have A New Type of Product”\nIt’s remarkable to me how many startup founders and product managers think that they can’t test out their product ideas because it’s a new type of product.\nUsually what’s going on is that they are misunderstanding the first principle of product, which is that our customers can’t tell us what to build.  But I point out to them we’re not asking them to tell us what to build.  We’re testing to see if they will buy the product if we do build it.\nWhether it’s truly a new type of product (rarely) or just a different approach to the solution (almost always), eventually you are going to have to put it in front of real users and customers.  You’re not doing yourself any favors by giving yourself reasons to push that day off.\n“We’re Not Allowed To Talk to Customers”\nThis excuse is usually only found with organizations that depend on a direct sales force, where the head of sales has very strong convictions about account control, and usually also has some scars from rogue product managers and engineers having messed things up for them in the past.\nIn any case, it’s important to respect the role of sales in a direct sales go-to-market model, but that doesn’t mean we don’t need to talk to customers.  That’s non-negotiable.  What is negotiable is how we do this.\nUsually what’s required is the head of product and the head of sales have a conversation about the concerns and how they’ll be addressed.  That’s the purpose of charm school for product people.\nIf despite all attempts you’re still prevented from talking to customers, then you probably want to reconsider your company’s chances at sustained success.\n“It’s Not Possible To Test This Idea”\nThis one is so common but it’s really just lack of education.  It is remarkable how many people – especially startup founders – tell me their product idea is not possible to test.  “The only way we can test this out is to build it.”\nI’m always hesitant to say that they’re absolutely wrong, because there may be product ideas that truly require building it out.  But I do tell them that I still have not run into that situation myself.\nI ask them if they’ve analyzed the various risks?  I ask them if they know about the four main types of prototypes?  I ask them if they understand both qualitative and quantitative techniques?\nIn every case so far, there have been multiple ways to try out their ideas.\nAfter so many years meeting people that believe their idea is not possible to test, it’s certainly no surprise to me that most startups run out of money long before they achieve product/market fit.\n“We Don’t Have Time”\nThis is the most common, yet most frustrating excuse.  Frustrating because it’s such a weak excuse.\nIf a product idea is not risky – the founder/product manager, the designer and the tech lead believe that this is straightforward when it comes to value, usability, feasibility and viability – then we would just proceed to build it.\nHowever, if there is significant risk, then the real question is do you have the time not to test it?\nRealize that it will very likely require several iterations to get this idea working to the point where it achieves the necessary outcome.  If the way you test an idea is to use your engineers to build, QA test, and deploy it, then each iteration will likely take weeks or even months.\nThe underlying principle of product discovery is that if we can’t test out an idea in at least an order of magnitude less time and effort than actually building it, then you’re doing something very wrong.\nThis is why I argue that product discovery skills need to be a core competency of any strong product organization, just as with product delivery skills.\nIf your team has been thinking product discovery is not something you can do because of one or more of the excuses above, I hope this article encourages you to reconsider your position.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-excuses/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925911087,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery - Feedback - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI would be very surprised if there were any product people out there that do not already know that it’s critically important to seek critical feedback. \nYet the reason for this note is because so very often I find product people actively avoiding this negative feedback. \nAs Elon Musk says, “I think it is very important to actively seek out and listen very carefully to negative feedback. This is something people typically tend to avoid because it’s painful. But I think this is a very common mistake – to not actively seek out and listen to negative feedback.”\nAs much as I’m hooked on the data we collect and the quantitative insights we can learn from that, so far I haven’t found anything that can compare to the qualitative feedback we get when we sincerely try to figure out why a person won’t use or buy our product, or why they just cancelled their subscription, or why they have become inactive. \nI’ve made the argument many times, in many places, about how to collect this feedback, and why it’s so incredibly valuable and important.  Yet still I continue to meet people that find any excuse to avoid doing this.\nSo in this article, I’d like to call out the most common excuses I hear, and how I try to coach the product team to get past them.\n“The Truth Hurts”\nAs Elon was alluding to, getting critical feedback can be painful.  Especially if you’ve invested a lot of time and energy into the product you’re getting feedback on.  For many, it’s not really the product that’s getting the negative feedback, it’s the person that defined, designed or built the product.\nIt’s not hard to understand the root of this issue, and of course we want our people to care about their work.  But in terms of coaching, there are three points I try to drive home here:\nFirst, it’s critically important to start getting critical feedback before you fall in love with the idea.  And related to this, if you’re going to fall in love, fall in love with the problem and not the solution.  This is why I so often push teams to get their idea in the form of a prototype as fast as possible, and then get this prototype in front of real users.\nSecond, if you really do want to create an amazing product, then far from this critical feedback being a setback, it’s a chance to find the insights we need to get this product to where it needs to be.  I coach teams to actively seek out this type of feedback and celebrate it when you get it.  The sooner the better, and the more the better.\nThird, if you have set up a weekly cadence of testing your ideas qualitatively with users and customers, this feedback just becomes the normal rhythm of the team and the mindset of the team will quickly change once they’re hooked on the value of the learning.\n“There’s No Time”\nThere’s a lot of talk today about outcomes over output, which I’m glad to see finally getting the attention it deserves.  While it’s not hard to see the appeal of this concept in theory, in practice, it’s not all that surprising that many times you’re faced with the choice of making a date, or spending more time to achieve the necessary outcome. \nNow don’t get me wrong, there are times where deadlines can be valuable and a galvanizing force for the product team, but there are quite a few people out there that are so date focused, they will literally shut down any discussion of anything at all that puts that date in jeopardy.  They would much rather have the effort deemed a failure than to live with missing the date.  Another hallmark of a feature team.\nIn this case, I try to explain the concept of an empty victory, and that they are being held to a higher standard.  I also talk about the concept of a high-integrity commitment for those cases where a date is truly critical, but it’s not enough just to ship output, we have to achieve a result.\n“That’s Not My Customer”\nToday most people are aware of confirmation bias, although I’m not sure that awareness has reduced its frequency very much, as it’s exceedingly common and deeply embedded.\nRecently I was talking to a product team about some very negative feedback, and I realized during the discussion that they weren’t only avoiding critical feedback, they were explicitly seeking confirmation.  \nTheir reasoning was “there is no product that everyone loves, so we’re not interested in the people that don’t like our product – we’re looking to make sure that there are people that do appreciate what we have.”  So they were heavily discounting the negative feedback, and instead clinging to the few encouraging comments they heard as a positive signal that they were on the right track.\nCoaching this problem involves going back to the basics of how and why we test our ideas, and explain that this qualitative feedback – positive or negative – isn’t meant to prove anything one way or another.  It is meant to help us gain insights into our customers and how they perceive our product, so we can improve the product. \n“I Don’t Care”\nFinally, it’s important to acknowledge that many times critical feedback is avoided because the product team just doesn’t GAF.  They feel little sense of ownership over the problem.  They don’t much care if customers like the product or not.  They often don’t like the product themselves.\nThis is an unfortunate consequence of a team of mercenaries, which is common in feature teams.  I don’t want to rehash here all the reasons why we need empowered product teams and not feature teams, but this is a clear example of why Jeff Bezos argues that “we need product teams that think like owners and not like employees.”\nIf you are not regularly (weekly) actively seeking critical negative feedback, then I hope you take a few minutes with your team at your next opportunity to discuss this.  Ask yourselves if you are willing to change that, at least as a test, and then discuss the best way to go about it.  \nWhile your ego might get bruised a bit, I am fairly certain that you and your product will emerge much better for it.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-feedback/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925915996,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery - Judgement - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tTo continue with the series on common sources of confusion regarding product discovery, in this article I want to talk about the critical role of judgement in product discovery.\nThis may in fact be the single most common confusion I encounter.  I think the source of the issue is that so many product people have been led to believe (and wish to believe) that there’s a framework or template for everything.  But product is very much about judgement.\nIn terms of product discovery, there are four consistent areas where judgement is necessary, and I’ll discuss each of them here:\nAssessing Risk\nAt the core of product discovery is that we have four major risks with everything we pursue: value, usability, feasibility and viability.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that all four risks are significant or equal.  Everything we pursue has a different risk profile.  And it’s also true that for many of the minor items, none of the risks are significant.  In which case, we just add the work to the backlog and move on.\nIs it possible you are wrong, and what looks like a minor risk turns out to be a major risk?  Sure.  And occasionally, you learn that the hard way.  But realize that if you were to treat every risk as a major risk, then a) you’ll move way too slowly; and b) you probably won’t have the time you need for the items that truly are major risks.\nMore generally, whenever you consider risk, you need to consider consequence.  \nIn other words, with many risks, if it turns out that you judge something wrong, but the time and effort to correct that mistake is just a few hours of work, then that is a very different situation than when the mistake causes substantial lost revenue, or time and effort to correct.\nSo it’s essential that when planning your discovery work, you consider each of the four risks, and judge both their severity, and the potential consequence.\nNote also that it’s absolutely essential to lean on the other members of your product team when assessing risk.\nOne of the most common, yet largely avoidable, problems is when a product manager judges technical feasibility risk, without consulting the engineers.  When an effort turns out to take substantially longer than anticipated, this is very often the root cause.\nSimilarly, it’s important to lean on the product designer when assessing usability risks.  Especially with complex workflows as is often the case in B2B software, it can be easy to underestimate the complexity and associated risks.\nAssessing Necessary Evidence\nOnce we have identified what we judge to be the major risks, then you’ll need to decide how much evidence you need to be comfortable making a decision.\nEvidence could span the full spectrum with just qualitative opinions from a small group of users at one end, all the way to statistically significant results in a discovery A/B test at the other end.  In between you’ll find qualitative feedback from a larger group, to quantitative feedback but at the lower confidence level that comes from a smaller group, and many other forms of evidence.\nYou could always insist on the highest standard of evidence (statistically significant proof) but with most products, you’ll pay a very high price for that in terms of time.\nWe want to move fast, but we also have a responsibility to protect revenue, brand, customers and colleagues.\nSo we’re back to judgement.  We need to balance time and cost against the risk and consequence.\nFor the teams I advise, I like to save the large scale, live-data tests for the truly risky, high consequence issues, and I like to make the bulk of decisions on much faster, albeit lower confidence, qualitative tests.\nAssessing Scope of Work\nThe third dimension to judgement has to do with recognizing the scope of the product work.  This usually maps directly to consequence, but not always, so it’s important to consider this.\nEvery product team works on a broad range of efforts from simple bug fixes, to performance work, to optimizations, to features, to larger projects to very large initiatives.\nProjects and initiatives are, almost by definition, risky.  Just because of the large time and effort that goes into them.  You really don’t want those to fail.\nOn the other hand, features can range from very minor and low-risk, to very complicated and high-risk.  Even certain bug fixes have the potential to cause real damage.\nSo, again, you’ll need to judge the situation and determine where you need to spend your time in discovery.\nAssessing Necessary Documentation\nThis last area is a bit different than the others, but it’s a very common issue, especially in a work-from-home world.\nOne of the side benefits of co-located product teams is that the engineers are so involved in the discovery work that when something is ready to be built, they often know precisely what they need to do.  \nOne of the side benefits of prototypes is that they do a much better job of describing the necessary behavior than most documents.\nBetween the prototypes and the co-location, the engineers have already identified sources of ambiguity, and have had their questions answered.\nHowever, when the team is not co-located, such as when some or all of the team is working from home, the engineers may not have been participating in the discovery work as much as before, so when it’s time to build, they may have a lot less clarity.  In this case, they may ask for additional documentation.\nThe key is that we need to provide the necessary documentation, but we don’t want to provide anything beyond that, because that’s a big waste of time to produce.\nThe common mistake I find is that companies end up creating a template of this sort of supplementary documentation, and eventually, what begins as very minimal documentation, grows to a big overhead that’s rarely read anyway.\nSo please don’t do the template thing, and instead, use your judgement on each thing you’re describing.  Talk to the engineers about specifically what they need for this case, and then the product manager and designer can provide this.\nThis is one of those cases where experience is a real advantage.  An engineering tech lead, or a product designer, or a product manager that has experienced a broad range of product work will have already learned many of the lessons necessary.\nWhen you have a newer team member, one that likely doesn’t have this experience, then we depend on the person’s manager to provide the necessary coaching on developing this judgement.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-judgement/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925917303,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery - Learning vs. Insights - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI introduced the term product discovery about 15 years ago, and I’ve loved watching the industry gradually broaden its mind from the concept of someone – either an old-school business analyst or a product manager – defining requirements, to the concept of a product manager, product designer and lead engineer working collaboratively to discover a successful solution.\nI’m especially happy to see so many smart people contributing discovery techniques, and helping others learn how to do effective product discovery work.\nHowever, as happens in every industry, there’s also people out there that have simply rebranded their tired old product thoughts as product discovery, which of course can confuse new product people. And this is why I recently wrote Product Management – Start Here.\nBut even without bad actors, as with any complex concept, there is a lot of nuance and especially in the age of Twitter sound bites, it’s easy to get confused.\nSo I find I spend a good amount of time working to clarify common misconceptions.\nIn this and the next several articles, I will be discussing the most common confusions I find out there.\nThe subject of this first article is the difference between learning and insights.  \nOf course, learning is good, so I’m not suggesting that learning isn’t valuable.\nSimilarly, insights are a type of learning.  The point is that they are learnings that we can leverage.  One leader I know likes to say “insights are learnings we can take to the bank.”\nWe generally learn every day we are working on product discovery activities, but what we’re really searching for are insights.\nMostly what we learn is that our solution does not work as well as we had hoped.  But occasionally what we learn provides an insight into how to fix it.  These insights change how we approach the problem we’ve been asked to solve.  When that insight leads to an effective solution, we declare victory.\nSometimes an insight is important enough that we realize that the impact goes beyond the problem we’re working on, and is perhaps even important enough to be leveraged in our product strategy.  Strong product leaders are always on the lookout for these sorts of insights.\nAnd very occasionally, the insight is so profound that it causes us to revisit everything, possibly even changing the course of the company.  This is called a vision pivot.\nNow nothing I’ve just said should really be a surprise.  If you’ve had any meaningful training on product discovery, this should all sound very familiar.\nThe reason for this article is a bit more nuanced.\nMany product teams talk a lot about the importance of learning.  And I do too, although I’ve tried to be more careful with my words on this for the past year or so.\nHere’s the problem: \nThe purpose of a product team is not to learn.  \nThe purpose of a product team is to solve hard problems in ways our customers love yet work for the business.\nNow, learning helps us do that, but it’s critical to never lose sight of the fact that learning is the means not the ends. \nIn other words, you can be a product team that’s great at learning, but if your team doesn’t know how to close the deal and solve the problem for the customer, you are not a strong product team.\nFor many years I’ve seen the same issue play out with many different techniques.  Teams get so excited about their personas that they obsess over the technique, and don’t turn the technique into successful products. Or they get so excited about design thinking. Or jobs-to-be-done.  Or their use of Agile.  The list goes on. \nAll of these techniques can provide real value, but only if you stay focused on solving the problem you’ve been asked to solve.\nOne last pointed example of this problem:\nOne of the most common questions I get about OKRs, is whether the team should have an OKR to measure their learning in product discovery?  \nWhile I do encourage teams to make sure they’re practicing the techniques necessary to do effective product discovery, I push them to keep their key results as business results, and not fall into the trap of confusing the means with the ends.\nSo in your product discovery work, and especially in your discussions with stakeholders and senior leadership, be sure to keep the focus and discussion on the insights and the results.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-learning-vs-insights/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925816681,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery - Problem vs. Solution - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tTo continue with the series on common misunderstandings about product discovery, in this article I’d like to discuss a very fundamental confusion that exists with a remarkably large segment of the product community.  For some people, this is even an emotional issue as it gets to the core of what a lot of product people think of as gospel, but they are paying a very high price for this mindset.\nFor as long as our industry has existed, people have wanted to separate the product world into “problem space” and “solution space.”  The problem your customer has, and the solution we provide to address that problem.\nThis is certainly logical, and for many simple situations honestly it’s not a serious issue, but I’ve always resisted being dogmatic about this, because in so many of the best products and innovations, the breakthroughs happen precisely when we break down that wall between problem and solution space.\nThe clearest example of this is when enabling technology opens up solutions to problems that people didn’t even realize they had.  This is what is so fundamentally different about technology powered products.  Our customers often have no idea what is just now possible.\nMore generally, with technology products, as you explore potential solutions, your understanding of the problem develops and deepens, often in unexpected and powerful ways.\nSo this is an important principle to understand about product discovery, but beyond this, one consequence of this problem vs solution space thinking is how often I find product teams that associate product discovery only with “exploring the problem space.”\nThese people have this overly simplistic notion that product management and product design work to define the problem, and then engineering works to build a solution.  \nSuch a nice, clean separation between what product and design do, and what engineering does.\nUnfortunately, this overly simplistic thinking usually kills any chance for real innovation.\nFirst, we should get out of the way, the harmless consequence of this thinking: there is no problem with making sure you understand the customer’s problem, and that it is indeed a real problem.  We have very good, fast techniques for this, including discovery framing techniques and demand validation techniques, and there’s simply no excuse not to use these if you’re unsure of the problem, or if demand is uncertain.  And I’ve written many times about the value of including at least one engineer with you every time you visit a customer, or otherwise work to understand the problem.\nFew things are more wasteful and frustrating than spending a ton of energy solving a problem that customers don’t care about.\nBut that’s rarely where the issue is.\nThe vast majority of product efforts fail not because of demand, but because they can’t come up with a solution good enough to get people to switch.\nUltimately our job in product discovery is not just to validate the problem, but to come up with a solution that customers love, yet works for our business.  What this means specifically is to come up with a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible and viable.\nAnd this is why in strong product companies, the vast majority of our product discovery work is spent – and needs to be spent – on the solution.\nAnd hopefully it’s clear to you that this goes well beyond just engineering.  It is the collaboration of product (representing value and viability), design (representing usability) and engineering (representing feasibility) that generates great products.\nIt is the interplay between these three dimensions.  Technology enables better experiences and new functionality.  Good user experiences aren’t just usable, but they increase value.  And of course understanding the various legal, privacy, ethical, financial, sales, and marketing constraints informs the functionality, experience and value.  It is the intense give-and-take between these considerations that can yield a winning solution.\nThis is such a fundamental and important point about product, and it’s too important to not understand.  Just consider any of your favorite products: \nMP3 players existed for years, and then the iPod came along and was dramatically better.  Cell phones existed for years, and then the iPhone came along.  Search engines existed for years, and then Google came along.  We’ve watched movies for years, and then Netflix came along.  We’ve listened to music for years, and then Spotify came along.  Teams needed to communicate for years, and then Slack came along.  We’ve needed places to stay when we travel for years, and then AirBnB came along.  We had free and fair elections for years, and then Facebook came along.\nIt’s worth noting that if you have a crappy solution, it can look to you like the demand isn’t there.  You know you can’t sell it, and it’s tempting to blame this on demand, but this is rarely a sign that the problem isn’t real; it’s much more often a sign that your solution is not perceived by the customers as better than the alternatives, and certainly not better enough to persuade the customer to switch.\nOne other factor that’s worth calling out.  You need to realize that as soon as you start working on a problem, as far as your management is concerned, the clock starts ticking.  And soon enough, they will want to see results.  If you spend most of that time going deep into the problem, it can leave you with very little time for the solution.  So you need to pace yourself.\nSo, if you feel you must think in terms of problem space and solution space, then at least please always keep in mind two critical points: first, most of your time will need to be spent working on the solution; and second, don’t associate the problem with product management, and the solution with engineering – understanding the problem and developing the solution requires the intense collaboration of product, design and engineering.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-problem-vs-solution/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925864099,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery When Working Remotely - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNormally the question I focus on in my work and in my writing is “How can we leverage the best practices of the very best companies in order to give ourselves the very best chance for continuous innovation?”\nWhile there are many practices that are important and contribute to this, I have long been a champion of the power of the co-located product team. \nThis Jeff Bezos quote sums up my experiences quite well:\n“At Amazon, a product team has a clear mission, specific goals, and needs to be cross-functional, dedicated, and co-located.  Why? Creativity comes from people’s interactions; inspiration comes from intensive concentration. Just like a start-up, the team huddles together in a garage, experimenting, iterating, discussing, debating, trying and retrying, again and again.”\nI don’t think it’s an accident that Amazon is the most consistently innovative company in our industry.\nAll that said, for many companies, today the question has changed.  \nNow I’m being asked, “How can we leverage best practices to give ourselves the best chance at innovation, in the scenario where the product team is distributed and each person is working remotely?”\nAddressing this important question is the subject of this article.\nThere’s no need to discuss the well-understood tools and methods that distributed teams have adopted to communicate and manage their work.  I will assume you are already familiar with the range of cloud-based collaboration tools, and video-based communication services.\nI will also assume that everyone understands the major advantages of being able to tap into talent around the globe.\nInstead, we’ll dive deeper into the nature of cross-functional product teams, and discuss where you should focus your attention to continue to make forward progress as a team.\nFirst, there are really the two major types of activities in every empowered product team: discovery and delivery.  \nWhen people talk about the magic of co-location, they are mainly talking about innovation and discovery, as in the Amazon quote above.\nIn delivery, it’s more of a trade-off.  Communication is of course easier when sitting together, but so are unwanted interruptions.  Overall, I find teams with remote employees can do quite well in delivery, occasionally even better than when the team is co-located.\nThe real challenge of remote employees is when we consider the discovery work.\nThe overall methods and mechanics are not really very different when working remotely versus co-located for discovery work.  \nI’ll discuss more of the impact on discovery techniques in a future article, but for now, we still have many product ideas, and we still try them out quickly, usually by creating a prototype, and then testing on real users either qualitatively or quantitatively.\nObviously our qualitative testing is not likely to be literally face-to-face, but we can and should make up for that with increased video-based testing, which of course is better than ever.\nThe important differences impact the dynamics of how the product manager, product designer and tech lead collaborate to discover a solution worth building.\nThere are three serious problems that I consistently see, and any of these three can meaningfully damage your ability to innovate.\nArtifacts\nAs soon as you separate the product manager from the product designer from the tech lead, a very common anti-pattern arises.  \nInstead of the three sitting down together to discuss the question “how do we solve this problem?” there is a nearly gravity-like pull to start producing artifacts for each other.\nThe product designer asks the product manager to write down some type of “brief” or requirements or constraints.\nThe tech lead asks the designer when she can provide some wireframes so the engineers can start planning.\nThe product manager asks the engineers for estimates.\nVery soon, the new remote work process has reverted back to waterfall-like passing along of artifacts, and not only will innovation suffer, but the entire discussion will quickly move back to output, rather than outcome.\nThis is a tendency that you have to continuously fight.  It may feel less efficient to discuss these topics in a video-call between the three of you, but it’s essential that you return to the “how do we solve this problem?” discussion.\nDuring discovery, the main artifact should be prototypes.\nNow, it’s true that once you do decide to build something in delivery, the engineers that are now remote will likely not be as up to date on the latest prototype, so you will need to spend some time describing in sufficient detail what the engineers need to build and QA test.  But that’s only after you believe you have a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible and viable.\nTrust\nDiscovery in general and innovation in particular depends on this concept of psychological safety – which essentially means that the members of your product team feel respected and their contributions are welcome and valued.\nI’ve written earlier about how even one asshole on the product team can destroy this dynamic.  Fortunately, most people are not assholes, at least not in person.  Unfortunately, it’s no secret that when people are separated from one another, and you’re not speaking directly to someone’s face, the normal filters and sensitivity can fade.\nMore than a few people have shared with me that they are seeing a different side of their colleagues, and it’s not always a good look.\nThis is where coaching is so essential.  In my experience, most people don’t intend to be cruel or insensitive, they just don’t have as many of the social cues to go on. A good manager can coach the employee on their online interactions with the rest of the team, and help them realize where they can improve.\nAlso, it may seem like it would be more efficient to send an email or slack message, but if a poorly phrased message breaks the trust and requires hours of damage control, it maybe wasn’t so efficient after all.\nWhen working remotely, it’s always better to handle anything that might be interpreted as sensitive over video. It’s not as good as in-person, but it’s still much better for including the facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language that are so important to developing and maintaining trust. \nTime\nFor some people, they have a work from home environment that is largely insulated from interruptions, and they find themselves feeling more productive than ever, especially when it comes to quality time to think through hard problems.\nHowever, for many others, especially those that have found themselves suddenly forced to deal with child care or homeschooling obligations, they yearn for the ease of going into the office where they could escape the burdens of home life, and get work done again.\nThe reality is that not all members of your product team will likely have the same amount of quality time to meaningfully contribute.  Getting even an hour a day of uninterrupted time might be very difficult.\nMy main suggestion here is to try to be flexible.  Let’s suppose your product designer has young children, and can only manage a solid hour of uninterrupted time at an early or late hour.  If the product manager and tech lead can find a way to accommodate that, it’s worth doing.\nI realize that none of these three items – artifacts, trust, or time – are easy challenges to deal with.  They’re not.  \nBut if you find your team no longer delivering the results you once did, I would not be surprised if it was due to one or more of these three problems.\nWith the members of the product team being aware of the potential for these problems, and with the managers providing coaching on avoiding or dealing with these problems, you can manage to do good product discovery work in a remote employee environment.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-when-working-remotely/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925891856,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery vs. Design - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tOne nomenclature clarification before we dive into this:  Normally in my writing I try to be consistent and say that when I reference “design” I am speaking specifically about user experience design.  However, for this particular article, when I say design I mean both user experience design as well as software / architecture design.\nI’m glad to see that many people now have a much better understanding of the differences between a feature team and an empowered product team.  \nJust recently Jeff Patton shared a very compelling article digging into this difference, and describing his theory on the mindset behind feature teams.\nIn this article, I’d like to discuss one of the very common questions I get from people that are unfortunately working on feature teams: “Does the concept of product discovery even apply to feature teams?”\nI want to be careful with my answer as I don’t want to be in the role of some sort of defender of the integrity of the concept of product discovery, and I also fully realize that not everyone will be able to convince their company to try transforming, or be able to easily move to a strong product company.\nAt one level, this is an easy question.  Product discovery is about coming up with an effective solution to the problem we have been asked to solve.  \nAs you hopefully know, empowered product teams are given problems to solve, and empowered to discover a solution.\nIn contrast, the defining characteristic of a feature team is that the team is not given problems to solve; they are instead given a list of features and projects to build, usually in the form of a roadmap.\nWhatever stakeholder requested the specific feature very likely has a problem in mind, but that person is essentially describing the solution they imagine will work best for them.\nSo by these definitions, discovery is not relevant for feature teams.\nBut this short easy answer is oversimplified, and it’s worth digging a bit deeper.  \nRecall that in product discovery there are always four risks to consider: value, usability, feasibility and viability.  In an empowered product team we need the three critical competencies of product management, product design and engineering in order to address all four of these risks.\nHowever, in a feature team, it is the stakeholder that is implicitly taking responsibility for value and viability (which is why on a feature team, the product manager plays more of a project manager role, but that’s a secondary point).\nOn a feature team, the stakeholders are counting on the team to address the usability and feasibility risks, which is why we still need product designers and of course engineers.\nSo you could argue that at least some discovery is still relevant to a feature team.  And I do point out to feature teams that they are building skills that can help them in the future on an empowered product team.\nBut it’s also important to point out that it’s one level of skill to design a usable experience (designers) and a feasible architecture (engineers) for a specific feature, but it’s a whole other level of skill to be able to discover an effective solution to the problem (and then of course we still have to design that solution).\nIn addition to the increased skill required, there is also significantly more pressure in that for a feature team, if the solution doesn’t work as the stakeholder had hoped, then that’s ultimately on the stakeholder.\nBut in an empowered product team, if our solution does not achieve the necessary outcome, that’s on us.  Being accountable to results is hard.\nAnother way of explaining this is that discovery is all about trying out different approaches to a problem to find one that works.  On a feature team, you are essentially already given the approach, and you need to do what you can to make it as good as possible.\nIn any case, the more the product manager of a feature team can do to demonstrate to leaders that she understands the various dimensions of the business (viability), and has an in-depth understanding of the actual customers (especially regarding value), the more likely the leaders will be to let the feature team try tackling a hard problem to show what they can do.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-vs-design/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925908031,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Discovery vs. Documentation - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThe problem that I want to write about today has always been a problem, but in truth, the pandemic has made this problem substantially worse.  \nIn particular, I am worried about teams reverting back to the heavy use of artifacts such as product requirements documents (e.g. PRD’s).\nI was afraid this would happen, and I tried to warn against this in many of my talks and interviews, and explicitly in the article Discovery When Working Remotely.\nHow did I know this was likely to happen?  \nBecause long before the pandemic, companies have been experimenting with different forms of remote work.  \nAnd while some activities worked well with remote (like delivery), other activities struggled (like discovery), and there are only so many ways teams would deal with those challenges.\nNote that this article is not trying to advocate for or against remote work.  There is no question there are many benefits especially regarding access to talent around the world, just as there is little question today that there are challenges.\nThis article is instead trying to help teams dealing with remote employees – especially with remote engineers – do better.\nI understand where the desire for a return to old style requirements documents is coming from.  I’ve talked to so many developers that are just so fatigued trying to understand what it is that they need to build, that often they just throw up their hands and say, “just write down whatever you want, and we can get to work building it, but honestly I don’t care anymore.”\nFor several years now I have been trying to emphasize that when you cut through all the process noise and methods out there, there are really three things that matter when it comes to how strong product teams work:\nFirst, considering and addressing the risks up front (value, usability, feasibility and viability), before the engineers are asked to write a line of production code.\nSecond, solving problems collaboratively in a give and take between product, design and engineering, rather than sequentially (product manager writing up requirements, the designer providing a design that satisfies those requirements, and engineers building to those requirements).\nThird, focusing on solving the actual customer and business problems (outcomes) and not just delivery features (output).\nAnd the tragic thing is that when people get so frustrated and fatigued with the overhead of collaboration that they just give up and instead just ask for a specification, they lose all of this.\nIt’s essential to realize that a PRD addresses precisely none of these problems.\nBut here’s the thing: PRD’s are not inherently bad.  \nIf the product team does the necessary product discovery work to figure out a solution worth building, and then they add the step of documenting the details of what needs to be built so as to better communicate with remote engineers, that’s fine.\nThe problem is that in nearly every case I see, the PRD is written instead of the product discovery work, rather than after.\nWhen a product manager is pressed to write a PRD with the detailed requirements, without doing the discovery work, they really have no idea if what they are describing will be something the customer will buy, or will be able to figure out how to use, or if the solution will work for the business, or if the engineers can even deliver the solution with the time, skills and technology available.\nWithout the prototyping of those ideas, and the back and forth with design and engineering to iterate and improve those ideas, and then the testing of those prototypes with users and customers, and with stakeholders to ensure the solutions will work for the business, it is just very unlikely that the necessary outcome will be achieved. \nAnd then we’re back to the resulting finger-pointing: engineers complaining they built what they were told; designers complaining they were already given the weak solution; and product managers complaining they just documented what they were told was needed.\nThe same is true with product roadmaps.  They are not inherently bad.  If the deliverables they are describing (the features and projects) are the result of product discovery work, then it’s simply a useful communication tool about what’s coming and when.\nHowever, if the product roadmap of features and projects is created before or instead of the product discovery work, then we’re back to a bunch of commitments for things that likely won’t deliver the necessary outcomes.\n(There is a different type of product roadmap that you may have read about from me or others called an outcome-based roadmap, that lists desired outcomes/problems to be solved rather than features and projects – but in my experience these are unfortunately the exception and not the rule).\nSo the key message from this article is that it is ok to spend the time to document the details to ease the pain of communication with your remote colleagues, but please don’t do that in lieu of your product discovery work.\nYes, it’s harder to collaborate when your colleagues are remote.  But with effort and continuous prototyping, you can do what you need to. \nYes, it’s a pain to have to document in more detail than when the team is co-located.  But just think of this documentation step as a necessary tax.  It will slow you down a little, but it can help your engineering and QA to better understand the details.\nYou might be wondering if these same problems exist when instead of PRD’s the team just uses user stories?  Yes, much of what I describe is really a consequence of not doing product discovery.  However, PRD’s have a way of magnifying the problem.  I know this sounds odd, but as you probably know, user stories themselves are pretty useless.  But that in fact is what make them useful.  They make no pretense about describing requirements.  They are simply a placeholder for a discussion.  And that’s what’s good about them.  We need that conversation.\nAs soon as the product manager writes an actual PRD, there is a certain gravity to that document, and people are much less likely to challenge or question, than just assume the “requirements” are a given.\nI have to admit I got pretty good at writing these PRD’s.  Sometimes I even found myself believing what I wrote myself, despite having no real evidence.\nSo why is this issue so important?  \nBecause if you believe that your business depends on continuous innovation, then you need to realize just how much damage you are doing to your chances.  Your engineers really are the most important thing.  \nAnd when you just provide those engineers requirements instead of collaborating with them in determining what the right solution is, then you are effectively neutering those engineers.\nAnd to those of you that are product leaders, this is really on you.\nYou need to decide how important continuous innovation is to your company and to your customers.  If you think you can get what you need by having product managers document PRD’s instead of product discovery, then you may as well just give up on innovation and hire Accenture.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/discovery-vs-documentation/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925806046,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"EMPOWERED: Ordinary People, Extraordinary

Engineers FAQ - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my last article I spoke about the concept of an empowered engineer, which I consider the single most important concept for companies that want to move from feature teams to product teams.\nOverall my sense was that most people understood the points, and many told me they could personally relate as they have seen the power of an empowered engineer first-hand.   \nHowever, I did get several questions, and the topic did generate some conversation on social media, and some of the questions and opinions out there are frankly disturbing.  So, I thought it would be good to get these thoughts on the table, and confront them head on.\nThe reason this is important is because I believe that some of these opinions are at the core of why product management has such a poor reputation in so many companies.  \nMore generally, many people over the years have expressed frustration and confusion as to why so many strong product companies require (or at least very strongly prefer) product manager candidates that have a technology background.  I think this dialog helps to explain why these companies feel so strongly about a technology degree.\n“My engineers are not interested in anything but coding.”\nThis is by far the most common excuse from people that don’t believe in empowered engineers.  I have heard it countless times, mostly when I ask a product manager or product designer why their engineers aren’t participating in the product discovery work.\nThe first thing I should acknowledge is that occasionally this is true, and I’ll come back to this situation later.  But in my experience this is the exception.\nWhenever I hear this, I insist on speaking to the engineers directly.  Much more often than not, this is not what the engineers say at all.  In fact, the most common complaint I hear from the engineers is that they are not included until it’s too late, and they are forced to deal with the consequences.  \nWhat’s usually going on is that the product manager doesn’t want the engineers to be included because he would rather the engineers spend their time coding.  So in this case the issue is an over-zealous product manager, either hearing what he wants to hear, or not caring enough to even ask.\nHowever, sometimes the engineers do tell me they don’t really care much about discovery – they prefer to code, and are fine building “whatever.”  In this case, I ask the last time any of the engineers were able to personally visit with a customer?  And the answer is usually between a very long time ago, and never.\nBut as I said above, sometimes not even a single one of the engineers has any desire to do anything other than code.  In this case, my discussion moves to the CTO/VP Engineering, and I explain that they have mercenaries and not missionaries, and why they need to raise their bar on hiring engineers.  At a minimum, they need at least one true tech lead on each product team, and discovery is one of the big responsibilities of the tech lead.\n“If I give my engineers this kind of power, all they will want to do is over-engineer and play with new technologies.”\nIf this is true (and not just another reason to keep the engineers focused on coding), then this is describing an empowered engineer but without motivation or focus.\nAn empowered engineer depends on having a visceral understanding of the customer’s pain.  Strong engineers hate to see customers that are struggling or unhappy.  They take it personally.\nThis is why it is so powerful to bring engineers to see customers directly.  They should be shown the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n“Our best engineers only want to work on what they consider hard technical problems.”\nThis might be the same issue as above, or it may be these strong engineers are doing exactly the right thing because they are empowered engineers and they do understand the business.  For example, fault tolerance and site availability are very hard technical problems, but they are primarily business and customer problems.  Same with zero-downtime initiatives.  Same with continuous delivery.  Same with dealing with scale during times of rapid growth.\n“My engineers are clueless about our customers.”\nAs I said above, this may be true, but if it is, this is squarely the fault of the product manager, and should be corrected immediately.\n“I took a programming class in college.  I can serve this role, so my engineers can focus on delivery.”\nYou may be thinking nobody would really be arrogant or clueless enough to think or say this, but multiple people did.  I’m not sure what to do with people that think like this, other than try very hard not to hire them.\n“If this is what my engineers are supposed to be doing, then what is my role?”\nThis is a remarkably common sentiment, especially from PM’s of feature teams.  The empowered engineer concept is just so far from their current reality that they have a hard time wrapping their heads around this concept.  That’s because it highlights the need for a very different type of product manager.  I point these people to the difference between feature teams and product teams.\n“Of course I agree with empowered engineers.  As product manager, my job is to clearly define the problem to solve, and the measure of success, and then get out of the way.”\nI’ve seen this opinion floating around on the fringes for years.  But hopefully everyone can see how ridiculous this is.  In fact, if you have a product strategy, then this has already been done for you by your manager.  And how long would it take your manager to realize that she can move your headcount to get another engineer or designer and not lose a thing?\nOf course, someone who really thinks this is very likely at a company that doesn’t have a true product strategy, and is almost certainly a feature team product manager, which as I’ve said and this clearly illustrates, is really a project manager.\n“Do you think it’s possible to be an empowered engineer if our company uses SAFe?”\nOnly a couple people asked me this.  And I’m pretty sure they already knew the answer.  I’m sorry but I don’t see how, as the models are polar opposites in terms of the role of engineers.  But hopefully this concept gives you a better understanding of why processes like SAFe are not used at true tech-powered companies that depend on innovation.\n“Does this mean that product designers and product managers are not important?”\nI find it hard to believe that anyone that’s been reading my writing over the past many years could think this, but some did.  As I said in the opening of The Most Important Thing: “Certainly, I’m not saying [an empowered engineer is] all that’s required, as extraordinary products come from product teams.”\nIf you’re still confused about the concept of an empowered engineer, I am hoping that at least one of these other articles will resonate with you: Customer Inspired; Technology Enabled, The Role of Technology and Empowered Product Teams.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/empowered-engineers-faq/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925934712,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Ensuring Excellence - Silicon Valley Product

which is the power and potential of empowered product teams.\nBut nevertheless, I think this topic has largely been missing from my writing, and it’s too important not to address.\nWe talk a great deal about assigning teams problems to solve, and giving them clear, quantifiable outcomes as goals.  The point of course is that shipping output that doesn’t move the needle is not a success in any meaningful sense.\nAll of the above I absolutely stand behind.  And it is the higher order point.\nThat said, in so many of the best product companies there is an additional dimension that goes beyond individual empowered product teams, and even goes beyond achieving business results.\nIt has to do with ensuring a level of what I’ll refer to here as “excellence” although that is clearly a very ambiguous term.\nOver the years, this concept has been referred to by many different names, always necessarily vague, but all striving to convey the same thing: “desirability,” “aha moments,” “wow

provide something special.  \nMaybe it’s because we believe this is needed to achieve the necessary value.  Maybe it’s because the company has built its brand on inspiring customers.\nOften this dimension shows up most clearly in product design, where functional, usable but uninspiring designs can often achieve our business results, but great design can propel us into this realm of the inspiring.\nTo be very clear, I’m not suggesting that this dimension of excellence is critical for every product team and every product company.  Most would do well to just get to the point of consistently achieving real results.\nBut I also don’t want to ignore the powerful role this plays in so many great product companies.\nDoes Google really need playful doodles to deliver the value they consistently provide in search results?\nDoes Stripe really need to spend so much energy on the design of its site and SDK’s, which after all, are primarily for the developers that use their API’s?\nDoes Apple really need to sweat the literally thousands of very subtle and often not consciously noticed interactions on its devices?\nIn The Lost Interview, Steve Jobs spoke of this dimension of excellence as “spirit,” as in, in his view, Apple’s products had them, and Microsoft’s products didn’t.\nThe real question, and the elephant in the room, is how to introduce this element, without undermining team empowerment?\nOne analogy I find helpful in describing this is the role of the “bar raiser” on an interview team.  \nFor those that don’t know what this is, the way several strong product companies ensure that they are maintaining staff quality while hiring (especially when growing rapidly) is by having someone join each interview team as an additional interviewer, where he or she is there to ensure that a candidate that one product team considers strong, another doesn’t consider weak.  \nThe bar raiser participates on the interview team for many different parts of the organization, ensuring a consistently high bar across all teams.\nDoes this disempower the interview teams?  I don’t think so.  It is providing a holistic view of candidates that the other interview team members aren’t likely to have.\nSimilarly, when a product leader reviews the work of a product team, beyond ensuring that the team understands and delivers on their key results, that leader sometimes also weighs in on this topic of product excellence.\nIn some companies this is coming from the design leader.  In others, the product leader.  And in others, it is the CEO.  Although with empowered employees with a high-degree of psychological safety, this feedback might come from anyone.\nCertainly there is sensitivity to how this opinion is shared with the product team.  \nThis interaction with the leader has the potential to be either very inspiring to push for something even better, or very demoralizing if the team feels they are chasing some intangible, unrealistic and unachievable expectation.\nIn truth, I’ve experienced each.  And this is why it’s a difficult topic to discuss.  The last thing I want to do is encourage Steve Jobs wannabes.\nMy favorite place to capture this dimension of product excellence is in the product principles, which typically are developed alongside a strong and compelling product vision.  I tell product teams that product principles, when done well, can help translate the brand promise into something more tangible and actionable for the product teams.\nThe difference is in the pointing out to the team when a product, or more likely a prototype in product discovery, is not living up to these principles.\nIt’s one thing to have a product principle along the lines of “we strive to exceed our customer’s expectations,” and another thing to point out to a product team that their work is not quite at this level.\nThe main point of this article is to acknowledge the role that a strong product leader plays in looking holistically across the many product efforts, and not being afraid to engage when necessary with the product teams to encourage them to aim higher.  Do your best to make this an inspirational interaction and not a demotivating one.\nWhat’s important to keep in mind is that most strong product teams really do want to create something they can be personally proud of, and if handled well, this interaction can give the team both permission and encouragement to reach higher.  Acknowledge this.  Encourage this. Show appreciation for this.  \nBut also do your best to try to make as clear as possible in what ways a particular design or approach may be falling short of the product principles.\nAnd when product teams do step up and deliver something that not only delivers results, but also manifests excellence in the sense we’re describing, by all means, recognize it and celebrate it.\nSpecial thanks to Chris Jones and Shreyas Doshi for their very helpful feedback on early drafts of this article.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/ensuring-excellence/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925840086,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Enterprise Software - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI’m frustrated by the state of the Enterprise Software industry, and I have been for quite some time. While there are some notable exceptions, I find fewer examples of good products in this space than any other. Many people view the enterprise software market as “mature” or worse, but I think customers are just frustrated and aren’t anxious to spend yet more money on more disappointing products. And they’re just not willing to dish out hundreds of thousands of dollars – or even millions – on “professional services” just to get them working.\nI think there are a number of reasons for why the industry is in this state, but regardless, I believe that good product management can help improve the situation substantially.\nBefore I get started, let me clarify what I mean by that very general term: “Enterprise Software.” The two key points to clarify are who the software is sold to, and what type of software product we’re talking about.\nRegarding who the software is sold to, the main point is that the products are sold to businesses rather than consumers. There is of course a full-spectrum of business size, and I’m intentionally not including the small office/home office/small business markets, because in my view they’re really much more like the consumer market than the enterprise market (and the reason so many companies in the past tried and failed in the huge small biz market is because they didn’t realize this fact and its implications for product requirements). I do however include medium-size businesses in this even though many people reserve the term “Enterprise” for a group like the Fortune 500. But I think many of the challenges start to show with mid-size businesses.\nAnd then there’s the type of software. Enterprise Infrastructure products (e.g. security software, systems management, communications software) have some significant differences from Enterprise Applications (e.g. SFA, CRM, ERP), but I’ll speak to both here. I think the top 10 list is essentially the same, although I’d weight the importance of each item differently based on whether it’s infrastructure or application.\nOK, so here is a list of ten techniques that are especially important for enterprise software companies:\n1. Usability – Pity the poor souls that must sit at their desks all day and use the typical enterprise applications for purchasing, billing, customer service, and hundreds of other applications. If the people that actually had to use the systems were the ones that made the actual buying decisions I think we’d have a very different set of vendors. I’m very sorry to say it, but most of the applications are just awful. One of my favorite books is “The Inmates are Running the Asylum” by Alan Cooper. Nowhere is his argument truer than with enterprise software. I find too few enterprise companies doing any interaction design, visual design, or usability testing, and it certainly shows. Even when the application produces business results, there is still a sour taste in the mouth and you rarely find true enthusiasm for these types of products. It really is time to raise the bar.\n2. Product Actually Needs to Work – Even more egregious than the poor product usability, there are still too many enterprise products that simply don’t work. At least not without tremendous investments in time and money to “customize” and “integrate” or without countless work-arounds. This is certainly not the case with all products, but the many out there that ship with often hundreds of serious defects give a bad reputation to all of us. The state of software QA is also not where I think it should be, but that’s another topic. As product manager, it’s essential to make sure your product does what it says it will.\n3. Specials – One of the biggest mistakes companies make is that they think they can get their product requirements from their customers. I’ve talked about this elsewhere, but the most dangerous example of this is when the sales organization brings in a potential customer that has a big check all ready to sign if you’ll just agree to put these 14 features in your product. And soon you’re essentially a custom software shop and you don’t have anything resembling a generally useful product, and there’s a good chance even that initial customer isn’t happy with those 14 features (once they got it and tried it they realized they needed something different). Avoiding specials takes a lot of discipline, especially for a small company struggling to bring in some cash, but it is critical that you create products that meet the needs of a wide range of customers.\n4. Customers and Customer Advisory Boards – The above is not to say that you shouldn’t listen to your customers – you should absolutely meet with and listen to many customers – just don’t expect them to be able to dictate your product requirements. To determine the real product requirements you’ll need to meet with many customers, and one valuable technique is to identify a half-dozen or so great potential customers (smart, enthusiastic, motivated, friendly) and invite them to participate on a “customer advisory board.” In exchange for the opportunity to work closely with the development team, they know that their needs will be understood and seriously considered, and they agree to be accessible to try out ideas and answer questions, and install software immediately and if it meets their needs to be vocal reference customers. Your goal should always be to have at least half a dozen live, happy customers when you release your product.\n5. Designing for the Sales Channel – It’s critical to design your product around the needs of your sales and distribution channel. Different channels require different capabilities. The key is to provide value all along the distribution chain. If you’re selling through systems integrators, you’ll need to ensure that your product doesn’t try to cut them out of the equation. If you’re selling through VARs that supply a wide range of products, you need to ensure that your product doesn’t overwhelm them with time-consuming technical requirements. Many otherwise good products struggle because they’re not appropriate for their sales channel.\n6. The Customer versus the User – Many enterprise products are designed around the needs of the person that will actually buy the product. They are “the customer” and that’s who the team talks to when learning about needs, and that’s who has to give the ok in order to sell the product. However, as we alluded to above, there are often several different users of the product that also bring needs and requirements. For example, the different types of end-users, the systems administrators, management, and often other business applications.\n7. Product Installation – With consumer products, the vendors know that they have to make the product absolutely bullet-proof to install and something that just takes minutes or even seconds. But with enterprise products, many vendors have come to assume that they’ll be able to get dedicated systems administration staff that can craft custom installations that can take days or even weeks of work. And that these administrators will be able to watch over the applications daily. Even when this is true, when the person moves on, or is out due to vacation or illness, or just gets overloaded, things can quickly fall apart. Again, it’s time to raise the bar.\n8. Product Configuration, Customization and Integration – An enormous professional services industry has emerged to fill the gap and try and get these enterprise software products to actually work, and further, to work with each other. I believe that the vast majority of that cost is simply due to poor product design and execution. However, even if you accept that the need for services is appropriate, there is still much that can be done by vendors to make their products easier to configure, customize and integrate.\n9. Product Update – Installing a new version of enterprise software is never fun. The vendor thinks it’s the biggest event of the year, but the customer has their business to run, and installing updates of vendor software isn’t something they typically want to be spending their precious time and resources on. Having problems upgrading or requiring complex data migration is extremely frustrating to the customer. Again, most consumer products realize this and make a much bigger investment in technology to upgrade and in testing the upgrade process.\n10. The Sales Process – For many years, in the enterprise software market, far too much of the sale was driven by the talents/personality/charm of the respective sales staff. A product selection was too often driven by the relationship between the sales rep and the customer rather than by whether the product was the best fit or not. While the relationship aspects are still very important (still more than they should be) today the Internet has changed the product research and evaluation process, and vendors need to support this new sales process.\nIf you can keep these 10 points front-and-center as you create your enterprise software products, you’ll be far ahead of your competition and your customers are sure to be grateful.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/enterprise-software/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925817293,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Example PRFAQ - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nNote: \nThis is an example of a PRFAQ (which is one type of “6-page written narrative”). It’s important to understand that this document is not a real press release.  It is an example of a technique used to propose and consider a major new product offering.  \nThe idea is to first summarize the benefits of the potential new offering, and the press release format lends itself well to speaking to customer benefits.  Then the press release is followed by a set of questions and answers that have been anticipated by the author (usually the product manager).  \nThis allows those reviewing the PRFAQ to judge whether the proposal has been carefully considered, and the various perspectives and concerns acknowledged.\nContext:\nThis company currently runs a jobs marketplace with job seekers on one side, and hiring managers on the other.  The hiring managers post jobs directly, and most are hiring managers at small and medium sized companies where they have little to no help from an established HR department.\nThe company is considering whether or not they should expand their offering to make their services more suitable for large Enterprises which do have a full HR department including sourcing and staffing professionals.\nThis PRFAQ is based on one created by the jobs marketplace company profiled in the EMPOWERED Case Study.  The document has been tightened up and edited for clarity, and also to remove identifying information (i.e. “Jobs Inc.” is a fictitious name).\nJobs Inc. Announces Enterprise Edition Recruiter Suite\nBrings the benefits of the leading jobs marketplace to large Enterprises.\nLONDON (Business Wire) — December 1, 2016 — Today, at the annual Human Resources Professional Association (HRPA) trade show, Jobs Inc. formally announced its new offering designed to bring the benefits of its industry leading jobs marketplace to large enterprises.\n“It’s been so frustrating to us in the HR department because we could see all these great candidates on the Jobs Inc. marketplace, but it was very hard for us to get those resumes and candidates in front of our hiring managers,” said Joyce Rose, VP Human Resources at Bayer Pharmaceuticals.\n“In large enterprises, we have special needs regarding applicant tracking, compliance, verification, hiring and onboarding, and while there are several systems available for the enterprise, none of them gives us what we need most, which is access to the right talent at the right time.  With the Recruiter Suite from Jobs, Inc. we finally have the solution we’ve been hoping for,” says Liam Mueller, Chief People Officer at Siemens.\n“We were persuaded to move into serving the Enterprise because of the many hiring managers that have been using our jobs marketplace over the past years. As their company grows, or they move to a larger company, they have been asking us to provide them the benefits of the Jobs Inc. Marketplace, yet in a solution that meets the demanding needs of the Enterprise,” said Jobs Inc. Founder and CEO, Teresa Holmes.  “But we know that providing an effective solution for the Enterprise is not easy, and we did not want to announce this offering until we had several large Enterprises running successfully with this new offering.”\nTo attend a webinar with HR leaders from enterprises that are already using the new Recruiter Suite solution, please register at www.jobsinc.com.\nAbout Jobs Inc.\nJobs Inc. is a leading provider of an employment marketplace for employers and job seekers.  We have helped millions of job seekers to find the right job for them, and have helped tens of thousands of employers to find the best candidates.  Learn more at www.jobsinc.com. \nInternal FAQ\n1. Many companies that serve small and medium-sized businesses have failed in their attempts to move to the Enterprise.  What makes you believe we can be successful?\nWe consider this the primary risk.  We know enough to know the needs of enterprises are substantial and varied.  We don’t know enough to know if we can be successful.  \nTo address this risk, we intend to utilize the Customer Discovery Program (CDP).  We are working now to select between 6 and 8 prospective Enterprise customers.  We plan to engage directly and intensely with them in order to determine precisely what we will need to do to provide them a solution that they will buy, use successfully, and find enough value to serve as a reference.\nWhat we can say at this point is that we have a strong signal for demand.  Our business development colleagues have provided us with more than 30 strong prospects, and we have already spoken with enough of them to believe that they have a real need for our offering.  The pool of job candidates on our marketplace is not something that others can easily replicate, and the Enterprises are very motivated to get access to these candidates.  The question will be around the quality and effectiveness of our solution.\n2. Our current go-to-market strategy is direct-to-employer, and now you are proposing a direct sales model.  Have you considered the costs and challenges of introducing this new sales channel?\nThe product development costs are only part of the total costs that will be required to address this market.  We believe that this market requires a direct sales channel (an assumption we will be validating with the CDP), and between the costs of sales staff, and the marketing that is required to support the sales channel, we expect this to be substantial.  \nTo address this, we are including a dedicated product marketing manager (PMM) starting immediately as a full-time member of the new Enterprise Tools Product Team.  The PMM will work closely with the product team to understand the sales cycle, the customer’s purchase process, the onboarding considerations, and the necessary sales tools.  \nFurther, we have already engaged with Finance to make sure we have a full understanding of the various sales and marketing costs that need to be considered.\n3. Enterprises are already asking about professional services.  Will we be required to provide professional services in order to onboard a new enterprise customer?  And who would pay for this work?\nOne of the major unknowns, and an immediate goal of the CDP, is to get a deeper understanding of the various systems that these enterprises need us to integrate with.  We are already focused on their Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and their Human Resources Management System (HRMS).\nWhile there are many of each system on the market, there are a small number of market leaders, and this is one of the factors in selecting the CDP members.\nFirst we need to determine what level of integration, if any, is required.  Next we need to determine if this integration is something that can be done by the HR staff (which would be ideal), or by the company’s IT department (less ideal but viable), or by the vendor’s professional services organization (definitely not ideal), or if our sales or services team would be required to do this work.\nOur strong desire is to not require any professional services in order to get a new Enterprise customer operational.  However, the question of optional professional services is an open one.  Our goal with the CDP is to understand the actual needs, and then this would be a strategic decision for our company’s leadership to make once we have the data as to whether we want to offer these types of services.\n4. How long will it take to onboard a new Enterprise customer?\nThis will be a function of the answer to the above question.  Our strong desire is that a new Enterprise customer should be able to get operational very quickly (less than 48 hours) but that optional additional customization might come after that.\n5. What is to prevent other companies from offering the same Recruiter Suite capabilities?\nWhile there is nothing to stop a competitor from copying our functionality, our major competitive advantage is the marketplace itself, which of course is not easy to replicate due to network effects and the strong brand we have developed among both job seekers and employers.\n6. What is the expected pricing?\nOne of the important questions that the product marketing manager is planning to address early on is pricing.  The CDP program will provide a half-dozen actual enterprise customers that we will be engaging with to ensure the product provides the necessary value, and pricing will be a necessary part of that discussion.\nDuring the CDP program, we will be evaluating the value and the cost savings, as well as discussing potential pricing with the leaders of sales, marketing, finance and the CEO.\n7. Are there legal/contractual concerns and how are they being addressed?\nAn initial conversation with legal has already alerted us that some large Enterprises have specific ideas about who owns the rights to candidates, which will need to be clearly established when using a marketplace where employers essentially compete for candidates.\nWe plan to discuss this with the legal counsel of the CDP candidates to understand if this is an issue for them or not.\n8. What are the major areas of our product technology that you anticipate being impacted, and what do you consider the major risks to be?\nBeyond the new capabilities expected by the new Enterprise Tools team, we can already anticipate significant work being needed by our reporting team (to support enterprise reporting), and our billing team (to support corporate invoicing).\nOur intention is to align the goals of these two teams closely with the Enterprise Tools team.\nBeyond this, we expect that as we engage deeper with the CDP customers, we will likely identify additional areas of necessary work, but if and when we have accomplished the goal of the CDP program (six live, referenceable enterprise customers), we will have uncovered and addressed the important unknowns.\nIf we encounter something during this work that is not something we believe we can realistically and immediately address, we will raise this to leadership.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/example-prfaq/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925762219,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Examples -

Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tBy Marty Cagan and Jon Moore\nNomenclature Note: “Senior Leaders” refers here to CEO, Founders, CFO, COO, CMO, CRO, President, etc.  “Product Leaders” refers to the managers and leaders of product management, product design, and engineering.\nNow that EMPOWERED has been published, we’ve heard from a growing number of senior leaders that realize they have been leading through command and control and/or micro-management, and have seen the level of motivation and innovation that generally results from that model, and seem to genuinely want to change in order to empower their people and teams.\nOf course we love hearing that, and the people in the product organization love hearing that too, but changing to an empowered product-team model represents a major cultural and behavioral change, and much of this change necessarily needs to start at the very top.\nUnfortunately it’s not as easy as saying “just back off and give the people space to do their work.”\nThere are very real needs that senior leaders have in order to responsibly and effectively run the company.\nAnd in order to push decisions down to product teams, those teams need to understand the strategic context, much of which needs to come from the senior leaders.\nSo there’s no question that we need frequent high-quality engagement.  It’s just the nature of the interactions that we’re talking about here.\nWe want to interact in ways that provide the leaders the information they need to run the business, yet empowers the product leaders and the product teams, and provides the environment the product teams need to do good product work.\nINTERACTION PRINCIPLES\nWe’ve found there are a set of interaction principles which can help guide constructive and effective interactions between the senior leaders, and the product leaders and product teams:\nLead With Context Not Control.  We want to push decisions down to the product leader or product team in the best position to come up with the best answer – normally that’s the people working directly with the enabling technology, and the users and customers.  But teams can only make good decisions when they are provided the necessary strategic context.  So senior leaders and product leaders need to share the broader context – vision, strategy, financials, regulatory developments, industry trends, partnerships and more.\nOutcomes not Output.  Whenever possible, we want to hold people accountable to outcomes rather than output.  But this only works if the people are empowered to come up with a solution that works.  We want to give product teams as much latitude as possible to come up with the best solution they can.\nKnowing What You Can’t Know.  It’s important for everyone – but especially senior leadership – to understand that with technology products, there are many things that we simply can’t know in advance.  Knowing what you can’t know, and admitting what you don’t know, is essential for strong product organizations.\nData Beats Opinions.  The great equalizer in strong product organizations is the ability to run tests and collect data.  We teach product teams how to run tests quickly to collect the necessary evidence or even proof.  Product teams use this evidence to resolve differences among themselves, and with their leadership.\nHigh-Integrity Commitments. It’s also important for the product leaders and product teams to understand that there will be times when the business needs to know a specific date for a specific deliverable, and the organization needs to be skilled in the techniques for coming up with high-integrity commitments.  That said, the senior leaders also need to understand that the need for high-integrity commitments should be the exception and not the rule, and that the time and effort in making a high-integrity commitment is non-trivial.\nThe Main Thing.  As Jim Barksdale famously said: “The main thing is to keep the main thing, the main thing.“ So much of an effective product organization is a result of real focus.  There will always be new prospective customers, and new business opportunities, but remember that focus is not saying no to bad opportunities, it’s saying no to other good opportunities.\nMissionaries not Mercenaries.  Effective teams of missionaries depend on three critical ingredients: the teams must be staffed with competent people with the necessary skills; the people need to be inspired with the strategic context; and the leaders must demonstrate some trust in their product leaders.  Nobody is expecting a blank check, but if you want people to take ownership of outcomes, good people need some space to do good work.\nTransparency.  It is very important to the culture of the entire company that the product and technology organization be as transparent as possible with their reasons for the decisions they must make.  This not only means sharing the rationale, but also the successes and failures.  We will often have colleagues and stakeholders in the company that disagree with specific decisions, but we never want them to question the integrity or motivation of the product organization.\nYou Are Not The Customer.  In any organization there will be many people that have strong opinions, but strong product organizations need to concentrate on coming up with solutions that our users and customers love, yet work for the business.  Many people will think they are representing the customer, and that is an especially dangerous trap for founders, product managers, designers, and sales and services staff, but there is no substitute for going to the true users and customers.\nFix The Team First.  When a problem is identified, first we focus on ensuring the right team is in place to successfully address the problem.  That may mean ensuring the necessary skill sets are on the team, or coaching one or more members on specific skills, or when necessary, correcting staffing issues.\nEmpowered Engineers.  This principle is a little different than the others but it’s such an important point that we encourage all senior leaders and product leaders alike to constantly keep a focus on this.  You want to make sure that in every decision that you make regarding product, that your engineers are truly represented, engaged and empowered.  You want to ensure that your individual contributor engineers are used for more than just coding, and they are actively participating in product discovery as well.  They are consistently the best source of true innovation, but that’s only if they’re truly empowered, and not just there to implement features conceived by others.\nIdeas vs Directives.  Senior leaders need to be very cognizant of the power of their words, especially when engaging with individual contributor product managers, designers and engineers.  Senior leaders are constantly exposed to many customers and prospects, and many industry trends, and it is not unusual for these senior leaders to get inspired with many different ideas.  In a healthy product organization, product teams want to hear these ideas.  But they need to know when it’s simply an idea to be considered and possibly explored, or when this is literally a senior leader exercising his or her prerogative to issue a directive.  Unless explicitly stated as a directive, all discussions about product ideas are assumed to be just ideas to be considered, along with many others from several valuable sources.  During their product discovery work, the product teams will test out many ideas in order to discover a solution that works.\nPrototype vs. Product.  When we are communicating about product with senior executives, we need to be very clear whether we are talking about something that is being explored in product discovery (prototypes), or whether we are discussing something that is now live and in production and visible to customers (products).  When getting feedback on proposed product ideas, we use prototypes, and we do that before building.  When we’ve already built something, and we’re now communicating the new capabilities to sales, customer service, marketing, customers, etc., then we use the live product.  Confusing these two can be very dangerous.\nMinimize Surprises.  Sometimes surprises are unavoidable, but we try hard to minimize them.  This means that if there’s anything even potentially sensitive, the product manager is expected to recognize this, and to show and discuss (typically with a high-fidelity prototype) with the impacted senior leader(s) before the solution is built.  One of the worst forms of waste is when a product team builds a product quality, scalable implementation of some capability, and then finds out afterwards that there is some reason why this is not an acceptable or viable solution.  This is the same reason we test usability and value with the target users before building.  Similarly, if a senior leader reviews a prototype during discovery, and doesn’t raise any major issues, but once the product is built and in production decides that something is a serious problem, then this is likewise very wasteful and frustrating to the organization.  Regardless of the cause, when something gets built but then is deemed to have a serious problem, it is reason to have a post-mortem discussion to see how that type of waste can be avoided going forward.\nNo Silver Bullets.  Finally, be aware that there will always be a constant stream of bright new shiny things when it comes to books, articles, processes, techniques, and methods.  Design Sprints, OKR’s, Jobs To Be Done, Hack Days, Opportunity Solution Trees, and countless other techniques all have their place, but it’s essential for everyone to realize that none are silver bullets.  There is no real substitute for the hard work of product.\nCertainly there are any number of potential types of executive engagement, but in terms of the interactions regarding product and technology, my hope is that these principles can provide a foundation for senior leaders and product leaders alike to understand the needs and concerns of the other.\nGreat products require strong product teams and strong leadership, so it’s essential that the organization has constructive and effective communication and interactions.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/executive-engagement/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925836306,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Famous Product Managers - Silicon Valley Product

In a few cases these people also helped build the initial product but mostly not.\nInterestingly, none of these leaders went to business school, and several of them didn’t even finish college. But they all had an intimate understanding of an underserved market, a passion for finding a better solution, and a deep knowledge of emerging technologies and how they might be applied to their respective problems.\nAll of these product leaders possessed great empathy for the customer, insight into what was possible, and the ability to see what was essential and what was incidental. They had a deep understanding of the customer as well as their own team’s capabilities. They operated from a strong basis of knowledge and confidence. They defined products that could be executed with a strong effort.\nI don’t believe that any of them would say they were “market-driven” in the sense that it is typically used today. They didn’t go out and gather customer requirements which then told them what to build. But they did, in a very real and meaningful sense, spend time with and get to know the people that would become their customers.\nWhile none of them may have had an MBA, none were pure technologists either. Rather, these were very technology savvy people that saw how they could apply what they knew to solving real problems for real people.\nI believe that there are many valuable lessons to be learned from studying these famous product managers. When I look at what they did to create the products that formed the basis of their companies, and then I look at what most companies do to create new products, the differences are striking and many.\nFor starters, most high-tech products today are created one of two ways. Either the team essentially builds what their customers tell them to, or they let their engineers “innovate,” and then the team productizes what they come up with. I’ve written elsewhere about these very common pitfalls (see www.svproduct.com/papers/toppmmistakes.pdf) but I think it’s useful to contrast this with the approach of the product leaders above.\nIn future articles we’ll look at this and other fundamental differences between the most successful product managers and how most people practice product management.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/famous-product-managers/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925795221,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"From Projects to Products - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nTalking about product culture can sound very theoretical, but it impacts everyone every day.  To try and bring these principles to life, here is an example of a very common before and after.\nIn the old models, it is very common that everything is about building projects by certain dates.\nIt’s understandable where this comes from, as the IT department is constantly asked for specific features and projects delivered as fast as possible.\nThe problem is that this ignores the realities of technology-powered products.\nProjects are typically large, slow and expensive attempts at delivering some output by a specific date.  We have to decide how big the team needs to be, and guess how much time it will take, and then we need to try to get funding for the effort, and invariably we learn that there is more work required than you first expected, so there’s a real crunch to finish.  \nMost efforts lose all hope of providing real value, and just try to get something shipped.  Then as soon as they do finally ship, it’s not like they can iterate to improve the product.  Instead, the people usually scatter off to their next assignments; nobody owning the outcome, and any important learnings from the effort likely lost.\nThere are so many things wrong with this.\nFirst, it normally takes several iterations, based on learning from the prior iterations, until we achieve the necessary results, but we rarely get funding for more than the first attempt, and even if you do, it’s usually multiple quarters later.\nSecond, we need the people to feel real ownership of the technology and the outcomes, but with projects where people are assigned to an area just for the duration of the project, there is very little ownership, and there’s little incentive to worry about building something impactful.\nThird, it’s all about delivering the features and projects that the stakeholders are asking for, rather than allowing our product team, especially the engineers, to look at what’s just now possible.  The result is that any form of innovation is exceptionally rare with projects.\nFourth, because teams just build what they need to for that project, there’s no one to worry about the longer-term impact of this work, or improving the underlying technology, so tech debt rapidly accumulates.\nFinally, who takes responsibility for driving to the necessary outcome? Any sense of ownership is usually dispersed among multiple stakeholders, and the most likely consequence is to blame the project team for doing such a poor job.\nIn contrast, with the product model, we focus on products and outcomes.  \nA product team focuses on business outcomes, like reducing churn rates, or improving growth, or whatever the relevant KPI’s are for your situation, and the product team is constantly working to monitor and improve those results. The capabilities they add are all intended to drive those results.  They are obsessing over the outcome.\nPartly this is about changing to durable product teams focused on business results, but partly this is a cultural change where a team is asked to be accountable to outcomes, and not just shipping features.\nIn the project model, the best you can really ask for is time-to-market.  But in the product model, you can focus on the much more impactful time-to-money.\nWhat is especially ironic is that you might think that a time-to-market project at least would get done faster than a time-to-money product team would achieve an outcome. But so often it is just the opposite.\nWhile the project team has to staff up, learn the necessary technology, establish the necessary relationships, and understand the necessary context, a product team is already operational, and has likely done many similar projects and features already. So, in addition to being up to speed on the technology, they know much more about both the problem and solution space, they know the data, and they know how to work as a team to tackle a problem.\nThis is why far and away the most waste we see is in companies running in the old project model.\nNone of this is to say that time-to-market isn’t important. It is. And speed matters. And we do have solid techniques when a date we can count on is the priority. \nThat said, the heart of the matter is the question: What is more important for this effort? Hitting this date? Or accomplishing this outcome? I’d be the first to say that sometimes the date is the priority. But I also believe that this is the exception and not the rule.\nIt’s easy to see why so many companies may talk about the importance of outcomes over output, yet their culture and behaviors consistently prioritize predictability over results.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/from-projects-to-products/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925969193,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Getting Past The Gatekeepers - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tReaders of my articles know that I believe that the single most important thing that a product manager does is to get his ideas in front of real target users. This is where real learning happens, and this is where you can discover a product that customers love.\nHowever, there are some environments where there are people that effectively try to prevent you from engaging directly with the end-users. I have written earlier about how critical this is that you get this direct engagement when you have a company trying to prevent this (see the SVPG article “Can’t Talk to Users?”).\nBut in this article I wanted to talk about two specific situations. The first is where your own marketing organization wants to be the gatekeeper, and the second is where your customers want to designate specific people to “represent” their end-users (often from their IT organization).\nIn a very real sense, these boil down to the same situation. Someone thinks they are in a position to represent your users. This occurs most often with with companies that sell to large enterprises, but can occur almost anywhere.\nFirst and foremost, you need to be totally clear in your own mind how absolutely essential it is that you get in front of the actual end-users. If you are not completely convinced of this you won’t be able to convince your colleagues or customers (see the SVPG article “Prototyping Testing” for a discussion of this).\nSecond, you need to make very clear to these “gatekeepers” that this need to go directly to the end-user is nothing personal against them. Instead this speaks to a fundamental limitation of software and people. Just as you are not able to represent the end-user, neither can they. There are several reasons for this, but usually you are all far too close to the problem and too knowledgeable about the area, and you are all likely early adopter types, but the bottom line is that you are not your customer (see the SVPG article “Eating Dog Food”).\nThese people can help you greatly by facilitating the introduction to the actual target users. The marketing people often have good data on who the end-users are and where to find them. The representatives at the target customer companies have the access necessary to locate and schedule the sessions you’ll need.\nBy all means include these people during your interviews and user testing. They can help you to interpret what you see and these learnings will help them greatly in their jobs as well.\nI can’t emphasize enough how essential it is to get this direct end-user access. It really is ridiculous to suggest that a great product can be designed without this.\nIf you give it your best shot and you are still locked out, then the path is different depending on the case.\nIf the problem is in your own organization, then one way or another you’ve got to get your marketing leaders out of the stone age. I saw a report recently from the Institute for the Study of Business Markets where they took old-school marketing to task:\n“Companies suffer from a “depth deficit” for failing to think deeply enough about customers…our marketing teams have an abundance of superficial insights…what we also have in abundance are vacuums of real thinking which the teams gloss over by adding still more superficial thinking to our knowledge base…understanding what customers really need as organizations and individuals persists as the premier challenge – a fundamental obligation of business marketing still unmet…blamed marketers’ over reliance on rudimentary research techniques. Companies need to go beyond traditional market research to gain inherent product and process understanding…There’s a proven, more basic approach to customer understanding, however, although too few marketers roll up their sleeves, get their hands dirty and study how customers actually use their products.“ (see “B2B Marketing’s Balancing Act” by Ralph Oliva and Bob Donath).\nIf the problem is that your customers representatives won’t allow access, then you can recruit target end-users directly, just not necessarily from the exact customers you want. You can find several examples of this sort of recruitment today on Craigslist. You’ll need to screen the candidates but in most cases you can find people that really are from your target users.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/getting-past-gatekeepers/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925967954,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Great Products Are Not Just the Product Guy's Job - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI recently asked the founder of a startup what he most wanted to know about marketing. He said, “What’s the best way to get publicity without feeling spammy?”\nHe’s actually done it already: build a great product customers love. His Read-It-Later IOS apps and browser plug-ins have quietly amassed 3 million users.\nBuilding a great product worthy of conversation is generally thought to be the product manager’s job. My partner, Marty, writes extensively on how. But if you’re in product marketing, you should contribute as well.\nEven though we all know a great product is the foundation of evangelism, it’s easy to forget the responsibility of getting there is shared. Many companies are guilty of “product” guys figuring the product out, then handing it over to “marketing” to tell the world about it. Part of a product marketer’s job is to get involved during the product’s planning and ensure it passes these simple tests:\nIs this something other people will talk about if we’re not directing the conversation?\nWill people like this enough to tell a friend even if they’re not incentivized to do so?\nDo we create legitimate opportunities to share value others want?\nTake Dropbox. The product guys did an outstanding job of solving a real problem, nailing a killer UE, and focusing on the backend to make the experience as simple and seamless as possible. A quick scan of any thread about Dropbox’s popularity confirms:\nMake it just work + Make it dead simple = Product Love\nBut here’s how Dropbox also passes the above three tests.\n(1) Even people not in technology have heard of Dropbox—whether or not they use it—because their tech savvy friends fearlessly recommend it. Dropbox isn’t controlling all these conversations. They’re happening organically because excited fans find new reasons to tell others about Dropbox because it solves real problems, is easy, and works well.\n(2) Dropbox’s word-of-mouth marketing is often cited as a key to its success. Although their engineered virality was brilliant, it misses that people refer clients, parents and friends to Dropbox regardless of whether or not they benefit from it.  AppStore ratings are another great example of this—ratings influence conversion, yet people write them despite no reward.\n(3) Too often, the product solution to marketing is adding a ‘share’ button, social media integration, or enabling referrals. None of this works without something people genuinely value and are motivated to share.  Think about the stories you want your customers to tell in a review. What makes them wildly enthusiastic? What makes someone act because of what they read?\nIt is not “data stored in the Cloud” or “fast cross-platform performance.” What matters—as proven by Dropbox, Pandora, Craig’s List, and the iPad—is when something is as easy and works as well or better than we hope. It surprises and delights. This is the promise of all technology but rarely achieved. When a product actually delivers, people talk about it.\nThat said, even if you have a great product, encouraging authentic dialog—the key to publicity that doesn’t feel spammy—is work. Be realistic. Make yourself relevant to other peoples’ agendas. When Friendster, the online service that originated social networking, had its initial exponential growth, its founding engineer did all its PR. He sent tech writers his week-over-week growth. At the time, no one had seen anything like it before, so it was a new trend those writers could report on.\nProduct marketing must be managed on many fronts: search-engines, app stores, social media, web presence, pundits, the blogosphere, or a salesforce. There is no silver bullet.  The right mix for any given company is different based on goals, target audience, stage of adoption, where and when people hear messaging, context, reviews, and what people click on when they inevitably google.  The telltale sign you don’t have the mix or product right is when your marketing effect is only directly proportional to how much you spend.\nThe point is: if you want great marketing, make sure you’re starting with a great product. It’s key to the enthusiastic evangelism every product needs. And that is not just the product guy’s job.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/great-products-are-not-just-the-product-guys-job/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925937862,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"How Not To Coach - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNearly all of my articles are written as a form of coaching.  I’m trying to help product teams and product leaders become better at product.\nEvery once in a while, a good “teachable moment” comes along, and I try to use that to highlight where something could have been done much better.\nIn this article, that teachable moment is unfortunately coming at my own expense.\nRecently I published a pair of articles that were trying to highlight root causes of some very problematic behaviors – the first talking about the CSPO pathology, and the second talking about the MBA pathology.\nBoth were pretty critical articles, but that wasn’t the problem.  The CSPO-focused article was fine; the issue was with the MBA-focused article.  And even there, the problem wasn’t with the message itself.  The problem was with the way that message was delivered.\nMy SVPG Partner Chris Jones published an article a couple of years ago that talked about the necessary coaching mindset, and that article evolved to become one of the foundational chapters in the book EMPOWERED.  In the chapter, Chris talks about the necessary foundation of trust.\nThe problem with the MBA pathology article was that it opened by putting those in need of coaching immediately on the defensive.  And many people just couldn’t get past that.\nIn fact, since that article was published, I talked to several people that told me they read the article, yet they couldn’t cite even a single one of the coaching points, and didn’t seem to catch that I continue to actively recruit out of top MBA programs.  \nOnce they saw in the opening that Elon Musk said to avoid hiring MBAs, nothing else I said mattered.\nIn contrast with the MBA article, in the CSPO article, the criticism was aimed at the “instructors” that have never done the job before, and the product managers were the victims of these people.  So the article was trying to coach those product managers and their managers in what to look for to avoid these pitfalls.\nBut in the MBA article, the people intended to be coached were those with an MBA that might need help overcoming some common misconceptions when they enter the product world.  \nWhat the article should have done was simply point out that everyone has areas they need to be coached on, and for those that come via an MBA path, there are four areas that are often important to look closely at.\nWhen I wrote that article, I was not in that necessary coaching mindset that Chris described.  I remember my mindset at the time because I had been asked my opinion of one of the top MBA programs in the world, and after looking into the specific curriculum of what was supposed to be a course aimed at future product managers, I was disappointed and more than a little frustrated to find such antiquated views persisting.\nBut of course, my audience is not MBA faculty, so I was directing that frustration at the wrong people.\nIn any case, I’m hoping those of you that are product leaders and responsible for coaching and developing your people can learn from my mistake, and keep in mind the necessary coaching mindset.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/how-not-to-coach/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925804384,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love - 2nd Edition - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tHow do today’s most successful tech companies—Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Tesla—define, design and develop the products that have earned the love of literally billions of people around the world?\nPerhaps surprisingly, they do it very differently than the vast majority of tech companies.

Now.”\n— Phil Terry, Founder, Collaborative Gain; co-author, Customers Included\n“Marty and Chris have written the definitive book on product leadership. Their emphasis on coaching as a key leadership skill and the detail on how to do it well, makes EMPOWERED a must-read for new, aspiring, and experienced product leaders alike.”\n— Teresa Torres, Product Discovery Coach, Product Talk\n“INSPIRED motivated a generation of product managers to build products customers love, and EMPOWERED is the blueprint leaders need to transform their organisations and empower their teams to deliver on that inspiration.”\n— Martin Eriksson, Co-Founder, Mind the Product\n“If you’re leading product people or even the whole product organization of your company, this book is for you. It’s the first book to outline the underlying philosophy behind stellar product organizations from a leader’s perspective, and its many examples make it easy to understand these concepts and apply them in your company’s environment.”\n— Petra Wille, Product Leadership Coach\n“EMPOWERED is a must-read for product leaders in the same way INSPIRED is unquestionably the most influential book in tech product management.”\n— Felipe Castro, Founder, OutcomeEdge\n“This is the missing guide to product leadership. It gave me the tools, mindset, and practical insights to excel in my role. I fully expect to come back to this book on a recurring basis – as I do with INSPIRED. EMPOWERED needs to be on the shelf of all product leaders and aspiring product leaders.\n— Gabrielle Bufrem, Manager of Product Management, VMware\n“EMPOWERED dives deep into the tough organizational and cultural issues that get in the way of most companies I work with today. This is the experience and advice I’ve been waiting for in one book.”\n— Jeff Patton, Product Process and Design Coach\n“EMPOWERED is full of actionable straight talk for anyone looking to understand how the best product teams operate.

LOVED’s Introduction to get a taste of the book. \nForeword for LOVED\nIn INSPIRED, I argued that the single most important concept in all of product is the concept of product/market fit. \nFor startups, achieving product/market fit, including and especially the go-to-market strategy for that product, is really the only thing that matters.\nBut the reward for reaching product/market fit is growth, and growth brings its own challenges.  \nMoreover, as the company grows, we typically evolve our product to address the needs of additional markets, and usually we soon begin work on new products as well, so the critical concepts of product/market fit and growth remain at the heart of product work for the life of a technology-powered company.\nINSPIRED described the techniques we use to discover a product that is valuable, usable, feasible and viable, and the book discussed how this requires an intense collaboration between product management, product design, and engineering.\nBut while discovering a winning solution may be necessary, it is not sufficient.\nWe have all seen countless examples of products that go nowhere because:\nthe product doesn’t address real customer needs\nor, there aren’t enough customers with those needs\nor, those customers do exist, but not enough of them learn your product exists\nor even if they do find you, they don’t see how what you provide aligns with their needs\nTo avoid this fate, as the name implies, there is another dimension to product/market fit, and that is the market.\nWhen we talk about a winning product, we are referring to a strong solution for a specific market.\nA product manager’s partner in achieving product/market fit and getting this product to market is the product marketer.\nWhile the product manager focuses primarily on the product side of the equation, the product marketer focuses primarily on the market side, including the go-to-market strategy.\nBut it’s important to realize that pursuing the product and pursuing the market are not independent activities.  They are happening in parallel, and they are very much intertwined. \nWhich is why the product manager / product marketer partnership is so important to get right. \nI have always visualized this partnership as the product manager working with the product marketer to triangulate on product/market fit.\nAnd once we achieve product/market fit, and our focus moves to growth, the collaboration of product and product marketing becomes the key to that growth.\nWhile the product marketing role has existed for many years, for technology-powered products and services, with the pace of innovation, and with very crowded competitive landscapes, it is especially challenging, and more important than ever.\nAt a strong tech-powered product company, the product marketer helps to answer some very fundamental questions essential for a product’s eventual success:\ndetermining the best way to reach the target customer\nhow and when the customer will be able to learn your product exists\nhow to position your product so the customer knows how to think about your product\nhow to message the value so that it resonates with the customer’s underlying needs\nhow the customer can evaluate your product\nwho and how will the customer make a buying decision\nfinally, if you’ve done your job well and the customer loves your product, how can they tell their friends and colleagues how much they love your product\nMany experienced product leaders will tell you that getting the go-to-market right is as tough as discovering a successful product.\nIn truth, in our books and articles to date, we know we have focused primarily on the product side of the equation. \nThat’s mainly a result of our product bias.  We know there are examples of products that succeeded despite weak product marketing, but great product marketing can’t overcome a bad product.\nHowever, in our increasingly competitive reality, in order to succeed, we need both strong products and strong product marketing to succeed.\nWhich is why I’m happy to tell you about this new book.\nMartina has had a remarkable career, with many years of experience at top tech companies, most notably Microsoft and Netscape Communications, covering not just product marketing, but also product management and corporate marketing.  She is, I believe, uniquely suited to write this book.\nMartina has worked for, and been coached by, several of our industry’s most accomplished technology and marketing leaders.  As a long-time SVPG Partner, Venture Capitalist, and UC Berkeley Lecturer, she has been advising, coaching and teaching literally hundreds of companies, and countless product marketers on the critical topic of product marketing.\nIn some cases, especially at early-stage startups, the product manager may need to cover the product marketing role as well.  In other cases, others in the marketing organization may need to cover the role.\nWhether you are coming from the product side or the marketing side, you are much more likely to succeed if you have a solid understanding of product marketing.\nIt is the goal of the SVPG series of books to share the best practices of the top product companies, and this is an important addition, addressing a long-underserved need.  \nAnd our intention is that this is just the start.  We plan to do more going forward, sharing more of the best practices and techniques helping product teams and product marketing to collaborate effectively and successfully.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/introducing-loved/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925824324,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Jackie Spanswick - Silicon Valley Product

Some of my current favorites include: Leaders Eat Last, Startup Nation, The Art of Action, Turn the Ship Around, Extreme Ownership, Team of Teams, and Leadership is Language.  I consider each of these inspiring and worth reading.\nThe reason Chris Jones and I wrote EMPOWERED was to help these leaders understand how strong product companies put these principles into practice in their product and technology organizations.\nThose that follow our writing know that at SVPG, we try to share the practices of the best product companies.  One of the challenges in doing that is that we need to untangle the practices as they relate to product, from the cultural characteristics that are more of a reflection of the personalities of the founders.\nRecently, the co-founder of Netflix, Reed Hastings, published a book sharing his philosophies on the advantages of empowering your people.  The book is called No Rules Rules, and it’s the newest addition to my list of favorite books on the empowerment topic.\nFull disclosure that I have been a very long-time fan of Reed, and then Netflix – their products and their culture.  I profiled their original product manager in INSPIRED.\nReed and I both started our careers as engineers in an applied research lab, then we each started companies working on products for other engineers, and then we each moved to the consumer internet.\nI mention this not to put myself in the same league as Reed (I’m not), but just to point out that I share many of his same biases and opinions, especially regarding the harmful effects of too much process, and command and control style management.\nOne of Netflix’s mantras is “lead with context and not control,” and this is a great summary of the leadership style that I was taught as well.\nMy favorite story in the book is when Reed describes a situation where one of his managers made what he considered an awful decision.\nReed sat down with the manager, and asked him why he made the decision he did, and Reed realized that the manager had made a very reasonable decision based on the information he had.\nThe root cause of the bad decision was that Reed and his senior leadership team had not shared enough of the context so that this manager would have been able to make a good choice.\nIf you want to see what a company that sets the “empowerment dial” to 10 looks like, this book does a good job.  It is definitely provocative, and some people will likely be uncomfortable with a few of his positions, but it will certainly give you a lot to consider.  I will tell you that my experiences with the people that work at Netflix over the years is that it’s not as brutal as may come across in the book.\nKeep in mind that some of the practices companies do are there more to define the culture than to drive behavior.\nAs it applies to a product and technology organization, leading with context takes real effort to do well, and it’s a major responsibility of your product leaders.  But if you want to empower your product teams and push decision making down to the people closest to the problems and the enabling technology, then it’s well worth your time.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/lead-with-context-not-control/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925954235,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Learning Fast vs. Failing Fast - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Development\n\tDecember 13, 2017\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tBy SVPG Partner Chris Jones\nAt this point, nearly everyone in product at some point has heard phrases like “fail fast” or “embrace failure”. Though they are a bit tired, the intent of these phrases is still good: many product organizations are stuck in conservative patterns where they do little more than optimize on their tried and true ideas, while sensational phrases like “embrace failure” direct attention to breaking out of that pattern.\nThe problem with this phrasing is that it robs us of the opportunity to call out the behavior and mistakes that truly need to be corrected. In the worst case, lumping together the concepts of risk taking and preventable mistakes leads to sloppiness.\nWe need to reclaim the concept of failure and redeploy it to cover our inappropriately cut corners, bad decisions, and preventable mistakes. A prototype that falls flat in user testing is not failure, but releasing a product with a foreseeable security flaw is. An A/B test that shows no improvement in customer retention is not a failure, but shipping a product that failed to account for a critical facet of the customer’s’ workflow most definitely is.\nAs for breaking out of the very real problem of overly conservative product development, I prefer the framing suggested by Tom Chi.  Tom talks about breaking out of a culture of “right and wrong” or “success and failure” and replacing it with a culture of “learning”. Instead of praising the ideas that work and condemning the ideas that don’t, we continually draw attention to the insights we’re gaining along the way. Regardless of whether an idea was successful or not, we celebrate what we learned in getting to that point.\nProduct discovery is where most of this learning happens. Its techniques are all optimized to get to insights as quickly and inexpensively as possible, much more so than the techniques used for creating delivered product.  Where product delivery is about creating the product we are confident in shipping, product discovery generates the insights that inform what that delivered product should be.\nAdding to the list of genuine failures: shipping a product without doing sufficient product discovery is almost always a failure. So let’s focus our attention on learning and save “failure” for the really bad stuff, like not learning.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Discovery\n\tJuly 10, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Risk Taxonomy\n\t\n\tOne of the questions I get quite frequently has to do with the different risk taxonomies for product teams that...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Discovery\n\tSeptember 20, 2022\n\tJon Moore\n\t\n\t\n\tChanging How You Solve Problems\n\t\n\tBy Jon Moore and Marty Cagan This is the second of a three-part sequence on defining transformation.

Lipstick on a pig is when product marketing tries to make the best of a bad situation. The metaphor may be a bit harsh, but the message is clear.\nLife can be very hard for the product marketing manager that is trying to convince people to buy and use a pig. I actually know people that revel in this particular challenge; they view product marketing of a good product as not enough of a challenge. I personally prefer to ensure we build a good product in the first place.\nThe book “Purple Cow” by Seth Godin makes a very similar point from the marketing perspective (and stays in our farm animal theme too).\nThere are far too many examples of “lipstick on a pig” in the high-tech world. You’ve all seen them. But to illustrate my points, I’m going to pick on a product from a company that I truly admire – Macromedia. Macromedia is a terrific company, with some of the best product managers and product leaders out there, and with what I consider a very progressive and effective product development process. I think Adobe is in for a pleasant surprise when they realize that in addition to several great products they also acquired some outstanding people and an innovative development process. But even in great companies there will occasionally be bad products.\nThis story, however, starts not with a Pig, but with a truly great product from Macromedia – Flash. Ever since the advent of the Internet and browsers, there was a clear need for richer, more interactive user experiences that ran across the different browsers, operating systems and computers, with the goal of being able to write it once, and run it anywhere. This was of course the big goal of Java too, but for a number of reasons this never happened for Java on the desktop, but it did happen with Flash. Virtually every browser has a Flash plug-in installed, and you are probably using sites with Flash every day and you don’t even realize it because it’s fast, seamless, and well integrated with the rest of the web page. If you need a rich experience beyond the abilities of HTML, you’re probably using Flash.\nHowever, while Flash does a superb job for the end user, it can be more than a little tedious for developers to create Flash components, especially if you want to use Flash heavily or if you have a lot of data to manage. Macromedia heard this from their customers, and they realized there was a product opportunity there. Their answer was a product called Flex.\nInitially the Flex product was marketed at a very wide range of applications. The sales force was aggressively positioning the product as the next generation way to create rich interactive web sites. Unfortunately, they had a problem. The product was a pig. Very slow, buggy, inflexible design, and the end-user experience was awful. Many developers liked and appreciated the development model and how much easier it was for them to write the applications, but the end user paid the price (or wouldn’t, as the case may be).\nThe first symptom of the problem was a mismatch between the types of companies the product was being positioned to, and the actual referenceable customers. It’s hard to get a consumer internet service to commit to a new deployment technology without being able to point to at least a few that are already successfully using that technology. Of course, as we’ve discussed before, it’s the job of the product team to ensure that at product launch there are several marquee customers already successfully running your product and referenceable.\nThe second symptom of the problem was that Macromedia was clearly hearing about the performance complaints because their product site became very defensive, featuring categories such as “Tips and Techniques for Improving Flex Application Performance” and “Is Macromedia Flex the Right Fit for You?”.\nThe third symptom was a focus on the developer benefits with barely a mention of any end-user benefits. While it’s great to speak to the developer community, you can’t ignore the people that matter the most.\nThe Flex marketing folks did what they could to adjust the positioning and address the objections, but fundamentally they had a tough job because the product just didn’t measure up.\nIn fairness to the Flex product team, it is possible that this product was never intended for the market it ended up getting sold to. Sometimes the marketing team and sales force take whatever they have to the customers they know best. But in this case the lesson may be that it doesn’t do any good to simply wish you had a different product – you must be able to deliver on your promises.\nBut Macromedia is a great company with smart people, and I have little doubt they will get the product in shape. We can all learn not just from Macromedia’s outstanding products like Dreamweaver and Flash, but also from the occasional mistake.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/lipstick-on-a-pig/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925881664,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Market Fit - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Martina Lauchengco\nThe Market Side of Product/Market Fit\nI see so many companies find an initial beachhead of customers, think they have product/market fit, and then find their growth stalling. It’s never about just one thing. But it’s often because not enough attention was paid to market fit. Discovering the product and its market aren’t independent activities. They are discovered in parallel.\nWhen I say market fit, I mean discovering ‘market pull.’ What makes a customer need or want your product enough that they take immediate action to learn more, try, or buy? And what makes this pattern repeatable?\nBeyond a product’s usability, feasibility, and viability, product discovery work around value is intended to find this answer. Although it is the most difficult and important risk to probe, it tends to be underdeveloped.\nPeople say they will use or buy a lot of things, which is easy to confuse with product desirability. Not all tests and techniques are equal in placing decisions or actions into a realistic enough market context.\nDetermining market fit is about taking inputs from discovery work and applying them to what people are likely to truly do in real-life conditions. How will they act when confronted with a crowded market, competing priorities, limited budgets and a status quo that works well enough?\nValue discovery work must probe beyond “would you buy this, would you buy it from us, and how much would you expect to pay for it?” Assessing market fit requires probing more deeply on market conditions that motivate action or create urgency. Sometimes it can be how a product is distributed. Often, it starts with how a product is talked about and its messaging.\nI see many companies struggle with how to take what they’re learning and understand the market implications. It is why a product marketing partner is so important in this work. Good product marketers can apply more market nuance to doing and applying discovery work and understanding how it applies to all things go-to-market.\nThey catch things like segmenting customers for who might be better evangelists and not just looking at initial users of a product. Or how actions might be more influenced by word-of-mouth from what is read on a comparison site or on Reddit than an actual trial product experience.\nSynthesizing all this learning into a smart product go-to-market plan, positioning and messaging is the work of product marketing. But it’s important that strong discovery work happens to inform all of it.\nProbe Early, Probe Often\nTraditional market research from analysts, third-parties, and trend reports is always good context, but nothing beats live customer conversations for understanding market context.\nDiscovery work led by product managers should always cover product baselines:\nAre your customers who you think they are?Do they really have the problems you think they have?How does the customer solve this problem today?What would be required for them to switch?\nThe market fit side of the equation explores what lies underneath perceived value. It probes market dynamics affecting what people think, what drives growth, and what creates urgency.\nThe below questions don’t need to be asked all the time—nor are they the only ones that might be appropriate to ask–but the collective discovery work done should answer these more market-oriented questions.\nValue\nWho is most likely to use this? Who buys it? Who influences decisions?Do they prioritize the problem?What else are they considering that is similar?What have I said/shown you that is most compelling (‘a-ha’ moment)?If probing relative urgency: if you had 10 points in your budget to allocate to solve your most urgent problems, how many points would each get?If probing pricing: how much would you expect to pay? Maximum price willing to pay? What else have you recently bought at this price?What new product have you most recently bought and why?\nGrowth / Connection\nWhat created curiosity?How would they describe this to a colleague? (crucial for messaging insight)Where would they expect to see this product talked about?How would they expect to assess it? What would make them a raving fan?Is there any line of sight to the next most likely market segments to adopt? Do they feel the same sense of urgency? What market situations are necessary for them to act?\nAny product discovery technique that engages directly with customers can be adapted to inform this work–from prototypes to usability tests to A/B tests to the Sean Ellis test. I also advocate using simple market test techniques that give quick, directional feedback and illuminate how people think, feel, and most important, act.\nHere are some examples of discovery techniques and how to use them to probe market-fit dynamics:\nExit surveys. For users who immediately exit a website, use any number of tools to pop-up a one question survey “Is there anything we could have done differently to make you stay?”A/B messaging test. There are many tools that make it easier to test and optimize product descriptions or text on websites. When you do A/B testing of messaging, don’t just pay attention to what performs better. Ask what the relative performance differences tell you about market perception. Are you positioning yourself in the best category or into the right market trend to be valued?Demand test variation. On a website where a click leads to a landing page demand test, ask only for some sort of buy or trial commitment. This separates the curious from those actually willing to take meaningful action. You must be transparent on the state of your product (if it’s an idea versus an existing product) but you can still ask “Why did you decide to buy” right on the page in addition to asking if people are interested in follow-up.Ad testing. Great for messaging or seeing engagement on social or search platforms. I recommend testing vastly different directions, for example, aspirational, product or problem-oriented messages. You’re not trying to optimize which is best, rather you’re trying to learn what direction gets people to act and what their relative performance tells you about the market.Sentiment probe. Take a baseline sentiment measure (use a seven or ten point scale) on interest for your product, problem, or space. Then show a video–your product, a competitive product, an ad, a brief explainer video–and measure sentiment with the same question after the video to see if there is any shift in interest. If there is, ask those who shifted why.Usability test variation. In addition to what you normally probe, include key competitors website(s) to watch users navigate through and ask what actions they would take next. Another variation is watching people search for your product or one like it in the space. This helps you understand a more complete customer journey as opposed to just your product’s in isolation. It’s better at shedding light on what people are likely to do as they explore a problem and the space in which your product operates.\nI encourage people to be creative and get out of the building to really understand market fit. That’s where a lot of big ‘a-ha’ insights happen that might affect product go-to-market.\nThis is excerpted from LOVED: How to Rethink Marketing for Tech Products.

people can figure out how to use it; and we can deliver it when we need it with the resources available – also known as valuable, usable and feasible.\nI love the concept popularized by Eric Ries of the smallest possible experiment to test a specific hypothesis, but I refer to that that as an “MVP Test” so that people don’t confuse an experiment with a product.\nIt helps to always keep in mind the point of these MVP Tests, which is to get to this notion of Product Market Fit.  That’s when we actually have a viable product.\nBut beyond the definition, it’s equally important to recognize that it’s not enough just to think you have achieved Product Market Fit (which is what most product owners do – it’s their opinion), you need to have evidence that you have this – we call this validated customer learning.\nFurther, I define product discovery as the process of how we utilize MVP Tests to hopefully achieve Product Market Fit.\nWhile my definitions above hopefully sound straightforward, I still get many questions from product teams about this critical concept:\nHow do we rapidly converge on an Product Market Fit?\nHow do we know we have actually achieved Product Market Fit?  What level of “proof” do we need?  How many customers need to agree to buy it?\nIs the MVP Test intended to be something that we sell, or is it just an experiment?\nIf it’s something we intend to sell, what if a customer won’t buy it?  Does this mean it’s not Product Market Fit?\nWho is responsible for discovering Product Market Fit?\nWho makes the decisions regarding each MVP Test?\nHow long should we keep trying to achieve Product Market Fit before we give up?\nWhat should we do when we identify a pivot opportunity?\nDo we need to wait until we have identified Product Market Fit before we start building production software?\nIs an MVP Test the same as “minimum product?”\nIs Product Market Fit the same as “product vision?”\nIs an MVP Test the same as MMF (Minimum Marketable Feature)?\nWhat happens after we have achieved Product Market FIt?\nHow do I go from MVP Test to backlog items?\nIs Product Market Fit a moving target?  Can I lose it once I’ve found it?\nIs there only one Product Market Fit for a given market or could there be many?\nDo we handle MVP Tests the same way for products for consumers as we do products for businesses?\nThese are all important questions and I can understand why people can get confused, so I thought I would try to address these with a series of articles.  I’ll do my best to make this abstraction real, so you can see the value and hopefully put this fundamental concept to work for you.\nPlease feel free to send me additional questions and I’ll try to incorporate them in as well.\nNOTE: Updated in January of 2014 to reflect consistent nomenclature (MVP Tests vs. Product Market Fit vs. Product Vision).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tTransformed FAQ\n\t\n\tThis page is here to hold questions and answers that come up once the TRANSFORMED book is published and we...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tAlternatives To Product Managers\n\t\n\tI doubt anyone is surprised to learn that many people have been asking me about Brian Chesky’s recent comments.

Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”\n– General George S. Patton, Jr.\nPatton was quite a character. From what I know of him, it sounds like he would have been quite a product manager. He’s the source of countless quotes and advice, but I wanted to talk about the quote above and how I think it applies to product managers in two very important senses.\nFirst, on the receiving end, customers and users will very often try to tell you as product manager *how* your product should work, rather than *what* your product should do. We all have experienced this, as it’s very much human nature to try to envision solutions to problems. But when a product manager focuses on *what* the product should do it’s pretty amazing how many possibilities open up as to how to best solve the problem.\nI’ve written elsewhere about the underlying reasons why customers and users really aren’t in a position to come up with a good solution themselves. But the bottom line is that there’s a big difference between customer requirements and product requirements.\nWhat I haven’t yet talked about is the other side of this point, where the product manager tells the UI designers and engineers *how* to design and build the product, rather than telling them *what* the product needs to do. This is an especially common problem with UI design (aka product design, interaction design, or information architecture). This problem is exacerbated by the fact that companies typically have too few design resources, and sometimes the product manager is in fact the only person available to do the interaction design.\nUnfortunately, the skills for interaction design are very different from product management, and it’s the rare product manager that’s good at both. Another problem I see that complicates this is that in many companies, the UI design resources are part of a service organization where they’re pulled in “as needed” to help with design after the PRD is complete. The problem here is that this severely limits the contribution of a good designer. They are most valuable very early in the process, when the product manager is working to understand the target market and come up with a solution.\nA product manager that a) has a good appreciation for the role of product design; b) in a company that has the product design function staffed and available; and c) where the product manager gives the product designer the latitude to come up with solutions that meet the needs, has a big advantage in coming up with winning products.\nStrong product/UI designers are hard to find. In my opinion, there are too few good academic programs turning out too few of these critically important people. But when you do find one, be sure to fully utilize her. Make the designer a key part of your product team, and include her in your customer visits, user profiling, product brainstorming, and in deciding your product strategy and roadmap. Let her explore alternative designs and listen closely to her input in terms of user behavior and preferences.\nAll of the above applies with engineers as well. The engineering team doesn’t appreciate the product manager spelling out the details of the implementation any more than the product manager wants the customer to dictate the specifics of the requirements. In my experience, this is somewhat less frequent because the line between product managers and engineers is fairly clear, but when I review PRD’s I find that it still happens a great deal.\nNote that if you want to learn more about product/UI design, a site and newsletter that I like a lot is www.goodexperience.com written by Mark Hurst. Also, one of my favorite books on this topic is “The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How To Restore the Sanity” by Alan Cooper.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/pattons-advice-for-product-managers/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925954635,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Planning Product Discovery - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"Much of product discovery work doesn’t actually require a lot of planning. We need to come up with a solution to a particular problem, and often this is straight forward, and we can proceed quickly to delivery work.  But for certain efforts, this is decidedly not the case, and some planning and true problem solving becomes critically important.  Big projects and especially initiatives (projects spanning multiple teams) are common examples.\nDiscovery Sprints have some planning built into the start of the week, but we don’t do discovery sprints that often as they’re a special tool for an intense effort especially where we need to make a big decision in a short period of time.\nFor the other cases where some planning is called for but not with the time-boxed structure of a discovery sprint, I wanted to talk about how we frame our discovery work to ensure alignment and identify key risks.\nThere are really two goals here:\nThe first is to ensure the team is all on the same page in terms of clarity of purpose and alignment.  In particular, we need to agree on the specific problem we are intending to solve (also referred to as “job to be done” if you prefer that nomenclature), which user or customers you’re solving that problem for, and how will you know if you’ve succeeded.  Not accidentally, these should align directly to your OKR’s.\nThe second purpose is to identify the big risks that will need to be tackled during the discovery work.  I find that most teams tend to gravitate towards a particular type of risk that they might be most comfortable with.  Two common examples I find is that a team will immediately proceed to tackling technology risks – especially performance or scale.  Or, the team may zero in on usability risks.  They know this change involves a complex work-flow and they’re nervous about that so they want to dive in there.\nThose are both legitimate risks, but they’re far from the only risks, and at least in my experience, those are often the easier risks to tackle.\nWe must also consider value risk – do the customers actually want this particular problem solved, or is our proposed solution good enough to get people to switch from what they have now?\nAnd then there’s the often messy stakeholder risk where we have to make sure that the solution we come up with in discovery actually works for the different parts of the company.  Here are some common examples of that:\n– Financial risk – can we afford this solution?\n– Business development risk – does this solution work for our partners?\n– Marketing risk – is this solution consistent with our brand?\n– Sales risk – is this solution compatible with our go to market strategy?\n– Legal risk – is this solution something we can legally actually do?\n– Ethical risk – is this solution something we should do?\nAgain, for many things we won’t have concerns along these dimensions, but when we do, it’s something that we need to tackle aggressively.\nIf the product manager, designer and tech lead do not feel there’s a significant risk for any of these areas, then normally we would just proceed to delivery, fully realizing there’s a chance the team will occasionally be proven wrong.  However, this is preferable to the alternative of having the team be extremely conservative and testing every assumption.  We like to use our discovery time and validation techniques for those situations where we know there’s a significant risk, or where members of the team disagree.\nThere is a very rich example of this in the news of late.  You’ve no doubt all heard of the fake news problem on Facebook.  Imagine you’re on a product team tasked with tackling this very difficult problem.  Certainly there’s very promising technologies, such as natural language processing, and machine learning more generally, that may be able to help.  And that’s what most people are talking about right now, but there are some broader issues as well:  Who gets to define truth?  Is it even appropriate for Facebook to take on that role?  And how does all of this mesh with Mark Zuckerberg’s product vision?  Are there freedom of speech concerns (real or perceived)?  How does this get reconciled with different cultural norms around the world, and even censorship?  What are the financial implications of restricting monetization on news stories?  What are the sales channel implications?\nThese are all very real risks that will substantially impact any proposed solution.  This gets to the heart of what makes product difficult, and why tackling these risks in discovery is so critical to coming up with solutions that work not just for your customers, but for your company as well.\n","url":"https://www.svpg.com/planning-product-discovery/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925834725,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Platform Product Management - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tOne of the most difficult – but highest leverage – types of product management is to define successful platforms. By platforms, I am referring to foundation software that is used by application developers to create end-user solutions. Examples include operating systems (e.g. Windows, MacOS, Palm OS), operating environments (e.g. Java, Flash), Web services (e.g. Amazon’s or eBay’s integration API’s), and game developer platforms (e.g. XNA).\nBefore I go further, it’s important to point out what is not a platform. There are too many so-called “platforms” out there that are really just unfinished products. The team didn’t do the work required to provide a complete solution, so they market it as a platform and push the work off on the customer or a developer to finish. If you don’t have multiple commercial software products or services built upon your software then you’re not a platform in the sense I’m describing.\nBut assuming you are, then you know how difficult platform product management can be. To begin with, there are three very different constituencies:\n– The application providers are the businesses that choose to use your platform to build their solution.\n– The developers work for the application providers and they write their software using your platform services.\n– The end-users are the ones that run the application provider’s products and ultimately use your services.\nEach of these three constituencies brings very different needs and requirements. You simply can’t be a successful platform without meeting the key needs across all three.\nThe application provider is going to be concerned with business viability – their viability if they use your services, and your viability in case you go out of business or discontinue support for the platform. The application provider cares about your pricing, licensing, quality, support, and global availability, among other factors.\nThe developers are looking for services that make it easy for them to quickly create maintainable, reliable code in the languages they want to use, working with their favorite tools and infrastructure, on the devices they need to deliver on.\nThe end-users care mainly about the end result. If the features and services they want aren’t there or don’t work in the way they need, they don’t buy the application, which means the application provider fails, which means you lose a customer and eventually you fail too.\nOne of the biggest mistakes that platform product managers make is in the prioritization of the three constituencies. The developers are the most vocal group and the easiest for the company to relate to, so they usually get considered first. The application provider is the one writing the check so they come close behind. But the end-user is often so far removed from the platform provider that they rarely interact directly. Unfortunately, this is precisely the reverse of what’s needed. It is a big (but common) mistake to optimize for developers over the end-user. It is ok for the developers to work a little harder if the application is something the end-users like and use, versus making the developers happy but nobody wants the end result.\nCountless platform-wannabees made this mistake. The reasoning is very simple: I’m a developer; I know what other developers want; so I’ll create something to help both my colleagues and myself. I would have to include Client-side Java in this camp. Great development environment; terrible user experience; terrific opportunity for Macromedia.\nMany extremely successful platforms have been downright awful for the developers. But they succeeded because of compelling value to the end-users and therefore to the application providers. You don’t have to look further than early Windows for an example of this.\nI’m not advocating platforms that make life miserable for developers, but product management is all about choices and priorities, and it’s essential to understand that the delivered application is what matters the most.\nThere are other important dimensions to platform product management that make this area challenging. For example, there are many different delivery models (e.g. embedded, private-label, co-branded, hosted) and many forms of customization that may be required (e.g. end-user, customer’s IT, solution provider/SI, vendor, source-code). Each of these is an article in itself.\nSupport is also very difficult for platform providers. The bar is high as you’re a critical dependency for all of your customers. That said, the great thing about working on platforms is that they’re very high leverage and if you do it well you can create a thriving ecosystem where you and your application provider partners succeed together.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/platform-product-management/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925941920,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Pledge To Executives - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nNote: As a company moves from top-down, command and control models of leadership to pushing decisions down to empowered product teams, there are some important changes to how the product leaders and product teams need to interact with executives, and it’s important that product teams realize this requires changes on both sides of the equation.  This is a follow-up article to Pledge to Stakeholders and Pledge To Customers.  \nMoving to the product model often requires significant cultural change, especially when moving from top-down, command and control styles of leadership.\nMostly when we discuss the necessary changes, we focus on the changes needed within the product and technology organization.  However, an important aspect of transformation is changing the dynamics and interactions between the senior executives and the product organization.\nIt’s true that many product leaders and product teams would like to think this is as easy as saying “please just back off and give the product teams space to do their work.”  \nUnfortunately, there are very real needs that executives have in order to responsibly and effectively run the company.\nAnd in order to push decisions down to product teams, those product teams need to understand the strategic context, much of which comes from the executives.\nSo, in contrast to reducing the level of interaction, product teams need frequent, high-quality engagement.\nWhat we’re really talking about is the nature of these interactions.\nWe hope to interact in ways that provide the executives the information they need to run the business, yet empowers the product leaders and the product teams to do the work they are capable of.\nWe’ve found there are a set of techniques which can help encourage constructive and effective interactions between the executives, and the product leaders and product teams.\nDECISIONS\nOne of the central ideas behind the product model is to push decisions down to the product leader or product team that is in the best position to come up with the best answer – normally that’s the people working directly with the enabling technology, and directly with the users and customers.  \nBut teams can only make good decisions when they are provided the necessary strategic context.  So, it’s critical for executives to share the broader context – the business strategy, financial parameters, regulatory developments, industry trends, and strategic partnerships.\nProduct teams depend on the executives to share as much of the relevant strategic context as possible so they have the information to make good decisions.\nAnd executives depend on product leaders and product teams to share openly and honestly the data and reasoning used to make their decisions.\nOUTCOMES \nProduct teams understand that what matters is results.  Whenever possible, product teams expect to be accountable to outcomes rather than output.  \nBut this only works if the product teams are given a problem to solve (rather than a particular potential solution to build) and then empowered to come up with a solution that works.  \nIn order to come up with the best solution they can, product teams depend on executives to provide as many degrees of freedom to solve the problems they’re assigned as possible.\nProduct teams then pledge to take responsibility for coming up with a solution to the problem, and make best efforts to solve for the customers, solve for the business, and solve for the technology.\nDISAGREEMENTS\nProduct teams realize that the executives have the broadest access to data, and the best understanding of the wider business context.  Yet the product teams have access to the enabling technologies, and to the actual users and customers interacting with the products every day.  \nProduct teams realize that at times there will be differences of opinion.  In the old models, contrarian or counter-intuitive ideas are not explored and innovation rarely happens.  In the product model, it is very often these counter-intuitive insights that power real innovation.  If something is important, we coach product teams on how to run tests quickly and responsibly to collect the necessary evidence, or even proof.\nThe product teams depend on executives to allow for and ideally encourage teams to explore alternative approaches when they believe that’s necessary to succeed.\nIf a product team is proposing an approach with associated risk, the product team pledges to responsibly run product discovery tests in order to collect the necessary evidence, and then share those findings.\nPROMISES\nThe product teams understand that there will be times when an executive needs to know a specific date for a specific deliverable.  The product teams pledge to treat these promises as high-integrity commitments.  \nThe product teams understand the damage that is done to an organization when promises are made and then not kept.\nProduct teams ask that only the product team that will be responsible for delivering on a promise be the one to make that promise, and they not be asked to make a promise or deliver on a commitment where they don’t know what is involved and what would be required to succeed.\nFurther, product teams depend on high-integrity commitments being the exception and not the rule, as the time and effort in making and then delivering on a high-integrity commitment can be significant.\nBut once a promise is made by a product team, they pledge to then take these high-integrity commitments seriously, and do everything within their power to deliver on their promises.\nFOCUS\nAs Steve Jobs famously said: “Focus is saying no to the hundreds of other good ideas.”\nSo much of an effective product organization depends on real focus.  \nThe product teams understand that the world changes, there will always be new prospective customers, new opportunities, and new threats, but depend on the executives to strive to stay focused, at least on a quarterly basis.\nSURPRISES\nProduct teams realize that surprises are sometimes unavoidable, but they also know they must try hard to minimize them.  This means that if there’s anything even potentially sensitive, the product manager is expected to recognize this, and to show and discuss with the impacted stakeholder or executive before the solution is built. \nOne of the worst forms of waste is when a product team builds a product quality, scalable implementation of some capability, and then finds out afterwards that there is some reason why this is not an acceptable solution.  \nSimilarly, if an executive reviews a prototype during discovery, and doesn’t raise any major issues, but once the product is built and in production decides that something is now a serious problem, then this is likewise very wasteful and frustrating to the organization.\nThe product teams pledge to preview any potentially risky solution with the relevant executives prior to building.\nRegardless of the cause, when something gets built but then is deemed to have a serious problem, it is reason to have a post-mortem discussion to see how that type of waste can be avoided going forward.\nTRUST\nThe product teams understand that empowerment depends on a degree of trust, and they pledge to work to earn that trust.\nLikewise, the product leaders and product teams are trusting that the executives are leading the company in a positive direction.\nNeither expects the other to be perfect, but they each recognize that they depend on the other, and pledge best efforts to help each other succeed.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/pledge-to-executives/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925892237,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Pledge To Stakeholders - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nNote: As a company moves from stakeholder-driven feature teams to empowered product teams, there are some fairly significant changes to how the product teams need to interact with stakeholders, and it’s important that product teams and especially product managers realize this requires changes on both sides of the equation.  This is a follow-up article to one I wrote a few months ago: Pledge To Customers.  \nAn empowered product team is designed to solve problems for our customers or our business, in ways that our customers love, yet work for our business.\nWe define a stakeholder here as someone not explicitly a member of a product team, yet represents a key constituency, area of the business, or special expertise.\nCreating a solution that customers love is usually not that hard (assuming the product team has direct, unencumbered access to the users and customers, and the product data).\nBut creating a solution that the customers love and also meets the many, often competing needs of the different parts of the business, can be very challenging.\nWe need to ensure our solutions can effectively be marketed, sold, and serviced.  We need to ensure we can fund the product, and we can effectively monetize that product.  We need to be able to operationalize the product.  We need to ensure the product is compliant with relevant regulations, respects privacy laws, partnership agreements, and does not have unintended consequences on people or the environment.\nWe know we can’t do all this alone.\nBut we also realize that to create any product, there will be literally hundreds if not thousands of decisions that will need to be made.  Bringing all the relevant stakeholders together for every decision is not only an excessive use of time and money, but we also know that committees very rarely innovate.\nThat’s because stakeholders are not working directly with the enabling technology (just as our customers are not), so they are not in a position to know what’s just now possible.  It is this combination of enabling technology with real customer problems and real business constraints that produces innovative products.\nWe also recognize that in order for a stakeholder to build a respectful, trusting relationship with a product team, the onus is on the product leadership to ensure that every product team has a competent product manager that has put in the work to understand the various constraints of the business, and to be an effective partner to the stakeholders.\nExpecting stakeholders to trust a product manager that does not have this foundation is not only unrealistic, but also unwise.\nOn the other hand, even though product managers are on the product team to represent these various business constraints, very few product managers know all of the relevant business dimensions in sufficient depth.\nTherefore, a product team’s pledge to stakeholders is that each product manager commits to engaging directly with each of their relevant stakeholders, and working to learn and understand the various constraints and needs represented by each area.\nFurther, product teams realize that it takes time to build this knowledge and this trust, so whenever they are considering a solution that might impact a particular stakeholder, that product manager pledges to show a prototype of the proposed solution to the stakeholder, so that they can consider the implications of this change before the team builds anything.\nHopefully, if the product manager has correctly understood the various constraints, this only takes a few minutes for the stakeholder to take a look and give a thumbs up.  \nHowever, in the event there is a problem, the product team can quickly iterate on the prototype until the stakeholder believes the solution will now work for the business.\nSometimes this will be easy, and other times getting a solution that works not only for customers, but also for multiple stakeholders each with different needs, may require many iterations to identify a solution that solves for all parties.  And even then, the solution that solves for all parties may end up being something that none of the stakeholders realized was possible.\nMore generally, the product manager pledges to work towards the desired business outcomes. The product teams know that shipping features won’t necessarily solve the underlying problem for the customer or the business. The product team is committed to pursuing the necessary results.\nBut the pledge is to not build – and certainly not to ship – any solution that does not meet the critical needs of the business.\nIn the event that something does manage to get built, or worse, to ship to customers, that is not viable for the business, the product team pledges to correct the situation as quickly as possible, and to determine how the error occurred so that it is not repeated.\nThe product managers pledge to be respectful of your time, and to earn your trust.  They also pledge to be transparent.  Stakeholders are welcome and encouraged to participate in testing with users and customers.  They are welcome to take a look at any of the prototypes created.  They are welcome to view the data on the product – both how the products are used, and the results of live data tests.\nWorking together, product teams and stakeholders can solve problems for our customers and our company in ways our customers could not have imagined possible.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/pledge-to-stakeholders/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925826907,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Podcasts Archive - Page 2 of 3 -

But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing.  This can happen very easily in large organizations.”\nI’ve already written about the serious problems that result when you take a process role, like a product owner, and ask them to cover a product job, like a product manager.  I’m not trying to repeat that argument here.  Rather, I’ve come to realize that the problem goes well beyond product owners.\nIn many companies, the latest trend in this dangerous direction is the rise of product ops.\nNow it’s important to acknowledge that there are several very different definitions of product ops out there today (this overview article describes several of them including the helpful and valuable definitions), but unfortunately one of the most common definitions is to have a person, or in many cases, an entire team of people, that exist to provide the process, tools and methods for the broader product organization.\nIn order to understand the pros and cons of this, let’s step back a second.\nFundamentally, as organizations grow, there are two main ways today that organizations attempt to scale.  \nOne is by scaling their leaders (the managers).  The other is by scaling their process.\nI’ve written an entire book about how companies scale with strong product leaders.  But here I need to talk about the alternative: attempting to scale with process.\nIf you’ve read my writing, you already know I have very strong feelings about the problems with scaling with process, especially the so-called “Agile at Scale” processes.\nBut I’ll admit to mixed feelings about the people in these process roles.  \nI am convinced that the vast majority of the people I meet in these roles have good intentions.  They sincerely want to help their companies.\nBut in practice, they often cause far more harm than good.\nWhy is that?\nFirst, I can’t help but notice that so many of these process people have never performed either the maker role or the manager role in a strong product company.  They have more enthusiasm than experience or knowledge.  Not only does this put exactly the wrong people in control of how teams work, but these people are prime targets for the armies of consultants and vendors that have figured out that these people are their best path into your company.\nSecond, in many cases, these process people are hired because the managers are not willing or able to do their job – especially in terms of coaching and developing their makers.  If that’s what’s really going on, then that is the problem that must be fixed.  A process person is a very poor substitute for a strong manager with the necessary expertise.\nThird, process is a lot like religion.  People get fanatic about their favorite processes, and it’s very difficult to reason with a fanatic.  (As a side observation, my theory is that since these process people aren’t makers or managers, they tend to have more free time than the rest of us, and many tend to spend a good portion of that time on social media preaching their particular religion).\nAnd finally, if you believe as I do that there is no one right way of doing product, then the very notion of standardizing a process across a large organization just means that you’ll be institutionalizing a process that will be a poor fit for most teams.\nAt the risk of over-generalizing, I’ve seen the product owner problem taking root in Europe, and the product ops problem taking root in the US, but both stem from what I consider a misguided focus on process as the means to scale.\nIn every strong product company I know, the key to scale has been their leaders.  In particular, their managers, and the commitment of those managers to coaching and developing their makers.\nI certainly understand the attraction of scaling with process, and the hunger for a framework or some form of “recipe for success” at scale.  But that’s just not the reality in good companies.  The truth is that product leadership is hard, but necessary.\nSo what to do if you are a leader at a product company?\nI’m suggesting that you consider very carefully your mix of makers, managers and process people.  \nYour makers are the ones discovering and delivering your products so you clearly want the focus there.  Your managers are the people that will need to coach and develop these makers to success, so they are your key levers.\nConsider very carefully each process person you hire, and realize that you are choosing to fund a process person over another engineer, designer or product manager.  \nMake sure their purpose and contribution is clear, and that they are not there to try to make up for managers that aren’t willing or able to coach and develop their people.\nNOTE: I received several questions after this article so I addressed them in a follow up article.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/process-people/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925921737,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Process People Continued - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my last article, I talked about how one worrisome trend I am seeing is so-called “process people” using the vehicle of product ops to penetrate an organization, and take an otherwise useful function in a less than useful direction.\nThe feedback I received was mainly people reporting that this is unfortunately very much what they have also witnessed, but there were also people that were confused by what I was trying to say.\nPartly I think this was because I tried to cover too many different points in that one article, but partly it is because there are so many different definitions of “product ops” out there and people read the article from the perspective of their own definition.\nI first started getting asked by companies about product ops roughly three years ago, and one of the things I quickly learned was that my definition was not the same as what many (in truth, most) of them were using.\nSo now when I’m asked about product ops, I start by asking them how they are defining the function at their company?\nI have so far identified at least six distinctly different definitions of the product ops function.  And many companies have different combinations of these definitions. \nI don’t yet know if this taxonomy will prove to be useful or not.  I had hoped by now to see more consolidation of the definition.\nI also only have anecdotal evidence, mainly from my, and my SVPG partners, discussions with more than a hundred companies, and from reading articles from a wide range of authors, so I only have a rough sense of most prevalent vs least prevalent.\nOne thing for sure is that the term is new enough and general enough that it is very easy for people to either inadvertently or intentionally define the role to suit their purposes.\nMy intention is to write more about these various definitions, and explain which ones I think can truly help an organization, and which ones are just old problems reappearing under a new name.\nBut in this article, I want to double-click on the specific overarching point I was trying to make in my earlier article.\nLet’s put aside for a moment the issue of the many definitions out there, and instead look at just one of the more prevalent definitions, which is to have some number of people dedicated to improving the productivity and effectiveness of at least the product managers.\nThis would be around standardizing the tools, methods, practices, training, and onboarding of the product managers.\nAt smaller companies, this is normally squarely the responsibility of your manager(s) of product management.  It’s a good portion of what the managers are coaching their people on.  \nBut in larger companies, there is definitely an argument to be made that there are economies of scale to be had by consolidating this work.\nNow, as you might imagine, this need is not a new revelation.  We have had large product organizations for more than 30 years.  And seeking more efficient and effective ways of solving problems is pretty much the core competency of good product people and product leaders.\nSometimes the managers of product managers would discuss this, and agree that one of them would take the lead on these responsibilities.  In fact, I was one of those people at two of the companies I worked for, which I doubt is a surprise to anyone.\nBut the most common way I have seen this addressed at strong companies is with a principal product manager (or other senior individual contributor product manager).\nFor those that haven’t heard of a principal product manager, it is generally the most senior individual contributor level for a product manager.  \nThese people usually have zero desire to become a people manager, but they deeply love the craft of product, and are motivated by taking on the toughest challenges on the most critically important product teams.\nThese people are also highly compensated, and while they may not manage people, they are usually well known in the company for their willingness and ability to help provide advice and coaching to less experienced product people.\nSo when the goal is to share the best practices of the best product people, these principal product managers would often be the obvious answer.  \nYou certainly wouldn’t ask your most junior product manager to do this, right?\nYet in so many companies that have been setting up this function, the people with this responsibility are not principal product managers, but rather Agile Coaches, or project or program managers.\nNow it’s very important to emphasize that I know some absolutely excellent Agile Coaches, and especially those that are Discovery Coaches, and also excellent project/program managers, and your company would be very lucky to have these people no matter where they are in the organization.\nBut I’d encourage you to go ahead and look at the LinkedIn profiles of most people with the title “Agile Coach” and see how much actual first-hand relevant product experience you find.\nThis is the same reason I highlighted the problem of so many product managers being trained by Agile Coaches rather than experienced product leaders.\nThis is what I meant by “process people” trying to fill a product role.\nSo there are really two major dimensions to this discussion.  The first is how your company chooses to define product ops.  The second is who your company chooses to staff that function. \n This article is simply trying to ensure you have your best possible people setting the bar for the broader organization.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/process-people-continued/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925951509,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Process vs. Model - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThere’s an old saying which comes from the world of statistics: “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”  This has always resonated with me.  While conceptual models are never perfect, I find them to be an especially powerful tool for explaining important concepts.  But there is always the risk that someone will take the conceptual model too literally, or project too much into it, and interpret it as a prescriptive process.\nThis occasionally happens when explaining the concepts of continuous discovery and delivery.\nI have long used the conceptual model showing these two activities happening in parallel:\nThis conceptual model actually goes by many names.  In fact, I think it’s an indication of the underlying truth of the model that so many people refer to this model using different terms.\nI’ve seen it referred to as “build the right product / build the product right,” “fake it before you make it,” “build things that don’t scale / build things that do scale,” and “move fast / don’t break things.”  And many people now refer to the model as “dual track agile” or more generally as “dual track product development.”\nJeff Patton published a good article recently covering the origin of the “dual track” phrase.  But even in his article, you can see how Jeff struggles with trying to capture more of the actual processes of discovery and delivery in the conceptual model.  It’s easy for me to see how this simple conceptual model could morph into a complicated process flow chart.\nLots of people over the years have encouraged me to augment the simple conceptual model, to highlight things like:\nthe baseline product vision and/or user research work that is often done in advance of more tactical discovery work\nthe activities to describe the work to be done in delivery\nthe differences when the delivery process in scrum vs. kanban\nthe feedback loop between learnings in production and discovery\n​​​​​​​I’ve resisted all of these suggestions not because any of them are wrong, but because hopefully you can see that this is a slippery slope as it moves from a simple conceptual model to an illustration of a much more detailed specific product development process.\nMore importantly, what I like about the simple model is that it is process agnostic.  There are many different discovery processes and techniques, just as there are many different delivery processes and techniques.\nThe higher order points to me are:\nthe activities of discovery and delivery are happening in parallel, ongoing  – they are not “phases”\nin discovery the team is tackling head-on the big risks – value, usability, feasibility and viability\nin discovery the product team is working collaboratively to solve problems – product management, product design and engineering\nthe product team measures itself against business results and not just shipping features\nit is one product team responsible for both discovery and delivery (obviously product managers and designers spend most of their time on discovery activities while engineers spend most of their time on delivery activities).\nI emphasize to product people all the time that there is no single product discovery process just as there is no single product development/delivery process.  There are many different discovery processes, all for different situations.  For example, a discovery sprint looks very different from customer discovery, but you should be skilled at both.\nMoreover, it’s important to realize that it’s not about process.  It’s much more about putting in place the necessary culture, and training your team on the critical techniques.\nIn his recent (must read) shareholder update, Jeff Bezos spoke to some of these same issues:  “Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right.”\nAs long as you’re tackling the risks up front; truly collaborating with engineering and design on coming up with good solutions; and making sure you are solving the underlying business and customer problem, and not just shipping features, then you’re focused on what you need to be doing.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/process-vs-model/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925763932,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Coaching - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nAt SVPG we believe product coaching is an essential element to creating strong product organizations.  \nIdeally, every manager of product managers, product designers and engineers understands that coaching is their primary and most important responsibility.  However, in many cases, these managers are learning on the job, along with their employees.  In this case, a product coach can be an effective alternative.\nMoreover, many organizations are working to transform to empowered product teams, which requires some significant work from the product leaders, including a compelling product vision, a strong product strategy, and a well-designed team topology.  For those product leaders that have never done this before, a product leadership coach can help them through the creation of these critical deliverables.\nEvery SVPG partner is a product coach.  However, because we are a small partnership, our coaching is largely limited to the companies we advise and have engagements with.  Yet there are many more companies that reach out to us for coaching than we can possibly help ourselves.\nTherefore, we have developed a network of product coaches that we know personally, and believe are effective coaches.  These coaches do not work for SVPG, and we have no financial relationship with any of them.  We simply refer them to others because we think they are good.  \nIf you would like some names of potential coaches, just send us a note with your primary location, and the type of product coaching you are looking for.\nIf you’re not sure what to look for when seeking a product coach, this article can help you get a better idea of the types of product coaches, and what to look for in a product coach.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-coaching/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925829320,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Leadership Is Hard - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tSo many people I meet naively believe that the key to empowering product teams is simply to get the management to back off, stop micromanaging, and give their product teams some space to do their jobs.\nBut as I’ve tried to explain many times, empowered product teams depend not on less leadership, but on better leadership.\nBut what does that really mean?\nWhen I explain what’s truly required to product leaders of feature team organizations in order to move to empowered product teams, they are usually in a state of shock for awhile, as they digest just how far away their current role is from where they need to be, and they start to realize the central role they need to play.\nIn this article, I’d like to try to share a high-level overview of the product leadership role.  As you’ll soon see, to provide you a detailed view would take more than 400 pages.\nBut hopefully, there will be enough to increase your awareness of the role of strong product leadership, and give you an appreciation for just how hard the job is to do well.\nBut before we get into it, a couple of caveats:\nFirst, when I refer to “product leadership,” I mean the leaders and managers of product management, product design, and engineering.\nSecond, for this discussion, I will distinguish between leadership and management responsibilities.  Most leaders have both management and leadership responsibilities, although the percentage of each varies with their level in the company.  Most first-level managers are primarily managing with a little leadership, and senior leaders are primarily leading with much less time spent managing.\nAs legendary CEO Andy Grove said, “What gets in the way of good work? There are only two possibilities. The first is that people don’t know how to do good work. The second is that they know how, but they aren’t motivated.”  Let’s tackle these two in order.\nMANAGEMENT\nLet’s first discuss the management responsibilities, which primarily involve coaching and staffing.\nCoaching\nProbably the most often overlooked element to strong management is coaching.  It is the single most important responsibility of every people manager to develop the skills of their people. \nThis most definitely does not mean micromanaging them. It does mean assessing and understanding their strengths and weaknesses, coming up with a coaching plan, and then spending the quality time necessary to help them improve.\nMore generally, every member of a product team deserves to have someone who is committed to helping them get better at their craft. This is why, in the vast majority of strong tech product organizations, the engineers report to experienced engineering managers; the designers report to experienced design managers; and the product managers report to proven managers of product management.\nThe amount of time and effort you need to spend on coaching depends on the number and experience level of your people, but to set your expectations, it’s normal for first-level managers to need to spend on the order of 50% of your work week on coaching.  And if I need to explain to you why this is the highest and best use of your time, you may want to reconsider the management path.\nAs the greatest coach Bill Campbell said, “Coaching is no longer a specialty; you cannot be a good manager without being a good coach.”\nStaffing\nThe managers are the people we hold responsible for staffing the product teams. This means sourcing, recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, evaluating, promoting, and when necessary, replacing, the members of the teams.\nIf you have an HR function at your company, they are there to support your managers with these activities, but they are in no way a substitute for the hiring manager in these responsibilities.  This is critically important for your managers to grok.\nBecause empowered product teams are predicated on competent product managers, product designers, and engineers, this starts with raising the bar on staffing and coaching.\nYes, taking staffing seriously is hard, and it takes a substantial amount of time and effort, and you’ll likely feel like this is not the product related work you prefer to do.  But as Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says, “Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will be, the single most important element of Amazon’s success.”\nLEADERSHIP\nThere are essentially two main ways that you can lead a product organization.  \nYou can lead by what’s known as “command and control,” which means explicitly telling your people what you need them to do, usually by assigning them a roadmap of features and projects to build.  In this model the leaders and stakeholders are making most of the meaningful decisions, and your product teams (or more accurately, feature teams) are there to carry out those decisions.  Admittedly, this is easier to do.\nThe alternative is that you can lead by empowering the teams, by instead assigning them business or customer problems to solve, and then letting the product teams determine the best way to solve those problems.\nHowever, if you choose to push key decisions down to the product teams, then you will need to provide those teams with the strategic context necessary for them to make good decisions.\nThis is why, for example, at Netflix the mantra is “Lead by context, not control.”\nSome of the strategic context comes from the most senior leaders of the company, such as the purpose of the business (the mission), and the critical business objectives for the year, but the majority of the strategic context comes from the product leadership: the product vision and principles, the team topology, the product strategy and the specific team objectives.\nTo be very clear, these elements of the strategic context are the specific responsibility of the product leaders.  Individuals on the product teams may contribute ideas or insights, and that’s a great sign of a strong culture, but these are ultimately leadership responsibilities.\nProduct Vision and Principles\nThe product vision describes the future we are trying to create, and most important, how the vision improves the lives of our customers. The product vision serves as the shared goal for the product organization. In terms of timeframe, it is usually between 3 and 10 years out.  \nThere may be any number of cross-functional, empowered product teams—ranging from a few in a startup, to hundreds in a large enterprise—but they all need to head in the same direction, and contribute in their own way to solving the larger problem.\nSome companies refer to the product vision as their “North Star”—in the sense that no matter what product team you’re on, and whatever specific problem you’re trying to solve, you always know how your piece contributes to the more meaningful whole.\nMore generally, the product vision is what keeps us inspired and excited to come to work each day—month after month, year after year.\nIt is worth noting that the product vision is typically the single most powerful recruiting tool for strong product people.\nProduct principles complement the product vision by speaking to the nature of the products that your organization believes it needs to produce. The principles reflect the values and ethics of the organization, and also some strategic decisions that help the teams make the right decisions when faced with difficult trade-offs.\nCreating a compelling product vision is a bit different than the other elements of the strategic context.  The product vision is more art than science.  It’s purpose is to persuade.  It is meant to be emotional.  You are talking about how you will improve the lives of your customers. \nYou don’t want so much detail that your teams think it’s prescriptive, but you also need enough detail so people can really understand what you’re trying to accomplish.\nSo while creating a good product vision is not easy, it is worth the effort because a good product vision is the gift that keeps on giving.  So much of what we do derives from the product vision – the architecture, the team topology, the product strategy, and of course your products for the next several years.\nTeam Topology\nThe team topology refers to how we break up the work among different product teams to best enable them to do great work. This includes the structure and scope of teams, and their relationship to one another.\nOur goal with the topology is to maximize empowerment.  We do that by striving for loosely coupled, but highly-aligned teams.\nComing up with an effective team topology is one of the most difficult but important responsibilities for product leaders, especially at scale.  It requires intense collaboration and negotiation between the head of product and the head of technology.  The decisions you make impact the relationships and dependencies between the teams, and what each team will actually own.\nWhen done well, your product teams are empowered with a high degree of autonomy, and they feel a real sense of ownership over their work, and how it contributes to the greater whole.  The teams can tackle hard problems, moving fast and seeing the results.\nProduct Strategy\nThe product strategy describes how we plan to accomplish the product vision, while meeting the needs of the business as we go. The strategy derives from focus, then leverages insights, converts these insights into action, and finally manages the work through to completion.\nMore generally, the product strategy helps us get the most value out of whatever number of product teams we have.\nThe output of the product strategy is a set of business or customer problems to solve (team objectives) that the leaders will then need to assign to specific product teams.\nThe product strategy is where strong product leaders distinguish themselves.  They decide what the focus will be and what it won’t be, and sometimes these decisions are not always popular with other leaders.  They live and breathe the data and insights about the product, and are constantly seeking the points of leverage that power the product strategy.  A strong product strategy can help a small organization outperform much larger competitors.\nUnfortunately there are no easy shortcuts to a strong product strategy.  It requires real time and effort to aggregate and assimilate the data and insights you’ll need.\nTeam Objectives\nIn order to execute on the product strategy, the leaders need to ensure that each product team has one or two clear objectives they have been assigned (typically quarterly), which spell out the problems they are being asked to solve.\nThese objectives derive directly from the product strategy—it’s where insights are turned into actions.\nThis is also where empowerment becomes real and not just a buzzword. \nThe team is given a small number of significant problems to solve – the team objectives.  The team then considers the problems and proposes clear measures of success (the key results), which they then discuss with their leaders. The leaders may need to iterate with their teams and others to try and get as much coverage as possible of the broader organization’s objectives.\nThe litmus test for empowerment is that the product team is able to decide the best way to solve the problems they have been assigned (their team objectives).\nIt takes strong leaders to be self-confident and secure enough to truly empower the people that work for them, and to stand back and let the team take credit for their successes.\nOngoing Evangelism\nThe final critical role of leaders is communicating the strategic context – the product vision, principles, topology, and product strategy—both to the product organization, and across the company more broadly.\nThis requires an ongoing crusade of evangelizing—in recruiting, onboarding, weekly 1:1 coaching, all-hands meetings, team lunches, board meetings, customer briefings, and everything in between.\nThe larger the organization, the more essential it is to be relentless at evangelism, and it’s important for the leaders to understand that evangelism is something that is never “done.” It needs to be constant.\nLead with context, not control.\nAs you can hopefully see, the job of a product leader in a strong product company based on empowered product teams is both very different from the role in a feature team organization, and also much more difficult.\nIf you’ve never before worked in a strong product company, you may benefit from a product coach.  If you’d like to go much deeper into these leadership topics, that is the reason my SVPG Partner Chris Jones and I wrote the new book: EMPOWERED: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-leadership-is-hard/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925787803,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Leadership Theater - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThe previous article on Product Management Theater proved to be quite popular, and I’m grateful for all the positive feedback.  \nBut as expected, some people took it somewhat personally, and pointed the blame at their managers (the product leaders) or at their company’s executives.\nIn my article, I wasn’t trying to assign any blame (other than on misguided product manager training programs).  I was just arguing that no matter your situation, it is always useful for your career, and your company, for you to develop your skills.  \nAnd those with the least skills are usually the most vulnerable.\nThat said, it is true that where you find product management theater, you usually find product leadership theater.  This should be no surprise as strong product managers have usually been coached and developed by strong product leaders.\nBut when I talk to the product leaders, they usually point the blame at their senior leadership (e.g. CEO that does not come from product, an organizational structure and culture that is very top-down, very sales or stakeholder-driven, very date-driven, etc.).\nThere is no question that the senior leaders have an important role to play if you want to move to the product model, and some behaviors may need to change.\nHowever, the surprise for so many product leaders is that they have at least as much work to do.\nIt is truly perplexing how many product leaders believe that once the senior executives change their ways, all will be good. \nThey focus their energy on getting others to change, rather than on changing themselves:\nThey complain about having weak product managers.\nThey complain about not being empowered.\nThey complain about engineers who don’t seem engaged.\nThey complain about having stakeholders that don’t trust them. \nThey complain about CEOs who demand detailed product roadmaps.\nYet, they don’t seem to realize that each of these problems is very much a consequence of their own actions (or inactions, as the case may be).\nIf a product leader is not willing to take responsibility for raising the skill level of her product people, then the product teams will be staffed with people who lack the necessary level of competence.\nWhen that’s the case, who would be surprised if the teams are not empowered?\nWho would be surprised if the engineers act like mercenaries?\nWho would be surprised if the stakeholders don’t trust the product managers?\nWho would be surprised if the CEO doesn’t trust the product leaders?\nMore generally, two important things for product leaders to keep in mind, especially if they wish to embark on a transformation to the product model: first, you have as much ownership as you have credibility; and second, part of your job as a product leader is to change hearts and minds.\nWhile it is true that the executives have much to change to move to the product model, there are even larger changes required of the product leaders.

a consequence of both the good and the bad of the Internet.  \nHowever, for those aspiring product managers that manage to find their way to my writing, I do want to try to give these people a reasonable foundation, so that they can get started in (what I consider at least) the right direction.\nWhat follows is a specific set of topics, in an intentional order, linking to a curated set of articles.\nHow should I think about the product manager job?\nThe article Behind Every Great Product describes the stories of six product managers that were behind six iconic products, and the hope is that you can start to get a sense of the traits and characteristics of strong product managers.\nThe article The Foundation of Product describes the critical role of the product team you would be a part of.\nWhere do great products come from?\nGreat products solve real problems for our users and customers, in ways that our customers love, yet work for our business.  They are enabled by new technologies that make these solutions just now possible.  Learn the backstory behind several successful and innovative products in Customer Inspired; Technology Enabled.\nWhat really is a product?\nThis question sounds easy but there are many layers to this.  Everything starts by understanding the role of the customer, the technology, and your business.  Please read What Is a Product?\nWhat do I need to worry about to ensure a successful product?\nThere are four big risks in every technology product effort.  You need to understand and be concerned with all four, but two of them are the explicit responsibility of the product manager.\nI’m confused.  None of this is anything like what was described in my Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) class.\nIf your engineers are using Agile methods for delivery, then there’s an important administrative role called the product owner, and the product manager needs to cover these responsibilities.\nThe key is to understand that the product owner responsibilities are just a very small subset of the product manager responsibilities.  And now you may be starting to understand why there are so many ineffective product managers.\nSo what specifically am I responsible for?\nAs product manager, you’re responsible for ensuring that what gets built is both valuable and viable.  And to be clear, this is what makes the job hard.  You’ll have no chance unless you do your homework and prepare.  You can learn the product manager contribution here.\nMy manager thinks that it’s not my job to worry about value and viability.  He says the stakeholders and the executives decide what we’ll build, and we are there to “serve the business”  by designing and building the features they need.  What am I missing?\nUnfortunately, it sounds like you may have ended up in a company that hasn’t yet transformed to true, empowered product teams, and you’re still working with feature teams or worse, delivery teams.\nIf your company is using a process like SAFe, and you want to be a true product manager, I’m sorry to say this but you’ll likely have to move to a company that knows the difference and why it matters.\nIf your company is using feature teams, then it’s worth trying to help the company transform.  You should read carefully the differences between these three types of teams.\nYou may have the product manager title, but if you’re spending most of your day doing project management, it’s very likely you’re on a feature team or delivery team.\nHowever, assuming you are working in a modern tech-powered product company, and you’ve been asked to serve in the role of product manager on a true empowered product team, we can get into the heart of the role.\nWhat is product discovery and why is it important?\nIf you’re on a feature team and you’re given a roadmap of features to build, then there’s really no need or room for product discovery.  There’s a little design, and then it’s all about coding.\nHowever, if you’re on an empowered product team, then rather than being given features to build, you’ve been given problems to solve, and product discovery is how we discover a solution that works – a solution that’s valuable, usable, feasible and viable.\nThere are many techniques you’ll need to learn to understand how product managers collaborate with designers and engineers to discover a solution worth building, but for now, it’s important to understand that feature teams deliver output, but product teams deliver outcomes.  And yes, outcomes are much harder.\nWhat about wireframes, prototyping and user research?\nThese are all important, but they are the responsibility of your product designer, not you.  \nThere are two reasons for this.  First, while learning to use the tools of design is easy, learning to be a good designer is anything but easy.  Second, if you spend your time doing the designer role, then who is going to do the product management role?  They are both full-time jobs when done with competence.\nIf it seems to you that there’s significant overlap between the two roles (a very common confusion), then you probably either don’t yet understand what a professional product designer does, or you don’t yet understand what a true product manager does, or both.\nHow do I get up to speed for this job, or as you say, “do my homework?”\nStart by doing a skills and knowledge self-assessment (or better yet, get your manager to help you with this).  The idea of this assessment is to quickly identify your weaknesses – if you think you don’t have any, you should probably think again, because people aren’t born with these skills.\nOnce you know the areas you need to develop, you can create a plan for yourself (or again, better to get your manager to help you).\nTo set your expectations, it usually takes about three months of real work for a new product manager to get to a basic level of competence.  And that’s if you have a strong foundation and an experienced manager coaching you at least weekly.\nWhat’s the most important thing for me to understand if I want my product team to be great?\nFirst, you absolutely need to do your homework as I described above.  Your team is depending on you.  Beyond that, develop a true understanding and appreciation for the role of design and especially the role of engineering in technology-powered products.\nI’m in.  How can I learn more?\nI am biased of course, but I wrote a book for this purpose, called INSPIRED: How To Create Tech Products Customers Love which is all about how strong product teams solve hard problems.  And if your manager doesn’t have the time or experience to coach you, I’d strongly suggest some serious training.\nSurely there must be other important voices that I can learn from?\nAbsolutely there are, and I’ll share some of my favorites below.  But I have no desire to serve as some sort of gatekeeper to good content.  I want you to be able to determine for yourself whether a given author has something to say that can help you or not.  \nIn my experience, if you can develop a solid foundation of the principles of strong product management, then you’ll usually be able to determine fairly quickly the potential value of a given piece of content.\nWith those caveats, these are some of my favorite thinkers about product, and I’ve benefited from each of their writings:\nTeresa Torres \nHolly Hester Reilly \nMelisa Perri \nFelipe Castro \nJeff Patton\nShreyas Doshi\nThere are others as well, including some very smart people I know that are working on publishing their thoughts for the first time, so this list will grow.\nI hope this series of articles have helped you make sense of the product management role on an empowered product team, and I encourage you to continue learning and developing.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-management-start-here/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925787382,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Management Theater - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFair warning that for many of you, this article is going to feel like a heavy dose of tough love.\nI have been warning for several years that delivery team product owners, and feature team product managers are likely going to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were.\nFrom what I can tell, that reckoning has begun.  And I’m expecting that Generative AI will only compound this.\nIn this article, my goal is to help people realize if they are vulnerable, and what they can do to dial up their contributions to their company, so they’re not at the top of the list when the CEO decides it’s time to cut costs.\nSeveral years ago I published Product vs. Feature Teams to try and shine a light on the fundamental differences between the types of product teams, and especially the job of the person with the title “product manager”.  I explained in that article that a feature team product manager was essentially a glorified (and usually overpaid) project manager, and that a delivery team product owner was little more than a backlog administrator.\nYet so many people did not see themselves in those descriptions.\nIf a company tells me they understand the difference between feature teams and product teams, and they still want to operate that way, I don’t try to convince them otherwise.  In fact, I usually explain that this is not something that we at SVPG can help them with, but that there are several other places they can go to for help.  \nAs an example, when feature team product managers ask me about training suitable for their role on a feature team, I often direct them to one of the many product management training programs for companies working in the feature team model.\nOne of the most popular of these programs summarizes the product manager role as “40% communication and coordination, 20% design, 20% engineering, and 20% business.”\nHopefully you recognize that this is describing a project manager and not a product manager.\nIf you tweak a few words (e.g. “you should know enough about design, engineering and business to talk to designers, engineers and stakeholders”), that could literally be the job description for a technical project manager.\nCertainly this is nothing at all like what is needed from a product manager on an empowered product team.\nNow don’t get me wrong, a good project manager is a valuable member of a product organization.  But it’s not hard to see how a strong tech lead, product designer, engineering manager or program manager could cover this role.  \nAnd you can certainly see why people despise the “product manager as CEO of a product” description when we’re talking about someone like this.\nAnd if you are a CEO that is looking to cut costs, wouldn’t you rather cut this, than lose a hands-on designer or engineer?\nThe reason I describe this as “product management theater” is because a person that is essentially a project manager, with no real training or skills to cover the true product management responsibilities, simply declaring they are a product manager, is just pretending.  \n“Big hat, no cattle.”  It’s theater.\nRealize that there are situations where layoffs are unavoidable and there’s really little if anything any of us can do to protect ourselves, no matter what type of product team you’re on. However, in my experience, it is always a good idea to work to make yourself as valuable as possible.\nSo what to do if you’re one of the countless thousands that have been trained as a feature team product manager or a product owner, yet you wish to show your company that you are capable of being much more than a coordinator or a backlog administrator?  Or, maybe you wish to prepare yourself to join a company working in the product model.\nThis starts with an honest assessment of where your skills are.  You can do this as a self-assessment, but blind spots are very real, so if you can find someone that knows what good looks like, and is willing to assess you, that would be ideal.  Then you can get to work building your skills.\nYou likely won’t need to spend time building your design skills or your engineering skills.  That’s why you have a professional designer and professional engineers on your team.  Your contribution is very different.  But you likely will need to build your business skills, data skills, and your customer knowledge.\nMaybe you can also now understand why we remain philosophically against the many so-called certifications in the product management and product owner industry.  Despite the obvious marketing benefits of convincing people there is some sort of value in these certifications, they are essentially indicating you’ve had some level of training in a particular process or methodology.  They say nothing about the product skills and experience that actually matters to your product team.\nIt takes real effort, but people with true product skills have historically been very valuable, and I’m betting that will continue to be the case through the changes ahead.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-management-theater/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925896335,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Manager Job Description - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tOne of the most common requests I’ve received over the years is to share a good job description for a product manager of an empowered product team.  \nAnd for about as long as I can remember, I’ve forwarded on the job description that Google uses.  It’s still a decent description, but I also think it’s true that many potential candidates don’t catch all the cues and important differences between the PM role as it’s defined on a typical feature team, and a PM on an empowered product team.\nSo finally I decided to just write out a very explicit job description, calling out the important differences.  If your company is trying to transition to truly empowered product teams, then this is one of the most important things to get right.\nNote: You may notice that there’s no requirement here for specific domain knowledge, and that’s intentional, and not just an effort to keep this job description generic.  You can read why here. \nProduct Manager Job Description\nAbout The Job:\nWe empower our product teams to solve hard problems – customer problems and business problems – in ways that our customers love, yet work for our business.   Our product teams are cross-functional and durable, generally comprised of a product manager, a product designer, and several engineers.\nWe staff our product teams with the skills necessary to come up with effective solutions that are valuable (our customers choose to buy or use), viable (the solution works within the many constraints of the business), usable (the user can figure out how to use) and feasible (our engineers have the skills and technology to implement).\nWhile the product designer is accountable for ensuring the solution is usable, and the engineers are accountable for ensuring the solution is feasible, the product manager is accountable for ensuring the solution is both valuable and viable. \nThis means that the product manager must contribute to her product team a solid knowledge of the various constraints of the business – constraints from marketing, sales, service, finance, legal, and privacy are typical examples.  The product manager must also contribute to the product team a deep knowledge of our users and customers, and the data about how our customers engage with our products.  Finally, the product manager is expected to track industry trends and the competitive landscape as they pertain to her product.\nWhile each member of the product team may be accountable for a specific risk, we look for product managers that understand that consistent innovation is the result of each member of the product team contributing their passion and their ideas.  The product manager must collaborate closely with her product designer and engineers to discover effective solutions, and then work together to deliver those solutions to market.\nWhile we empower our product teams to figure out the best solutions to the problems that need to be solved, we also hold those teams accountable to the results.  Shipping is necessary, but not sufficient.  We look for product managers that are not afraid of signing up for results, even when this means they have to work through others to achieve the necessary results.\nThis job, as with the other roles on the product team, is an individual contributor role.  You will need to be able to influence your teammates, as well as colleagues, stakeholders, and key executives, through your use of data and logic.\nNecessary Qualifications:\nBachelor’s degree or equivalent practical experience.\nDemonstrated understanding of the techniques and methods of modern product discovery and product delivery.\n2 years working on technology-powered products as either a product manager, product designer, engineer, data analyst, data scientist, or user researcher. \nDemonstrated ability to learn multiple functional areas of business – engineering, design, finance, sales, or marketing.\nDemonstrated ability to figure out solutions to hard problems with many constraints, using sound judgement to assess risks, and to lay out your argument in a well-structured, data-informed, written narrative.\nProven ability to engage with engineers, designers, and company leaders in a constructive and collaborative relationship.\nDiverse Perspectives:\nWe know that innovation thrives on product teams where diverse points of view come together to solve hard problems in ways that are just now possible.  As such, we explicitly seek people that bring diverse life experiences, diverse educational backgrounds, diverse cultures, and diverse work experiences.  Please be prepared to share with us how your perspective will bring something unique and valuable to our product teams.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-manager-job-description/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925789405,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Managers vs Product Leaders - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFor those that have been following along, I recently wrote about alternatives to product managers, and alternatives to product leaders as the context to understand the debates in the industry around the different styles of leadership (essentially empowerment vs command and control).\nOne of the consequences of these articles, and the resulting discussions, is that I’ve had several really thoughtful conversations with people ranging from individual contributor product managers up to CEO’s.  As so often happens, the discussions after an article help me to more clearly understand how people think about these topics, which then helps me to find better ways of explaining.\nThe subject of this article is to address an issue that I have heard occasionally in the past, but I didn’t realize just how common the confusion was until I had a chance to dig in with different people on the product leadership topic, especially people in Europe.\nThe issue is that due to the lack of any sort of standardization or consistency in the product community (nobody’s fault), for many people out there, the term “product leader” is used synonymously with “product manager” (and sometimes even with “product owner”).\nI certainly did not coin any of these terms, but I was always taught that a “product manager” was an individual contributor, and a “product leader” was a people manager (I am simplifying a bit here, but I’ll elaborate on each below).\nI think I’ve been pretty consistent over the years in emphasizing that “the product manager is not the boss of anybody” and that “the single most important responsibility of a product leader is developing the skills of her people.”\nHowever, it’s also true that I’m just one voice of many out there, and others have long used the phrase “product leader” in the more general sense to represent either the product manager or product owner.  And this is not unreasonable as “leadership” is certainly one of the qualities of a strong product manager (just as it is with a strong engineering tech lead).\nBut hopefully everyone would agree that there are very significant differences between the individual contributor product person on a product team, and the manager of product people, responsible for coaching and developing the people, and for the strategic context.\nI have never loved the title “product manager,” but I also believe that we all have to pick our battles, and this is a case of “standard is better than better.”  So I have never tried to introduce a different term, and have no desire to do so now.  The term “product leader” is also not very precise, but in all these years I’ve never heard a better term, and again I have no desire to try to introduce one.\nThe specific titles for the product individual contributor that are most common: associate product manager, product manager, senior product manager, and principal product manager.\nThe specific titles for the product people manager that are most common: manager of product management, director of product management, vice president of product, and chief product officer.\nAnd there’s one hybrid title group product manager (which is a player-coach role, and I’m a big fan of this one for people considering moving from product management into product leadership).\nSo my hope and humble request of the product community is that in order to help people understand what we all mean when we discuss difficult product concepts, we reserve the term product manager for the individual contributor, and the term product leader for the managers of product people.\nI believe that the majority of the product community already uses these definitions, but there is a significant minority, especially in Europe, that don’t, and this leads to substantial and unnecessary confusion.\nI know that we’ll never get everyone in a community of our size to agree on nomenclature, but I’m hoping the value of the clarity is enough to sway most.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-managers-vs-product-leaders/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925967305,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Market Fit vs. Product Vision - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tEarlier I expanded on the notion of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and I promised a series of articles that explores aspects of MVP Tests that often cause product teams confusion.  In this article, I’d like to discuss the relationship between the MVP Tests, Product Market Fit, and the Product Vision.\nAs a reminder, the Product Vision describes the types of services you intend to provide, and the types of customers you intend to serve, typically over a 2-5 year timeframe.\nWhen I meet a startup, or begin working with a team that has an ambitious new project, we typically start with the Product Vision.  I’m a big believer that if you don’t know where you’re heading, then you don’t have much chance of getting there.\nHowever, it’s important to acknowledge that every Product Vision is predicated on a set of beliefs about what customers will find valuable, and that we hope can one day sustain a business or business unit.  It’s important to get these beliefs out on the table and set about validating them.\nOne of the most common mistakes I find is that teams embark on product discovery and Product Market Fit but without a clear focus on the customers they are trying to serve.\nSo we typically start by identifying a core set of Earlyvangelist prospective customers.  Remember, our intention with Product Market Fit is not to try to please everyone, but rather to find a set of potential customers that believe in the vision, and are willing to work together with you to discover a solution (also remember we don’t expect them to give us the solution – we just need to be able to test out whether our solutions work for them).\nOur hope and intention is to try to come up with a product that can make our product vision a reality.\nThat said, it’s possible that we’ll discover along the way that our hypotheses about value just aren’t reflected in our customers, or we might discover we need to pivot to either different customers, or different solutions, or different problems to solve.\nBut mainly we’re hoping to iterate our way to a solution that these Earlyvangelist customers find enough value in that they’re willing to buy, they can figure out how to use, and you can deliver with the time, talent, technology and money you have available.\nI don’t mean to gloss over the product discovery techniques of this rapid iteration using various MVP Tests – I’ve written about this many times, and more will come in the MVP and Product Market Fit context – but if we view Product Market Fit as the smallest possible product we could discover that’s sufficient to sell to our Earlyvangelist customers, then there’s still going to be a long way from this Product Market Fit to the product described in the Product Vision.\nJust because our Earlyvangelist customers will buy something doesn’t mean that everyone in the target market will buy.  If you remember the technology adoption curve, the Earlyvangelists are just the small but highly motivated group that’s really feeling the pain, and desperately need a solution.  To move from Earlyvangelists to more mainstream customers (early majority), we’ll need to continue to develop the product (typically by expanding the scope of customers we’re trying to serve, and doing product discovery to identify solutions to their needs).\nThis is why it often takes weeks or months to discover Product Market Fit to serve the Earlyvangelists, but then it can take years to expand the offering to the point that it meets the much broader market needs, and fulfills the product vision.\nSo, while the Product Vision inspires Product Market FIt, the Product Market Fit precedes the Product Vision and is usually the first real test of the Product Vision.\nProbably one of the most visible examples of the relationship between the Product Market Fit and the Product Vision could be seen with the original iPhone.  While there were many prototypes (MVP Tests), the original iPhone device (what Apple believed proved Product Market FIt) had many limitations (even missing copy-paste) but for the Earlyvangelist customers, they could see the vision, they found real value, and they embraced the device.  But of course that was just the beginning of the product line and not the end.  Each release since then has expanded the target market to meet the needs of a broader range of customers, and come another step closer to realizing the product vision.\nHopefully this all helps to put MVP Test, Product Market Fit, and Product Vision into perspective.  There is lots more to talk about but I’m hoping this can serve as a foundation.  Please continue to keep your questions coming.\nNOTE: Updated in January of 2014 to reflect consistent nomenclature (MVP Tests vs. Product Market Fit vs. Product Vision).\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-market-fit-vs-product-vision/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925967211,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Marketing Contribution - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tJane is supporting the launch of Product X, a new release her company is really excited about. She is on the marketing team. Armed with her launch checklist, she schedules a meeting with John, the product manager.  At the meeting, John answers all of her questions, draws a market segmentation on the white board, and talks about the key features and why they are important.  Jane takes lots of notes and asks John to review what she sends him.\nThe first thing John gets is a press release. The features are mixed-up.  There is no positioning – just announcing it’s “now available!” – and the quote sounds like it came from a Web 2.0 robot. John inserts corrections. There are so many it’s like a rewrite.\nNext, John gets the copy from the website. His corrections from the press release aren’t in it. The feature descriptions are wrong in an entirely new way because “the copywriter” took a pass.  John is starting to worry that Jane and the rest of the marketing team don’t get his product.\nJohn asks the head of marketing, Bob, “Are we all on the same page about the product launch?” Bob assures John, “We’re in great shape.” Bob says this because when he reviews the launch checklist, everything is on schedule. John assumes Bob meant the marketing of his product is part of some grand strategy connecting it with what the market needs to hear.\nAssured, John accepts Jane’s next meeting request to “review product positioning.” “At last,” he thinks, “I’ll see it all come together.” Jane shows up to the meeting and asks, “Now tell me how do you want to position Product X and what features do you want us to talk about?”\nDoes this confusion or frustration feel familiar? You are not alone and probably suffering from the need for Product Marketing.\nThe Problem\nWhat makes Product Marketing distinct from corporate marketing is it’s specific focus on using products—most technology companies’ greatest asset—to drive market strategy and growth. When a company is a start-up with one product, “marketing” and “product marketing” are often one in the same.  The need for it as a distinct discipline becomes much clearer when a company branches into multiple product lines or is highly technical or complex.\nThe Job\nMy partner, Marty, wrote elegantly about the necessity to split product management and product marketing into two separate roles https://svpg.com/product-management-vs-product-marketing/, and this assumes that model.\nI have yet to find a company that practiced the two roles as systematically and well as Microsoft, where I began my career. They recognized that the two jobs generally required different skills and people to be done well.  Product management (which goes by the program manager title) defined the products to be built.  Product marketing (which goes by the confusing title product manager) made sure the world knew about the products and why they should care.\nIt’s the “why they should care” part that requires far more product and communication skill than most realize.  To hone a compelling strategy and messaging requires deep customer understanding, an analytical mind, broad understanding of the industry and business, and—most important—a really good understanding of the “why” of a product.\nIt’s insufficient to just know a feature set or the business concerns of a C-level executive. If you get the in-depth “why” for a customer as well as the “why” for a product, you can dynamically position your product based on the specific goal or activity at hand. It’s this skill—the strategic application of product to achieve marketing goals—and the ability to communicate about it in a clear way that’s done insufficiently in many companies and is the domain of the product marketer.\nProduct Marketing Responsibilities\nGood product marketers have command of:\nCompetitive analysis (what is the competition saying and how is it shaping perceptions in the marketplace?)\nMarket and customer research (what matters in and beyond our category, what’s the engagement model of the people influencing product conversion or the perception of our product?\nProduct positioning (what is it, why is it different, and why should the world care?)\nProduct communications/PR/social media (what can we say that will make others do the talking about us?)\nMarketing communications and campaigns – advertising, email, interactive, search-engine, events etc. (when to use each and to what end)\nSales support, salestools (this includes demos and the product knowledge required to build a compelling one)\nVertical/affiliate/evangelist programs\nMeasurement of marketing programs (ROI and mapping to business goals)\nIn consumer companies, product marketers focus on enabling activities driving acquisition, activation, retention, and referral.\nIn enterprise companies, product marketers focus on shaping the product’s perception in the business and competitive domain and enabling sales channels.\nProduct marketers’ work also bridges product and corporate marketing teams, ensuring new product enhancements shape company messaging and strategy.\nWhat to Do?\nIn all the companies I work with, when we look at product planning through a product marketing lens, the what and when of features inevitably changes.  Having product marketers participate in product planning discussions ensures every product effort has the maximum market leverage at it’s back.  Remember if the world doesn’t know about a product, believe it is important, or cares, it doesn’t matter how useful or useable a product is.\nEven in organizations with existing product marketers (typical of most enterprise companies), the edges of the relationship between product mangers and their product marketing counterparts varies—due to skill differences, product maturity phases or often simply the lack of shared understanding of expectations.  Don’t let old habits get in the way of improving roles. Make sure product managers and their product marketing counterparts talk often so both feel invested in and understand market strategy.\nAdapt until things work well, as each company and group has to find a groove that works for their teams. The ideal relationship is one in which the product manager feels like her product marketer is an essential part of the team. That’s also how a product marketer knows he is doing his job well.\nHowever you get there, make sure the world knows why your product matters and invest in great product marketing.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-marketing-contribution/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925944434,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Model Competencies - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nNOTE: The context of this article is that for the upcoming book TRANSFORMED, this overview is intended to introduce the new core competencies that the product operating model requires.  But unlike other descriptions of these roles I’ve published, these are intended to be understandable by anyone in your company, from CEO to a sales person.\nIn the prior models, feature teams exist to serve the needs of the business. \nBut in the product model, product teams exist to solve hard problems for your customers and for your business, in ways your customers love, yet work for your business.\nThis difference may sound minor, but the implications are quite significant in terms of how teams work.\nConsider for a moment how profound this is.  We are essentially pushing the decisions and responsibility for finding the best solution to the problem down to the product team, and then holding the team accountable for the results.\nThis is what drives the need for the new product core competencies.\nIn this series of articles, we’ll discuss each of these critical new core competencies, so that you know what to look for and what to expect, and are not fooled when someone adopts a new title, but doesn’t have the necessary skills or experience.\nIt’s important not to underestimate the effort to establish these new competencies.  Everything that follows is built upon these competencies.\nTo be very clear, if your transformation fails, it will very likely be because you did not establish these competencies.\nIt’s also important to acknowledge that these new competencies can feel threatening to people that have built their career around different competencies.\nSome will view the product model as a major career opportunity and a chance to stay relevant for years to come.  Others will dismiss the topic saying “they already do this,” and others will simply prefer to “wait it out” in the hopes of the leaders giving up after a few months.\nIt’s also important to emphasize that many of your existing people can be coached and developed into strong contributors with the necessary competencies.  But don’t expect that to be true of all of them.\nAnd everything depends on your people wanting to learn, and then having product leaders or product coaches that are capable of helping your people learn these new competencies.\nIn this series of articles we will be describing each of the new core competencies.  But we’re not going to try to describe them in enough detail that you can learn these competencies.\nThese are each specialized competencies that normally take years to learn.  In fact, we have published two other books that attempt to teach the skills and techniques needed for these competencies.\nRather, we want to describe the new competencies such that you understand the need for these competencies, and you know what you can and should expect from people with these job titles.\nOne of the challenges in transformation is that many people have adopted the new titles of the product model, yet without learning the new competencies.  This is a much more severe problem than you might imagine.  \nWe want to give you the tools to be able to effectively judge competence.\nProduct Managers, Product Designers and Engineers\nA typical cross-functional product team requires three specific and very distinct skill sets.\nUsually that means at least three people, but sometimes a single person is able to cover multiple skill sets, or in certain specific cases, the particular product may only require two of the skill sets. \nRecall that when solving problems for our customers or our business, we need to come up with solutions that our customers love, yet work for our business.\nIn order to discover an effective solution, the team is responsible for addressing four different types of risks:\nValue Risk: will the customer buy our solution, or choose to use it?\nViability Risk: will this solution work for our business?  Is it something we can effectively and legally get to market, sell, service, fund, and monetize?\nUsability Risk: can the user easily learn, use and perceive the value of the solution?\nFeasibility Risk: do we know how to build and scale this solution, with the staff, time, technology, and data we have?\nIn a cross-functional product team, these are the critical competencies and what each is responsible and accountable for:\nThe Product Manager is responsible for the value and viability risks, and overall accountable for the product’s outcomes.\nThe Product Designer is responsible for the usability risk, and overall accountable for the product’s experience – every interaction our users and customers have with our product.\nThe Tech Lead Engineer is responsible for the feasibility risk, and overall accountable for the product’s delivery.\nIt’s also true that each of these three competencies can contribute to all aspects of the solution, but it’s important to know who specifically is responsible for each risk.\nAs you’ll see in the upcoming articles, the skills required to develop each of these competencies are substantial.\nProduct Leaders\nThe product leaders are the managers of product management, product design, and product engineering.\nThese are the people who will need to recruit, onboard, coach and develop the actual product managers, product designers, and engineers.\nIn addition to building and coaching the product teams, these product leaders have critical responsibilities related to creating a compelling and inspiring product vision, an insight-driven product strategy, and a carefully crafted team topology.\nMore generally, these leaders are responsible for ensuring that the product organization is aligned with the broader company in pursuing the best opportunities, and addressing the most serious threats.\nThis is why the people you select as your product leaders will very likely prove critical to your transformation efforts.\nIf you don’t yet have product leaders with the necessary skills and experience, then our first choice is to recruit them and get them in place for the kick-off of our transformation work.\nThat said, in many companies, the product leaders have some but not all of the necessary experience, and we can temporarily supplement their knowledge with the help of external product leadership coaches.\nOther Impacted Roles\nFinally, it is important to point out that there are a few other roles that are significantly impacted by the move to the product model.  These include product ops (in particular user researchers and data analysts), product marketing, and project management (aka delivery management).   These and others will be discussed later.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-model-competencies/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925796560,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Model Concepts - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nI started writing about the importance of focusing on achieving outcomes over just shipping output back in 2007, when I first started writing about the importance of product discovery.\nLearning to consistently achieve outcomes is unquestionably tougher than delivering outputs, but this is, at its core, what the product model is all about, and what SVPG is all about sharing.\nThis involves introducing four new competencies, as well as developing the new muscles for five new product concepts.\nThe purpose of this article is to give you a big picture overview of the necessary product model concepts.\nAs with the new product model competencies, each of these product model concepts can take real time and effort to learn.  The books INSPIRED and EMPOWERED attempt to teach the concepts and techniques needed to achieve the necessary results.\nRather, we want to describe the new concepts such that you understand the purpose of these concepts, and you know what you can and should expect from your people.\nProduct Culture\nThe first product model concept refers to the necessary cultural change. \nIt’s not hard to declare that your company now cares about achieving business results.  Especially because it’s very likely this has always been the claim.  What is hard is embracing the many changes required to adopt a culture of outcomes.\nAnd the most visible and profound change is typically the move from funding, building and shipping features and projects on specific dates, to funding, building and shipping products to achieve the necessary outcomes.   \nToday, this is commonly referred to as moving from output to outcomes.  I also like to explain this as moving from time-to-market to time-to-money.\nConsider how much of your organization is designed around, and optimized for, the predictability of dates.  The way decisions are made; who makes those decisions; the role of program or project management; the way teams are staffed; and how long those teams stay together; the way those teams decide what to build, and how they build; the number and timing of iterations; the level of customer, data and business knowledge of the team, the level of customer involvement; the role of experimentation, and the level of accountability; just to name a few of the major areas.\nProduct Strategy\nIn feature team organizations focused on output, the product teams are there to deliver what the stakeholders prioritize as important.  And with so many stakeholders with so many requests, it’s not unusual for product teams to struggle with prioritization.\nBut in the product model, the product leaders have the responsibility to look holistically across the business, and identify the most critical problems to solve, and outcomes to achieve.\nIf success is a function of picking the right battles, product strategy is how we pick those battles.  \nIt requires new skills around identifying insights from the data, our customers, the enabling technology, and the industry.  In the product model, the product leaders are constantly monitoring the learnings and insights, and adjusting course no less than quarterly.\nProduct Teams\nAs the product leaders identify critical problems to solve and outcomes to achieve, they are assigned to product teams, where the real work of product happens.  The product teams need to discover and deliver a solution that achieves the necessary outcome.\nAn effective product team depends on the critical product model competencies of product management, product design, and engineering, that has been empowered to come up with effective solutions to the problems they’ve been asked to solve.\nThe product model is designed around these empowered product teams, as that is where the value is created.  The main role of product leadership is to staff and coach the members of these product teams, and to ensure they have the strategic context necessary to make good decisions.\nProduct teams are responsible for both discovering an effective solution to the problem they’ve been asked to solve, and then building, testing and deploying that solution to customers.  The former is product discovery, and the latter is product delivery.\nProduct Discovery\nThe purpose of product discovery is to quickly discover an effective solution to the problem the team has been asked to solve.  \nAn effective solution is one that is valuable (the customer will choose to use or buy), usable (the user can figure out how to use), feasible (we know how to build with the available technology, skills and time), and viable (the solution will work for our business – it is something we can market, sell, service, fund, and monetize).  \nProduct discovery is about rapidly experimenting, mostly using prototypes, to try to come up with a solution that solves for all of the constraints and achieves the necessary outcome.\nProduct Delivery\nOnce the product team has evidence that they have discovered an effective solution, they now need to build the actual product that implements this solution, testing to make sure the product works as advertised, and doesn’t bring along any unintended consequences (regressions), and then they need to deploy this product to their customers.\nBut the team isn’t quite done because they still need to ensure that the product is delivering the intended results.  This means that the product must be instrumented such that we know the product is operating properly, and we can see the customers are using the product as we intended, and achieving the desired benefits.  If not, the product team needs to analyze the data, and iterate on the solution, until the intended results are achieved. \nThese five product model concepts form the foundation of the product model.\nThere are of course several other supporting concepts.  For example, product culture also depends on leadership that understands the value of empowerment versus top-down command and control.  A good product strategy depends on a strong product vision, and an effective team topology.  Strong product discovery skills depend on understanding both problem discovery and solution discovery.  Strong product delivery depends on the necessary infrastructure.  \nTransforming to the product model involves introducing the new product model competencies, and developing the muscles necessary for the product model concepts.\nOnce you have established these product model competencies and concepts, you can then use these skills to change how you build, change how you solve problems, and change how you decide which problems to solve.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-model-concepts/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925944749,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Operating Model Archives - Page 2 of 2 -

We also facilitate the execution by coordinating and tracking activities across the organization from launch to sunsetting. We are responsible for putting standard operating procedures and governance in place around our unified lifecycle.  We are the first point of engagement for stakeholder requests, and we manage timelines and deliverables.” – VP Product Ops for large hardware appliance company\nIn many companies, when Agile came in, the command and control style PMO (Program Management Office) was displaced. However, they’ve been seeking a way back in for years.  One very clear manifestation of this is the rise of SAFe.  \nBut the more recent manifestation, as in the quote above, and the one I wrote about in the recent article Process People, is using Product Ops as a Trojan Horse to bring back in the people, practices and especially the command and control mindset of the old style PMO.\nAm I being paranoid here?  Maybe.  But the reason for this is no mystery.  Many old-school CEO’s and companies crave the perceived predictability and control of the old PMO model – that’s a big reason they are attracted to SAFe.  But more generally, I am constantly worried about becoming a Day 2 organization.\nThankfully not all PMO people have this problematic mindset.  I know many exceptionally strong and truly helpful program managers, and they are essential for many types of very complex products – especially devices.  The problematic behavior I’m  referring to is the top-down, command and control mindset.\nI hope I don’t have to reiterate all the reasons why I’m no fan of this model.  All I’m really pointing out here is that in some companies, they are literally defining Product Ops just as companies in the pre-Agile era used to define a PMO.\nThe Two-in-a-Box PM Model \n“While a Product Manager owns the development of the product (aka, the person who Builds The Thing) a Product Operations Manager handles the day to day tasks involved with development (aka, the person who Makes It Easier to Build The Thing).” – Product School\nI feel like I have been playing “whack-a-mole” on this problem for literally twenty years.  \nThis problem pops up under so many different names.  Having both a Product Manager and a Product Owner on a product team.  Or having a Product Manager and a Business Analyst.  Or having an Outbound and an Inbound Product Manager.  Or having a Product Manager and an Associate Product Manager.  Or, the newest incarnation, having a Product Manager and a Product Ops Manager on each product team.\nI realize that the root cause of this persistent issue is that so many product managers feel like they have too much work to do, and too many responsibilities.  \nKnowledgeable coaching is normally the key to overcoming this issue, but combined with the next issue – where their manager is not willing or able to provide the necessary coaching – and people understandably look to split up the job to be more manageable.\nBut what these people don’t realize are the long-term consequences impacting the product manager’s ability to provide the contribution their product team depends on them for.  I’ve written many times about the negative consequences of splitting this critical role.  \nBut I recognize that I need to write more about this, as so many people do not really grok the need for the ongoing and hands-on aggregation and assimilation of information and insights so essential to an effective product manager.\nNow it’s important to be clear here about what is important to be part of the PM responsibilities and what is not.\nFor example, in most medium size companies, and nearly every large product company, there are teams of people to help product managers and designers answer questions quantitatively (e.g. data analysts), and people to help product managers answer questions qualitatively (e.g. user researchers).  We’ll talk more about these important roles below.\nIt’s critical that the PM still owns these decisions, and is not delegating them, but these people provide critical and essential help.\nThe Delegated Product Leader Model \n“Our company relies on Product Ops to ensure our product managers learn the necessary skills, select and understand the appropriate tools, know when and how to run experiments, learn how to interpret and leverage data, and to connect the dots between the activities of the various product teams.” – Director of Product Operations at large e-commerce company\nManagers of product managers are there to enable their product managers to do good work.  \nYet isn’t that also the general purpose of Product Ops?  \nIn practice, while Product Ops can definitely help when done well (as will be argued below), one unfortunate consequence is when the product leaders think they can delegate the responsibility for coaching product managers and/or developing the product strategy to Product Ops.\nVery related to the Two-in-a-Box PM model (and in my view the major root cause of weak product managers) is the situation where the product leaders are not willing or able to do their job, especially when it comes to coaching and product strategy.\nIn companies where the product leaders are primarily people managers (in the HR sense) and they can’t or won’t provide the necessary coaching or the strategic context, that creates a significant vacuum in terms of product leadership.\nAnd in some companies, they hope that Product Ops can fill that vacuum.\nThe problem of weak product leadership is not a new one.  \nWhen the product leaders are not willing or able to coach and develop their people, the people look elsewhere for help.  Sometimes to internal or external training programs or certifications.  Sometimes to mentorship programs.  These can be helpful, but nothing even close to having a manager that is taking personal responsibility for developing your skills and career.\nSimilarly, you may also have seen companies in the past that would create a separate product strategy team, often staffed with former management consultants. The problem then, as with now, is that these people would not be close enough to the ongoing discovery work on the ground (in the product teams) to gain the necessary insights to power good product strategies, and in any case, the strategy people weren’t well-respected enough by the product teams to pay much attention to what they came up with anyway.\nAgain, we do count on the existence of data and customer insights teams to help those product leaders to do their jobs, so there’s no expectation that they are doing all that work themselves.  \nHowever, and this is absolutely critical: it is the ongoing aggregation and assimilation of those insights, combined with daily interactions with the product teams, that enables strong product leaders and strong product strategies.\nBut more generally, when the manager doesn’t take personal ownership and responsibility for the skills of her product managers, then this either gets dropped or gets delegated, and the result is too often weak product managers, and inevitably weak product teams.\nThe bottom line is that there really isn’t a good substitute for capable, engaged product leaders working one on one with their product managers not just to understand the theory, but to learn the actual practice and nuance of strong product.  If that’s the real problem, then that is what needs to be fixed.\nProduction Operations Rebranding Model \n“A PM’s job doesn’t end at launch… But at many companies, this is where the [product ops] job really starts… they provide value… by making sure that things keep running smoothly.” – Product School\nI know the phrase sounds very similar, but “production operations” has a very specific and important meaning in many companies.\nSome readers will immediately know what I’m referring to and others won’t, because of the nature of their products.  \nLet me give a clear example from a favorite product of mine: Guardian’s Eyewitness.  Even more impressive than the product was that it was done by a 200-year old company, in only 7 weeks. You can read the origin story here, but the product was a photo-journalism app for the then-new iPad, and the product told the news through photos, which required daily coordination between a photo editor, news journalist, and editorial.\nWhile the product team created tools to support this daily production process, there is always a certain amount of ongoing production operations (literally “ensuring the product is running properly in production”).\nIt’s not hard to imagine that if the business/product operations issues grow large enough, it can place a large demand on the time of the product manager.  Partly that’s good because then the PM is motivated to invest in further automation.  But in many cases, it can make sense to designate a dedicated production operations person.\nThe problem is that this job function has never had a great title, and so it wasn’t a surprise to me to find some companies that have appropriated the title “Product Ops” for this.  \nAnd to be clear, it is an important role for many products, and if rebranding the Production Operations role to Product Ops helps these companies attract and retain strong people for the role, then that is understandable to me.\nAbout the only downside I can see is that over time, it will likely create some confusion for future employers trying to figure out what relevant experience the candidate with this title on their resume or profile actually has.\nThe Product Marketing Manager Rebranding Model \n“At our company, Product Ops covers two main activities: synthesizing ongoing customer feedback from sales, services and support, and coordinating launch-related activities including beta and early release programs.  Product Marketing initially tried to do this work, but they have not had the bandwidth, and in many cases, the necessary skills.”  – VP Product Ops for Enterprise Software Company\nProduct Marketing has always been a tough job, but for many products today, especially in the B2B space, the job has grown in difficulty at least as much as the product manager job has.\nLaunch related activities can be extensive with customer discovery programs, beta programs, sales, services and marketing training; continuous product go-to-market testing; and then the customer feedback needs to be aggregated and analyzed by the various sales channels.\nConventional product marketing can find it difficult to keep up with this demand and to attract talent capable of the depth and breadth required, so in at least some companies, the role has been expanded and effectively rebranded to attract a hands-on, relatively technical, true partner for the product manager focused on the product marketing side of the equation.\nThe jury is still out for me on this.  I am sympathetic to the need for this one because I have also seen this issue many times.  Maybe this is a case where a rebranding is necessary to make the job more attractive to the right type of people.\nIn any case, this is critically important work, and by whatever title, it’s essential that it be done well.\nAs with production operations rebranding, there is a minor risk that future employers will struggle to understand relevant experience of candidates with experience in this model.  And of course, this approach may introduce tension with the product marketing team.\nThe Force Multiplier Model\nThus far I’ve described five very different definitions of Product Ops – three that I consider old problems re-emerging with fresh lipstick, and two that are existing roles that have been rebranded to help make them more attractive to the right talent.\nNow I’d like to describe the model of Product Ops that I personally hope companies will consider adopting. \nI should say here that the definition I’m encouraging here is heavily influenced by how Melissa Perri defines Product Ops in her book Escaping The Build Trap, at least to the best of my understanding.\nShe defines three pillars (I am paraphrasing here to use the terms that my readers have seen me use to describe these concepts):\nQuantitative Insights \nQualitative Insights \nTools and Best Practices Evangelism\n– Quantitative Insights Team\nFor more than 20 years good product companies have had data insights teams (by various names) available to help product teams make data-informed decisions.  \nThis is especially important with data because it’s essential that you have a single source of truth about data (you don’t want every product manager defining and interpreting KPI’s in their own way), and because there are often multiple tools required to access the various data sources.\nIt’s important to point out that this needs to be an enablement team.  In other words, the data insights team doesn’t do the analysis as a service.  Rather, they enable the product teams, including creating self-service tools, and generally raising the data IQ of the broader product organization.\nThe problem is that this team often struggles to find the right home in the organization.  I have seen this team located as part of finance, as part of engineering, as part of sales or business operations, as part of product, and sometimes just on its own as a bit of an orphan.\nThe reason I like promoting this team into Product Ops is to ensure all product teams always have direct access to these essential people.\n– Qualitative Insights Team\nSimilar to the quantitative insights team, strong product companies have had qualitative insights teams for several decades.  Sometimes the team is just a small number of user researchers, but even a very small user research team can have an outsized impact.\nAs with the data insights team, In the case of user research, this is not about doing the research for the product teams, but rather, coaching and enabling the product teams to do good research and learn first-hand, as well as providing the infrastructure for ongoing customer testing.  \nUsually the team is part of the UX / Product Design organization, but sometimes it can be found as part of marketing, and occasionally in fairly random locations.  I’ve mainly seen the team called user research, customer insights, or market insights.\nAs with the Quantitative Insights team, I like the idea of promoting this function to a pillar of Product Ops.  \nOne way or another, every product team needs to be able to answer questions both quantitatively and qualitatively, but keep in mind that these insights teams are there to help product teams and product leaders to make informed decisions, not to make those decisions for them.\n– Tools and Best Practices Evangelism\nThis is the pillar where, in my experience, things are most likely to go sideways if you are not very intentional about the specific people you place in this role.  Of course that’s true to a degree with most roles, but few roles have the ability to impact the organization’s product culture as much as this one – for better or for worse.\nAs I described in my last article, in many of my favorite companies, they would take one of the most respected, senior product managers, often a principal product manager, and ask that person to help with raising the skills of the company’s product managers.\nThis might include development of an onboarding program or other forms of training, coaching on advanced discovery techniques, tool selection, creating and sharing relevant examples, and otherwise diving into complex areas to help other product managers and product teams.\nI have always loved using principal product managers and principal designers for these roles because first, by definition, these people have very deep and relevant product experience; and second, this helps the group effectively become a force multiplier.\nPromoting this into Product Ops makes this responsibility more explicit, with potentially more time dedicated to this.\nEspecially at scale, it’s useful to have one or more exceptionally strong people to lead product manager and product designer onboarding and training, constantly working to raise the bar on the skill level of the organization and ensure consistently strong teams.  And overall to be a resource to the product teams for things like best practices and coaching on especially difficult problems in discovery.\nOne particular process worth calling out is the quarterly planning process, which in a large organization, there is a lot of tracking, alignment and coordination work to be done, and having an experienced person or small group to assist can be helpful to all involved.\nMuch of this is necessarily on the product leaders (they need to be responsible for the product strategy and team objectives).\nAgain, with the wrong people in this role it can spin out of control, and “process becomes the thing.”  We want the planning process driven by the product leaders, and not the other way around.\nAnother reason I like principal product managers and designers in this role is that they understand that standardizing best practices sounds good in theory, but if not based on judgment and experience, it can lead to imposing one way of doing things on different teams where that way often does not make much sense.\n– Organization\nI like to think of this Force Multiplier Model as having a Product Ops function at the same level as Product Management and Product Design.  Product Ops is there to serve as a force multiplier to product managers, product designers and for certain activities, the product marketing managers.You could argue that this is just moving some existing people around, but one thing we learn in product and product marketing is that smart bundling and packaging can often have a remarkable impact.\nTo me, this particular combination of quantitative and qualitative insight services, along with best practices evangelism, makes for a more significant organizational impact, and a more attractive role in the organization for the right people to staff these areas.\nIt’s worth emphasizing that each of those three components of Product Ops represent three very different skill sets, and they are also non-trivial skill sets.  The Force Multiplier Model depends on highly skilled people in these areas, otherwise they can have the opposite effect: reducing the effectiveness of the product teams that depend on them.\nIn too many companies I see, they are taking very junior people, sometimes people with no directly relevant experience, and putting them in this very high-impact position.  Please don’t do that.  It’s effectively the same problem as when companies send their product managers to training by people that have never done the actual job.\nSummary\nWhile I know many companies that have long had the three pillars of what I’m calling here the Force Multiplier Model of Product Ops, I don’t know many yet that have brought them together organizationally under the Product Ops umbrella, but I’m hoping to see more try, and if you do, I hope you’ll let me know how it goes.\nMore generally, these six models I’ve described are just the main ones I’ve personally seen (I have encountered a few others but they seem like true one-off outliers).  I fully expect that there are others out there that I have yet to encounter.  If your company has implemented a different definition of Product Ops from the ones I’ve described here, I hope you’ll share that definition with me, along with your experiences.\nIn any case, given the range of different approaches to Product Ops, I expect that we’ll continue to see ambiguity until this settles down, and a particular model becomes more prevalent.  I’m just hoping it’s a model that represents a true step forward.\nSpecial

Organizational Structure - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn earlier articles I have discussed the key roles in the product organization – product managers, product designers, engineers and QA, user researchers, data analysts, product marketing and delivery managers  – and I’ve also discussed the ratios between the roles, but many organizations also struggle with the organizational structure that contains these people.\nWhile I have seen – and continue to see – a few different permutations out there, I do think that a standard organizational structure for product organizations has emerged, and that there are good reasons for this structure.\nI will admit that I do not feel nearly as strongly about the organizational structure as I do about the roles and responsibilities. I believe that if you have the right role definitions, and reasonable and well-intentioned management, you can usually make most organizational structures work, and I have no real problem with designing an organization around the strengths of the individual leaders rather than following a template from successful product organizations.\nThat said, we all know that organizational structure really does impact behavior, so all things considered equal, I argue that evolving towards the structure I describe below will improve the effectiveness of your overall product organization, sometimes in very profound ways.\nPlease note that I am only talking here about the product organization and not the other major areas of your company including sales, customer service, finance, business development and true IT (as distinct from product development).\nI argue that every CEO/COO or division GM needs three clear and distinct voices on her staff: Marketing, Product Management and Design, and Engineering.\nAs such, the most important aspect to the organizational design is that these three be top level, and one should not be buried within another.\nSo, reporting to the CEO/COO of a small or medium sized company, or each business unit GM of a large company:\n– Marketing contains functions including corporate marketing, marketing communications, field marketing, and product marketing.\n– Product Management and Design contains product management, product design (interaction design/information architecture, visual design, prototyping, user research), and if applicable, subject matter experts.\n– Engineering contains architecture, engineering, QA, release management, devops, and delivery management.\nNotes:\n– Notice that IT (the technical team that supports employees) is intentionally distinct from the engineering organization. This is the topic of a future article, but for now let me say that the demands on these two groups are inherently different, and that it’s important to treat each appropriately. In terms of titles, normally the CIO runs the IT organization, and the CTO/VP Engineering runs the product development organization.\n– It is a problem if Product Design is buried either in marketing or engineering. It is critical that the product design team, especially the interaction designers, be very closely tied to the product managers. Keeping product managers as close as possible to the design team is the reason for the trend towards combining product management and design into one organization (although each should have its own leader).\n– Marketing typically also has some number of graphic designers that support marketing programs and advertising. A strong user experience requires constant attention not just to the interaction design, but also to the visual design of the application, and this group should be managed by someone who understands what it means to support a product team. If there is a single Creative Director who understands both visual design for product, and visual design for marketing, the company is in great shape because one visual design group can serve both needs, and the overall expression of the brand will be very consistent. But if the head of the visual design team is under marketing, and isn’t understanding the needs of the product, you will need to correct this situation as soon as possible.\n– Sometimes product marketing is part of the product management organization. This is not a big problem, and there are some advantages to that, but I prefer when it’s part of marketing as this helps to reinforce role definition and make sure there’s no confusion between product management and product marketing. To be clear though, even if product management and product marketing are part of the same organization, the roles are different.\n– Startups are a bit of a special case in that they are typically small enough that the organizational structure is minor compared to the personalities and individual skill sets involved. But remember that if things do go well, you’ll grow fast, and you’ll want to put an effective organization in place sooner rather than later.\nIf your organization is not structured in this fashion, then if things are working great I would not suggest changing a thing. But if your team is struggling, and if it feels more painful than it should to get good products out the door, then consider evolving your organization more towards the model described here and see if that doesn’t improve the situation.\nSpecial thanks to both Chuck Geiger and Kyrie Robinson for their contributions to this article.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-organizational-structure/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925790079,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Predictions 2024 - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRecently I was invited by Productboard to give a talk on the topic of what 2024 might have in store for the product community.  If you prefer to watch a video (60 min), you can find the recording here.  But in this article I thought I’d share my thoughts in narrative form.\nIn general I’m not much for predictions, mainly because I have a long record of thinking things will happen sooner than they actually do, a form of optimism bias.  At this point, whenever I consider the future, I push myself to frame things as what I hope will happen, versus what I worry will actually happen.\nI picked the ten most common topics that people ask me about:\n1. Product Managers\nAs most people that read this already know, I spend a great deal of time trying to advocate for strong, competent product managers, responsible for value and viability, working closely with product design and engineering on empowered product teams.  I fully realize that this type of product manager has long been the minority once you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble.  But I try everything I can think of to help more companies move to this model.\nSo obviously what I hope will happen is that more companies will choose to work like the best.  I have a new book coming out in March describing this way of working to try to help companies transform to the product operating model.\nBut what I worry will happen is something I’ve been warning about for several years, and we all saw an example recently at Airbnb.  This is when the leaders get frustrated with the weak results of product managers that are more accurately project managers, and they decide to go in a different direction, such as trying to play the necessary role themselves.\n2. Product Owners\nThis topic is just so frustrating at this point.  The rise of product owners has done more damage to the craft of product than anything else I can think of in the past 40 years.\nThe root of the issue is that we have literally thousands of well-intentioned but process-focused “agile coaches” that have never done product at a product company, thinking they can train product owners.  They adopt some buzzwords, teach people a specific delivery process like Scrum, give people a certificate, and send them out to serve as “the product owner of a product team.”  Funny how they don’t pretend they can train engineers how to code, or designers how to design, yet they are fine pretending they can train product owners how to ensure they are delivering value and viability.\nSo I am very much hoping that we can just acknowledge this was a very big mistake, and move past this sad chapter.\nUnfortunately, what’s driven this situation in the first place is process people taking over Agile, and that shows no sign of slowing down, so my worry is that this will get worse before it gets better.\n3. Product Teams\nI fully expect that there will always be feature teams and empowered product teams.  Any time you find a command and control leader, you’re very likely to find feature teams there to support them.  So this is very much about trying to convince more leaders of the value of empowerment.\nMy hope is that more leaders experience the power and potential of empowered teams focused on outcomes, and embrace them.\nBut my worry is that more leaders will get frustrated over ill-equipped product owners, and feature team product managers that are really project managers, and go in the opposite direction.\n4. Product Leaders\nThe key to strong product managers and strong product teams really is strong product leaders.  And that’s why they are the focus of most of my work.  My hope is that if we had more strong product leaders, then more CEO’s would embrace this model.\nMy worry is that more CEO’s will think they can just do this themselves. \n5. Product Ops\nProduct Ops is a tricky one that could go either way this year.  My hope is that people and companies will embrace this definition of Product Ops from Melissa Perri: “Product Ops is the art of removing obstacles from evidence-based decision making.”  I love this quote, and while this is not new (product teams have had user research and data analyst teams supporting qualitative and quantitative decision making for more than 20 years), putting them together under a common “product ops” leader can raise the visibility of this important capability.  If this is how people implement product ops, I think this will be a positive step forward.\nMy worry is that there are others that are interested in product ops for a very different purpose, often referred to as “process and governance.”  Be wary of this.\n6. Customers\nSpeaking of qualitative and quantitative decision making, due to the continued extraordinary growth of the global addressable market, the quantitative side has been getting unprecedented attention with tools and resources, and that is all good.  \nWhat’s not good is that too many product teams get so focused on the data, they stop spending time actually talking to their users and customers, which really is essential if we are to understand why the data is what it is, which is so often the key to achieving the outcomes we need.\nSo my hope is that more teams will rediscover the value of actually talking to users and customers, but my worry is that we’ll continue to see more teams become one dimensional, and actually make slower progress towards outcomes because they are essentially trying to fight with one hand tied behind their back.\n7. Process\nIf you’ve read this far you already know my views on going overboard with process.  My hope is that people will realize that it’s the principles that matter, not the process.  But my worry is that so many process people are in positions of influence that this will only continue to get worse.\n8. Product Coaches\nOne of the ongoing challenges for companies that want to learn to work like the best is that in many cases their leaders have never seen product done well.  How are they supposed to lead their companies to a new way of working that they don’t know themselves?\nOne approach is to bring in new product leaders that have been there and done that.  But the more scalable approach is often to use product coaches to coach both the product leaders and the product teams.\nSo my hope is that we will see many more strong product coaches helping product leaders to coach and develop their people, and to develop the necessary strategic context (especially product vision, team topology, product strategy, and team objectives). \nBut my worry is that just as happened with Agile coaches, we’ll have an influx of product coaches that do not have the necessary hands-on experience at a strong product company, and the results won’t be good, and we know where that leads.\n9. Product Model\nThe product operating model (or just “product model” for short), is the term we’ve adopted to describe the principles underlying how strong product companies work.\nMy hope is that our industry can come to some sort of understanding and consensus on what defines strong product companies, and that is about the principles, and not about process or frameworks or tools.\nBut my worry is that the process people will try to define the product model as a particular process.\n10. Generative AI\nThis topic is no surprise, but how this actually plays out is anyone’s guess.  There are several dimensions to this topic, and it’s important to look at each.\nBut when it comes to the impact on product managers, I have real hope that the combination of product manager’s informed product sense and judgment, with new and very powerful tools to challenge and augment our thinking, will result in making better product decisions faster.\nBut I also know that many people will go to great lengths to resist thinking, and so my worry is that this will open the door to blindly accepting the recommendations of tools, and the result will drive more teams to the mediocre middle.\nSo bottom line, when it comes to product, there’s a lot of uncertainty heading into 2024, but also a lot of potential good.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-predictions-2024/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925878467,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Sense Demystified - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nEven though I have been writing consistently about product now for more than two decades, including a few books, I have thus far managed to avoid using the term “product sense.” \nThat was not an accident.  I have always disliked the term, and I especially dislike the implications.\nBut for whatever reason, a lot more people are using the term now, and I’m hearing it come up too often as the excuse I was worried about.  Either, “Trust me because I have great product sense,” or “I could never be a successful product person because my manager says I don’t have good product sense.”\nTo be fair, several serious product thinkers have been trying to clarify that despite the term, “product sense” is not something you are born with, it is a skill that you develop.  \nBut from what I can tell, these people are getting drowned out by the countless people that take the term too literally.\nFor most people, the word “sense” implies that it is innate.  As in, some people have a strong sense of smell, and others have strong product sense.\nBut what’s really going on is something very different.\nI argue that strong product sense is better described as deep product knowledge, and is the result of truly immersing yourself into a specific product space.\nYou build strong product sense by spending serious quality time with customers, analyzing the competitive landscape, immersing yourself in the product data, and consuming everything you can about the industry, and the enabling technologies.\nYour mind assimilates the learnings from all of these sources, and eventually, if you’ve been putting in the effort and paying attention, you have a very solid foundation in your product space, and you are able to not only understand the behaviors you are seeing, but you can also predict what’s likely to happen going forward.\nNow you may think that someone with years of experience in the specific domain might have a real advantage in developing this product sense, but in most cases this turns out not to be true. A disproportionate amount of innovation comes from people that don’t bring the baggage of the domain – they bring fresh perspective and the willingness to question dogma.\nI have “gone deep” into several different product spaces over my career.  But the space I went deepest on, and a space I still love, is the software tools space.  I’ve built several software tool products, and also was CTO of a software tool startup, and during these years, I was truly immersed in the space.\nI personally visited with literally hundreds of product teams to understand the challenges they faced and the tools they used.  I spent countless hours pouring through data.  I personally tested out every software tool I could find.  I established relationships with many of the key thought leaders in the space.  I followed the software tool industry and trends.  I met regularly with the industry analysts.  I spoke at the industry conferences.\nI did all this first as an engineer, then as a product manager, and later as a product leader.  \nBut the result was that I was able to see 5-10 years down the road with considerable accuracy, not because of any innate sense, but because of all the time and effort I had put in.\nAnd everyone I know that has clearly demonstrated this strong product sense has likewise put in the effort – even if they don’t realize it was that effort that’s responsible for their strong product sense.\nBut the good news here is that you can absolutely develop your product sense.  While I avoid the product sense term, I do say very often to people I coach that “there is no substitute for doing the homework.”\nIf you’re a product leader or a company founder, this is simply non-negotiable.  \nIf you’re a product manager, this is often one of the most meaningful differences between an entry level product manager, and the more senior levels (e.g. senior product manager, group product manager, principal product manager).\nOne important caveat when it comes to product sense:\nSome people think that because they have gone deep in one space, and had some level of success there, then their product sense will also be accurate for other spaces.  This happens when the person doesn’t realize the true source of product sense, and instead they think they have some sort of mental gift, but this is just arrogance, not product sense.\nAnd hopefully nobody thinks good product sense is a substitute for testing your product ideas. Product sense can definitely accelerate product discovery, but it’s more like having a compass as you navigate the product risks.\nWhile I might wish people would just stop using the term “product sense,” and instead talk about gaining deep product knowledge, I’ve been around long enough to know that’s unlikely to happen.\nBut hopefully more people will realize product sense is absolutely something they can and should develop, and ultimately we’ll see more product teams building products based on this deeper understanding.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-sense-demystified/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925932263,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Strategy - Actions - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tContinuing with the series on product strategy, in this article we need to leverage our insights into action.\nAt this point we have focused on a very small number of critical problems, and we have done the hard work to identify the key insights that power our product strategy.  Now we need to turn these insights into action, but there are two ways to do this.\nThis is the point where there’s a fork in the road, and it’s where we can tell if a company is serious about empowered product teams, or is still addicted to feature teams.\nI need to admit here that even if the company chooses to stay with roadmaps and feature teams, they are still far better off if they have a strong product strategy.  Certainly much better than the majority of organizations with feature teams that have no product strategy.\nThe difference really boils down to whether you give your product teams features to build, or problems to solve.\nMost of the time the difference is obvious (e.g. “add videos to our online help offering”, vs “improve the new user onboarding success rate”), but sometimes the difference is more nuanced (e.g. “we need an app” vs. “our users need to be able to access our services from anywhere”).\nIn the first example, adding videos is just one of probably hundreds of possible improvements to new user onboarding.  \nIn the second example, adding an app is very likely to be the primary way of providing access from anywhere, so the difference is subtle and either framing probably won’t make much of a difference.\nIf the leaders believe they know the necessary features and projects to execute on the product strategy, then they’ll likely put that info on a product roadmap and assign the work to the relevant teams.\nHowever, if the leaders want the product teams to feel ownership of the problem, and take responsibility for discovering and delivering a solution that provides the necessary results, then they’ll likely want to give the relevant teams as many degrees of freedom in coming up with an effective solution as possible.\nIt’s worth pointing out that the first approach is what we mean by a team of mercenaries, and the second is what we mean by a team of missionaries.\nOf course, it’s no secret that I am all about the empowered team model, as I deeply believe that it generates consistently better results, especially in terms of innovation and delivering the necessary outcomes.\nIf you’re still determined to provide your teams with roadmaps of features and projects, then this is where you’ll want to stop reading, as the remainder of this article is all about initiating action through the empowered product team model.\nIn the empowered team model, our intention is to provide the teams the set of specific problems they each need to solve, and then give them the space to determine the best way to solve those problems.\nThere are various techniques and systems for managing these problems to solve, but the most popular is the OKR system, which stands for Objectives and Key Results.  The Objectives are the customer or business problem we need solved, and the key results are how we measure the progress.\nWe have already discussed Company Objectives as a key part of the strategic context.  But to initiate action, we need to provide the product teams with their specific objectives, which are known as Team Objectives.\nIn an upcoming series on Team Objectives, we’ll talk in some depth about how to effectively use the OKR technique in the empowered team model.\nBut before we talk about the OKR technique, it’s important to point out that you really don’t need that or any other technique for this.\nAll that’s really required is for a knowledgeable leader to sit down with the relevant product teams, explain the strategic context including the product strategy, and then tell each team which problems you need them to work on, and what business results they should measure.\nIf the team has the right knowledge and skills, they’ll get to work.\nThe OKR system is a technique for formalizing these discussions, but it’s only a useful technique if you have staffed for empowered product teams, and the leaders have done their job to create an effective product strategy, and are ready and willing to entrust their product teams to solve the problems we need them to solve.\nIn any case, just because you are empowering your teams, this is not to imply that we can just leave the teams alone and hope for the best.  There is still considerable active management required to succeed on the product strategy, and that’s what we’ll discuss next.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-actions/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925931773,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Strategy - Focus - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tTo continue with our series on product strategy, in this article I’d like to focus on, well, focus.  The importance of truly “picking your battles” as an organization.\nAnd I don’t just mean deciding what to work on and not work on, but picking the few things that can truly make an impact.\nThis is another one of those topics, like whether a company cares about their customers; in pretty much every company I meet, the leaders already believe they are reasonably good at focus. \nBut often the company’s leaders need a reality check on this topic.  \nThe sheer number of things they believe are critically important, and that need to happen this quarter, or this year, are often an order of magnitude too many – I mean that literally.  Instead of 2-3 truly important things, they have at least 20-30.\nNow, in fairness, I understand why the key leaders believe they are reasonably good at focus.  \nThey have already had countless meetings where they agreed to so many things they really want to do, yet won’t be able to do this year.  So, from their perspective, they think they already know what it means to say no and sacrifice.\nIn large part this is a reflection of the leaders feeling the need to place a lot of bets, versus the best or most impactful bets; the fear of missing out; the need to respond to every competitor; to respond to every lost deal; to every customer request; these are all understandable reactions. \nBut in this case, they need an intervention, and a reset on what focus really means in a product organization.  In my experience, many organizations need this intervention.\nLet’s talk about what an organization that doesn’t know how to focus on what’s truly important looks like.\nAbout five years ago, one of the execs of Pandora shared the “Pandora Prioritization Process” which was published in the otherwise excellent, First Round Review.   The exec shared the company’s process for deciding what to work on and build.\nI had not worked with them, but when I read this, I immediately recognized the complete and utter absence of product strategy and especially focus.  Not bad product strategy; literally no product strategy.\nCombined with their dependence on feature teams, and their lack of any sign of true product management, it was clear this would lead to many features built, but little in the way of results or innovation, and the company’s inevitable decline.\nAnd over the next several years, that’s just what we saw.  A stock that IPO’d in 2011 at $16 a share kept steadily dwindling until at about $8/share they were finally “put out of their misery.”\nFor years I’ve been sharing this article as a clear case study of how not to do product.\nSo many companies have some similar sort of stakeholder-driven roadmap process, where they basically are trying to find a way to “fairly” divide up the engineering capacity across the different business stakeholders.\nYet another clear example of feature teams striving to serve the business, versus product teams striving to serve the customers in ways that work for the business.\nWhile common, this is an especially obvious example of the lack of product strategy, a lack of true focus, and more generally, a lack of product leadership.\nTo be fair, this way of working is rarely desired by the head of product; rather, it is usually the CEO and stakeholders that want to work this way, and the head of product is forced to serve as the facilitator.  \nWhatever the reason, this is an example of a company that is prioritizing, but not focusing.\nIt is easy to generate work with this approach, but not results:\n“Generating activity is not a problem; in fact it is easy. The fact that it is easy makes the real problem harder to solve. The problem is getting the right things done – the things that matter, the things that will have an impact, the things a company is trying to achieve to ensure success.” – Stephen Bungay\nThis is one of the most important lessons in leadership, and successful leaders have learned this one way or another.  \nEven though I learned this early in my career, this lesson was etched in my mind, and I’ve found that this principle applies in so many aspects of a technology business.\nWhen I was a new software engineer, working in HP’s applied research lab, I was fresh out of college which means that I knew something about the theory, but very little of the practice.\nThe way we worked at the time was using a practice referred to today as pair programming, where I was paired with a much more experienced engineer, and we wrote software “together.”  I use the quotes because the truth is that he did most of the writing, and I mostly watched and asked questions.\nWe were working on fairly low-level systems software, which at the time, and still is the case today with certain types of products, performance is key.  Systems and applications were often so slow as to be unusable. So “performance optimization” was one of our ongoing responsibilities.\nThe good news was that pretty much any area of code that we would examine, it was not hard to think of ways to refactor to improve the performance.  I kept pointing out areas that we could improve, but he consistently kept saying “we could, but no.”\nFinally, he said, “OK, time to work on performance,” and he proceeded to bring up our performance analysis tool, which let us measure the performance of our software, and we could very clearly see where the time was actually being spent.\nHe pointed out that while pretty much the entire code base could be improved, the vast majority of this effort would not matter in the least.  In fact, it would not even be enough to be perceived by the user. \nHowever, there were a few spots where almost all the time was going, and if we could improve those few areas, we could make a real impact, so that’s where we needed to focus.\nHe pointed out that in most organizations, they tell everyone that “performance is important” and so every team works a little on performance, but the vast majority of that work makes absolutely no difference, and in the few places where it could make a difference, it gets too little concentrated attention.\nThis was a very tangible example of the power of focus, but more generally, this is the situation I see in so many companies when it comes to focus and product strategy.\nBy not “picking your battles” and focusing on the few truly critical problems, most of the work going on does not make an impact, and for the truly critical priorities, there is not enough attention to actually move the needle.\nThere is also a very practical reason to focus on just a few truly critical problems.\nMost tech product people know about the concept of Work In Progress (WIP) Limits .  It’s an especially common concept in product teams using a delivery process like Kanban.  \nIt essentially says that we’ll get more work done (throughput) if we limit the number of things our product team is working on at any one time.  For most teams, it’s a few items. If you don’t have these limits, then work piles up at bottlenecks, and we end up constantly switching context, and as a result, getting fewer things out the door.\nNot a difficult concept, and most product teams see this play out on a daily basis.\nHowever, while this concept is definitely useful at the level of a product team, it becomes absolutely critical at the level of the broader product organization.\nWhen an organization has 20, 30 or even 50 “high-priority objectives, initiatives or projects,” all going on at once, we have the same problem, only much worse.\nFirst of all, if you have even 20 high-priority initiatives, that is likely going to overwhelm your organization and each team is then struggling with delivering on those initiatives, versus trying to take care of their customers – or otherwise pursuing the purpose of their team.\nSecond, there is a real cost to an organization, and especially to the leadership, for each high-priority effort or initiative, involving management time, decisions, monitoring and tracking, staffing issues and more, and the same concept of WIP Limits applies here. \nThe bottom line is that organization will get more critical work accomplished if it focuses on just a few at a time.\nSo, we need to pick our battles based on what really matters, and we need to limit the number of major problems we’re trying to solve at once.\nEvery good product strategy begins with this focus:\n“Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.” –Richard Rumelt\nIf the leaders are not willing or able to make these choices, then the product strategy is doomed from the start.\nIn the next article we’ll talk about how we identify and leverage insights on these few critical problems we’ve decided to focus on.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-focus/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925931723,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Strategy - Insights - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tContinuing with the product strategy series, in this article I’d like to discuss my favorite, yet the most difficult, aspect of product strategy, which is to generate, identify and leverage the insights that will provide the foundation of the product strategy.\nYou’ve probably heard the stories about the insights about customer behavior that drove early Netflix to rapid growth and profitability; or the insights around new user onboarding that drove early Facebook to explosive growth; or the insights around customer trials that Slack and Salesforce.com leveraged to spread like wildfire across businesses. \nIn this article, we’ll explore where these critical insights come from, and how to make sure you’re finding them, as they can hide among the thousands of other data points you’re likely collecting.\nThere are a few things I need to make clear before we get into this:\nFirst, if you’re looking for some paint-by-number playbook or framework for coming up with these insights and a solid product strategy, I’ll save you some time and tell you right now you’re not going to find that here.  \nAs I’ve tried to emphasize throughout this series, product strategy requires real effort and thought:\n“Good strategy … does not pop out of some ‘strategic management’ tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or fill-in-the-blanks scheme. Instead, a talented leader identifies the one or two critical issues in the situation—the pivot points that can multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.” – Richard Rumelt\nSecond, in every single case I know of, including every instance where I was able to contribute to the product strategy myself, this never happens without real preparation. \nYou might have an epiphany in the shower, but that’s only after you’ve spent hours studying your data, your customers, the enabling technologies and your industry.  \nThe information that’s in the strategic context – the company objectives, the company scorecard/dashboard, and the product vision – is the foundation for any kind of significant insight.  So, studying this is all part of “doing your homework” as a product leader. \nThird, it’s important to realize that these insights can come from anyone or anywhere.  You might find inspiration in an industry analysis on Stratechery, a chat with a sales person, a new enabling technology, a seemingly random comment from a customer, or an academic paper.\nBut without that preparation you probably won’t recognize the insight even if it’s right in front of you.  My main point here is that you never know what might help you connect the dots, so always keep an eye out, and an open mind. \nAll that said, there are four consistently effective and valuable sources of insights, and strong product leaders spend much of their waking hours contemplating these:\nQuantitative Insights\nFor so much of what we do, the big insights that form the foundation of successful product strategies come from an analysis of the product data.  Especially related to your business model, your acquisition funnel, your customer retention factors, your sales execution data, and hundreds of other important indicators of the state of your company.\nYou might have a theory about which customers respond best to your product, so you run an analysis and realize that in certain situations, your product is a dramatically better fit.  You realize you can either find more customers like that, or work to replicate that dynamic with other types of customers.\nOften, you will get an idea about the data, and you’ll have to construct a test to obtain the specific data you need.  This is normal, and the sooner your organization gets good at running these sorts of live-data tests, the better your chance of lasting success.\nIt’s normal today for product teams to be running live-data tests on a near-constant basis.  You learn something on every test, but every once in a while, you learn something truly important, a potentially valuable insight. \nThe key is to know enough to spot this learning, and then leverage this learning into meaningful action.\nQualitative Insights\nUser research is all about insights, which is why I’m such a fan of having strong user researchers in the organization. Mostly the insights they generate are qualitative and therefore not “statistically significant,” but don’t let that fool you – qualitative insights are often profound, and can literally change the course of your company\nThe user research community generally breaks down insights into two types.  The first is evaluative which essentially means, what did we learn from testing out this new product idea?  Did it work or not, and if not, why not? The second type of insights are generative.  This means, did we uncover any new opportunities that we weren’t pursuing, but maybe we should be?\nThis is actually the source of a very common confusion in product teams.  For the most part, in product discovery, our learning is evaluative.  We already have a problem we’ve been asked to solve, so we’re not actively looking for other problems to solve – we’re focused on finding a solution that actually works.  \nWe of course have lots of product ideas, and we test those ideas out with prototypes on actual users, and we can quite quickly learn the major reasons this product idea may or may not work.\nBut anytime we interact with users and customers, we have a chance to learn more about them, and sometimes we discover even bigger opportunities than the ones we’re looking into at the moment.  Even if they love the new thing we’re testing out, we may realize there is an even bigger opportunity if we’re open to it. This is an example of a generative insight. \nOr, even if a product team is not actively trying to do discovery on a particular problem, as part of the team spending time with users and customers every week (you are doing that, right?), we uncover new and potentially important problems to solve, or needs not being met.\nToo many organizations are either not doing this ongoing learning about their customers, or even if they are, they are not set up to leverage the insights that are generated, so the learnings are all too often ignored.\nTechnology Insights\nThe enabling technologies are constantly changing, and occasionally a technology comes along that allows us to solve long-standing problems in new, just-now-possible ways.\nIf the technology is new, you very likely don’t have anyone on the teams that has been trained on this new technology, and this fact ends up scaring off many leaders, or they occasionally think they have to partner with a third-party that does have the necessary experience.  But if the technology is important to you, your company needs to learn that technology.  \nThe good news is that this is rarely that difficult.  Your best engineers are probably already considering this technology and would love to be able to explore further.  \nIn the best organizations, it is the engineers that often identify these enabling technologies and proactively bring the possibilities to the leaders, usually in the form of a prototype.\nIndustry Insights\nThere is always a great deal to learn from the industry at large.  I don’t just mean your competitive landscape, but major industry trends, insights in other industries that may pertain to your industry, and insights from similar markets in other regions of the world.\nI’ve written earlier about my favorite sources of industry insights, but there are always some number of analysts covering nearly every space, and you should be following those that you consider among the best.\nMore than a few CEO’s have decided the best way to obtain these industry insights is to outsource this to one of the management consultancies, such as McKinsey, Bain or BCG.  \nI admit to mixed feelings about this.  The people at these firms are often very strong, but they have two big factors working against them.  First, their focus and their experience is almost always on business strategy, and rarely product strategy (and they often won’t even know the difference).  Second, the typical duration of their engagement is rarely enough time for them to gain the level of depth in your business needed for true product strategy work.\nSo the result is that their insights are not usually considered relevant by the product leaders or product teams.  Partly they’re right, the insights are not relevant, but partly the issue is that it’s very easy to discount insights found by a third-party.\nWhat I have found is that if you are able to recruit one of these management consultants to come join your product organization, they can often be coached into exceptionally strong product managers and product leaders.\nShared Learnings\nIn a strong product organization, these four types of insights are always the subject of interest and discussion, both at the leadership level and at the product team level.\nBut half the battle, especially in larger organizations, is getting the relevant insights into the right minds at the right time.\nIt is often remarkable how much a product team learns, especially as they are working on product discovery on important problems.  Yet it is easy for that learning to stay just with that product team.\nThe insights that are generated need to be shared and communicated.  Unfortunately, the most common way that most teams try to share these learnings is by writing them down somewhere – an email, slack, or a report. Sadly, this is rarely effective. \nThe product leader or design leader is often the first person to “connect the dots” between learnings of different teams, and see real opportunities.\nThe key is to make sure these learnings, whether they are coming from the data, customer visits, enabling technology, industry analysis, or any other source, make it to the product leaders.  \nIn many ways, leaders are given the data they request, not the data they need, especially to make insightful strategic decisions.\nThis is an important benefit of the weekly 1:1’s.\nThis is also another example of how empowered product teams don’t need less management, they need better management.  These leaders need to take the learnings and pass them along to other teams that may benefit from this insight, and more generally help to build their understanding of the holistic business.\nOne practice that I have long advocated is that the head of product should be aggregating the key learnings and insights from all the different teams in her areas, and at the weekly or bi-weekly all-hands, she should be summarizing the most important of these learnings and sharing with the broader organization.\nThis sharing serves a few purposes:\nFirst, it helps the broader organization, including the other product teams but also stakeholders, get a better understanding of the learning and insights that happen every week in the product organization.\nSecond, it ensures that the leader is truly grokking all the key insights and not just passing along some status in an email.\nThird, it is very hard to anticipate exactly where key insights will have the most impact, so it’s very important to share the insights broadly, especially across the other product teams.\nOne way or another, as a product leader you will need to identify insights that you can leverage to generate the necessary impact. \nAt this point, we have focused on a small number of truly important problems for the business, and we have identified what we believe are the linchpins for moving the needle for those problems.  Now we’re ready to turn those insights into actions.\nNote: In the article on Focus, I highlighted the First Round Review article on the Pandora Prioritization Process, and pointed out how it was an example of a complete lack of product strategy.  Coincidentally, in this week’s First Round Review article, they discussed the product strategy of the Superhuman team, which I would argue is an excellent example of a product strategy based on focus and insights leading to effective action.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-insights/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925928664,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Strategy - Management - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tContinuing on our series on product strategy, at this point we have focused the organization on a small number of truly important problems, and we have identified the key insights that we will leverage, and have converted these insights into actions in the form of objectives for each product team.\nWhile this is all necessary preparation for the work that needs to be done, I can tell you from experience that if the leaders stop here, you will be disappointed at the end of the quarter.\nThis is because no product strategy survives its initial encounter with the real world.\nThere are any number of issues and obstacles that will emerge, and while each product team will deal with them, and make most of their decisions for themselves, there will be many cases where they will need you to remove obstacles and barriers, or otherwise provide assistance:\nThe product team realizes that they have a dependency on another team, and that team is consumed with its own objectives.\nDuring product discovery, the team realizes that they require the use of a technology that they do not have access to, or knowledge of, today, so they may need to quickly acquire and learn.\nA major customer issue arises and the organization is scrambling to determine the best way to take care of the customer yet still make progress on the team objectives.\nSeveral product teams realize they all depend on changes from the same platform team, and that platform team is struggling to determine the best way to handle and help their colleagues.\nA senior stakeholder raises a major concern impacting one of the key objectives and the product team needs a decision made quickly.\nHopefully you get the idea.  None of this is unusual, but unless the leaders are actively engaged in identifying, tracking and resolving these types of obstacles, little progress will result.\nThe main source of information for the product leader will be the weekly 1:1 with the product manager.  Of course, if something urgent comes up, you want to coach your product managers to reach out to you immediately and not wait until the next 1:1 to discuss.  \nDuring this session you’ll be hearing of issues or obstacles, and you’ll be coaching on the best way to handle, and in some cases you’ll need to help by talking to a key stakeholder, or finding another engineer, or talking to another team about their need to help on a problem, or a hundred similar things.\nPlease don’t confuse this with command and control management.  You are not taking over control and telling the teams what to do; you are responding to their requests for help.  It’s more accurately described as servant leadership.\nWith all the normal urgencies and interruptions of life in a company, it is all too easy to find yourself half-way through the quarter with very little progress on the team’s objectives.  This is why weekly coaching is so important. You as the manager are ensuring that the product manager is making progress, and also as important learnings or insights are discovered, or major issues are identified, they are shared with you so this knowledge can be aggregated and disseminated to the relevant teams.\nThe coaching and the management of the strategy are not really different responsibilities as they are two sides of the same discussions.\nOnce again, with empowered product teams, you don’t need less management, you need better management.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-management/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925931824,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Strategy - Overview - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tUltimately, empowered product teams are all about giving teams hard problems to solve, and then giving them the space to solve them. \nBut, how do we decide which problems they should solve? \nAnswering that question is what product strategy is all about.\nRemarkably, most product organizations I meet don’t even have a product strategy. \nThey have no shortage of features and projects being worked on, and everything they are building is being built for a reason, but as you’ll see, they have no product strategy.\nIf you’ve never seen this great South Park clip on the Underpants Business, I’d encourage you to pause for a minute and take a look (if you’re watching this at work, you may want to make sure the volume is not too loud).\nSeriously, this really is what I see in so many of the companies I visit.  They have product teams that are more accurately feature teams, and they’re slaving away, pounding out features all day, but rarely getting closer to their desired outcomes.\nThis results in two things: first, there is a depressing amount of wasted effort (primarily due to their dependence on product roadmaps); and second, they are not putting enough concentrated brain power behind the most important things in order to achieve the results their company needs.\nYou may wonder how it is that so many companies don’t have a good product strategy.  I know I do:\n“Not miscalculation, bad strategy is the active avoidance of the hard work of crafting a good strategy. One common reason for choosing avoidance is the pain or difficulty of choice. When leaders are unwilling or unable to make choices among competing values and parties, bad strategy is the consequence.” – Richard Rumelt in Good Strategy/Bad Strategy\nSo, what even is product strategy, and why is it so important?\n“Strategy” as a term is ambiguous as it exists at every level on just about everything – business strategy, funding strategy, growth strategy, sales strategy, discovery strategy, delivery strategy, go-to-market strategy…   \nWhatever the goal is, your strategy is how you’re planning to go about accomplishing that goal.  Strategy doesn’t cover the details; those are the tactics we’ll use to achieve the goal. Strategy is the overall approach, and the rationale for that approach.\nWhile there’s many forms of strategy, what I care about here is product strategy.  Which in short means: how do we make the product vision a reality, while meeting the needs of the company as we go?\nSo many of the companies I meet have a goal (like doubling revenue), and they have a product roadmap (the tactics), yet no product strategy to be found.\nIn terms of product teams, product strategy helps us decide what problems to solve; product discovery helps us figure out the tactics that can actually solve the problems; and product delivery builds that solution so we can bring it to market.\nSo why is product strategy so hard?\nBecause it requires four things that are not easy for most companies: \nThe first is to be willing to make tough choices on what’s really important; \nThe second involves generating, identifying and leveraging insights; \nThe third involves converting insights into action; \nAnd the fourth involves active management without resorting to micro-management.\nChoices means focus.  Deciding what few things you really need to do, and therefore all the things you won’t do.\nBut I can’t tell you how many companies I’ve gone into and they have on some wall or spreadsheet a list of literally 50 major objectives or initiatives they’re pursuing. \nAnd each product team complains to me that they really have no time to pursue their own team’s product work because they have obligations that cover more than 100% of their available time, not to mention all the “keeping the lights on” work, and dealing with tech-debt. \nMoreover, many of these 50 major objectives or initiatives are truly hard problems, and just getting a little time slice and no clear ownership from a dozen or so different product teams has virtually no chance of making any real impact.\nSo, focus comes from realizing that not everything we do is equally important or impactful, and we must choose which objectives truly are critical for the business.\nWhile product strategy starts with focus, it then depends on insights.\nAnd insights come from study and thought. \nThese insights come from analyzing the data and from learning from our customers.  The insights might pertain to the dynamics of our business, our capabilities, new enabling technologies, the competitive landscape, how the market is evolving, or our customers.\nOnce we have decided what’s critically important (focus) and studied the landscape to identify the levers and opportunities (the insights), then we need to convert those insights into action.\nIn a company that’s serious about empowered product teams, this means deciding which objectives should be pursued by which product teams, and providing those teams with the strategic context necessary for them to solve the problems we need them to solve.\nBut we’re not done there because product strategy is never static. \nAs product teams pursue their objectives, some make more progress than others, some need help or encounter major obstacles, some find they need to collaborate with other teams, some realize they’re missing key capabilities, or any of a hundred other possible situations.\nProperly managing this activity requires smart, engaged leaders practicing servant-leadership.\nI’ve been a student of product strategy for most of my career.  After decades of practice, I think I’m reasonably good at it. My favorite activity is still solving the hard problems (product discovery), but if I had to choose, I’d say product strategy is the more important skill, and certainly the more difficult.\nIn the coming articles, we’ll dive deeper into each of these elements of product strategy – focus, insights, actions and management – but the bottom line is that product strategy requires choice, thinking and effort. \n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-overview/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925871483,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Team FAQ - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tEvery so often one of my articles seems to strike a chord, and this latest one on the difference between Product Teams and Feature Teams certainly seemed to do that.  I am grateful for the very positive response.  This morning I woke up to well over a hundred people who took the time to e-mail me a personal note of thanks, and often with follow-up questions.\nAs is my practice (and one I advocate for Product Managers generally), I like to consider the questions, and try to come up with a useful reply, and then share it so that everyone with that question, including in the future, can hopefully benefit from the dialog.\n– You said that the designer is responsible for usability, and the engineers are responsible for feasibility, but is that all they are really there for?  \nThis is extremely important, and something I know I need to write more about.  I tried to capture some of this in the recent article on what is meant by true collaboration, but let me be very clear: design is about much more than just usability, and engineering is about much more than feasibility.\nI will return to this point in a minute, but first I want to address the point I was trying to make.\nIf something ships from one of the companies I advise, and it is virtually unusable because of poor design (which as we all know occasionally does happen), you can bet I go directly to the designer and ask how this happened?  It is absolutely on the designer to ensure this does not happen, so something went wrong.\nSimilarly, if the product ships and performance is terrible you can bet I go directly to the tech lead with the same question.\nAnd most frequently of all, if something ships and the analytics show that it’s either not being bought or not being used, or it turns out that it violates some business constraint like compliance or privacy, you can bet I go right to the product manager with that question.\nRealize that as an advisor I have no actual authority or control.  But most of the teams know that my only goal is to help them become a more effective team, and these are prime learning opportunities and I am not going to pass them up.\nSo it’s critical on an empowered product team that we have the skills we need, and that these people are accountable for their work.\nAll that said, and back to the heart of the question, the way we come up with good solutions is with an intense give and take.\nDesigners often have insights based on deep understanding of our users and their behaviors that lead us in a different direction in terms of the problem we’re solving, or our approach to the problem.  These insights will often have big impact on value, and indirect impacts on things like performance.\nSimilarly, strong engineers have deep insights into the enabling technology that often leads us to entirely different solutions to the problems we were assigned, often much better than anything the product manager, the designer or especially the customer could have imagined.\nIf I had to pick the one thing I love the most about the feeling of working in a truly empowered product team, it is the form of magic that happens when you have people that are a) motivated and b) skilled in their respective discipline – product, design and engineering – and they sit around a prototype or watch a user interact with our prototype, and the engineer points out new possibilities, and the designer points out different potential experiences, and the product manager weighs in with the sales or financial or privacy related implications, and after exploring a bunch of approaches, they find one that actually works – it’s valuable, it’s usable, it’s feasible and it’s viable.\nSo hopefully this makes clear that these are two different but related points.  Yes, the designer is responsible for ensuring a usable product; and yes, the engineer is responsible for ensuring a feasible product; but coming up with that product requires their full range of skills.\n– Can you summarize the differences between delivery, feature and product teams?\nDelivery teams are not cross-functional (basically just developers plus a backlog administrator product owner), they are not focused on outcome (they are all about output), and they are not empowered (they are there to code and ship).\nFeature teams usually are cross-functional (at least some form of designer and some form of product manager), but they are still all about output and not empowered.\nProduct teams are cross-functional, focused and measured by outcome, and empowered to come up with solutions that work.\n– Can we have an empowered product team without a competent product manager?\nIn the article Empowered Product Teams I tried to describe the context that needs to be in place for empowered teams to happen, but one of the most critical pieces is that empowered product teams depend on having a competent product manager.  Without this, the first issue is that the team is unlikely to be entrusted by management.  The second issue is that the team won’t have the full set of skills it needs to come up with solutions to the problems they’ve been asked to solve.  And I also believe that the lack of a competent product manager is the most common impediment to empowered product teams.  Please note that I hold the product leader responsible for ensuring that every product team has a competent product manager.\n– I’m still uncomfortable with the concept of the product manager as CEO of the product.\nIn the article I emphasize that the product manager is responsible for ensuring value and viability.  That’s where this analogy comes from, and for those that have been a startup founder or CEO, you know that’s the heart of the job.  And that’s why I continue to believe this is an important and relevant analogy.  If that responsibility really freaks you out, consider the possibility that you may be more comfortable as the product manager of a feature team.\n– Why would people be upset?\nI spend much of my time in one form or another coaching product managers and product leaders, and I continue to encounter product managers that are not doing the job they need to do.  I often ask them where they learned product, and they will often cite books, conferences, and training classes.\nI’ve been very public in calling out the problem we have when product managers think that a CSPO class will teach them the product job, but it’s much worse than that.\nThere are many places today that offer “product management training,” and some even promote their “certification programs” but when I meet people that have attended many of these programs, and then when in disbelief I look at the curriculum, it becomes clear to me that they were being taught how to be a product manager of a feature team.\nOver the past several years, as the importance of product has become more widely recognized, the education of product managers has turned into a relatively big business.  And I knew that my article would essentially be calling bullshit on many of these programs.\nI want to be clear, over the past few years there have been a few genuinely good books and conference talks that have come out, and I do what I can to promote these.  But they are in the minority.  I can’t even attend most product conferences because it physically pains me to hear what is often being advocated.\nThe other thing I was calling bullshit on, but admittedly this was a little less explicit in my note, was the idea that “we are all designers.”  (As a side note, I find it amusing that you don’t hear teams saying “we are all developers”).  On good product teams, we are not all designers.  We are fortunate when we have one professional product designer.  It is true that we all (stakeholders, product managers and engineers especially) bring constraints to the designer’s job, but good designers are all about solving for constraints.\n– Is there any way to have true empowered product teams with SAFe?\nI am certain the armies of consultants and trainers will argue yes just like they have with every other buzzword that sounds attractive, but I really don’t see how.  It is a factory software model, and at the team level there isn’t even a true product manager or designer.  It’s pure delivery teams.  I wrote much more details on this in Revenge of the PMO.\n– Why don’t you like to engage on Social Media/Twitter?\nThe truth is that there’s some things Twitter is really good for (such as notifying the people that might care that I have just written a new article).  And there’s other things that I argue Twitter is awful for (such as discussing said article).\nIt happens every time.  I publish an article, and people will often quote something they like, which is nice, but then others that haven’t read the article will respond to that quote, with none of the context, and things degenerate from there.\nAnd I think the medium brings out the worst in people.  The interaction model does not encourage the type of thought and dialog that is necessary to deal with hard problems (Twitter is actually what inspired the article on the need for product people to think deeply).\nMoreover, even when I give in and I do occasionally engage, the next day, week, month, year, the same questions keep coming back up.  Bottom line is that there’s just so much nonsense spouted on Twitter and I don’t see that changing.\nWhich is all to say, if you’d like an answer from me, please e-mail me directly.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-team-faq/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925834300,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product Validation - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThe past few newsletters have had references to what I call “Product Validation.” This refers to verifying that the product spec (PRD) is describing a product that you know

so far that I am amazed that I continue to encounter product teams that don’t do this.\nOne of the biggest and most common mistakes product teams make is to have far more confidence in their product specifications than they should, and they move forward and think they’ll adjust the product – if necessary – once they get beta feedback. But of course beta is far past the time for major changes, and it is little wonder so many initial product releases are so far from the mark.\nAs product manager, it is your responsibility to ensure that this doesn’t happen to your product. The key to doing this is to prove to yourself and to the rest of the product team that the spec you give them describes a winning product. You can do this, and it costs far less than you probably think.\nThere are actually three important types of validation that you need to perform before you hand over a final product specification to the product team:\nFeasibility Testing\nOne immediate question is whether or not the product is going to be buildable, with the technology available. Your engineers and architects should be very involved in investigating technologies and exploring possible approaches. Some paths will be dead-ends, but hopefully others will prove viable.\nWhat is most important is that if there are obstacles the engineering team considers insurmountable in this product’s timeframe, it is important to know this now rather than discovering this much later in the process after the time and money has been lost.\nSome products have more technical risks than others, but if yours has significant risks regarding feasibility, make sure you address them early.\nUsability Testing\nYour product designers (UI/interaction designers) will be working very closely with you to come up with ways of presenting the functionality in the product so that the different types of users can figure out how to actually use the product.\nUsability testing will often uncover missing product requirements, and also, if done well, identify product requirements that are not as necessary as originally thought. You should plan on multiple iterations before you come up with a successful user experience.\nThe purpose of the usability prototype is to have something to test on real people, and usability testing is the art and science of getting useful feedback on your product from your target customers. Certainly the product manager and designer will use the prototype and learn a great deal from it, but there is no substitute for putting the prototype in front of actual people from the target customer base.\nNote that for usability testing purposes, it is perfectly fine if complicated back-end processing is simulated – the key is to evaluate the user experience.\nDesirability Testing\nFinally, it is not enough to know that your product is feasible to build and will be usable, but what really matters is whether or not your product is something users will want to buy – i.e. how much do users and customers like and value what you’re doing?\nThis testing can typically be combined with the usability testing, and the prototypes used can generally be the same, but in usability testing you’re seeing if users can figure out how to do the necessary tasks, while in desirability testing you’re seeing if they actually care about those tasks and how well you solve them.\nFor a few small product efforts, simply working your ideas out on paper may be sufficient. But for most products, with complex user interactions or new uses of technology, these prototypes are absolutely critical in order to assess whether or not the product will meet its objectives.\nThe prototype may be a physical device, or it may be a quickly assembled version of a software product. The key is that it needs to be realistic enough that you can test the prototype on actual target customers and they can give you useful feedback.\nUntil recently there was debate over the relative merits of “high-fidelity” prototypes (what I’m describing), versus “low-fidelity” prototypes (essentially paper drawings). Today I consider this debate meaningless, because the cost of high-fidelity prototypes has dropped so low, and the quality of the feedback is so much higher.\nIn the past, there were two major obstacles to these types of prototyping. The lack of good prototyping tools meant that it could take a long time to actually construct the prototype. Another problem was in unenlightened management not understanding the difference between a prototype and the real product, and the teams would get pressured to use the prototype as the basis for the final product, with predictable results in the quality of the implementation.\nToday, there are outstanding prototyping tools that can let engineers or designers rapidly create very functional prototypes (often in hours or days) that can effectively emulate the future product, to the degree necessary, and form the basis of realistic user testing. Moreover, most managers today understand that building a simulation and building the actual product are very different – akin to building a scale model of a house, and building the actual home.\nThese are not the only ways to validate your product – especially for internet services there are other techniques that are also easy and effective – but I can’t emphasize enough how important and valuable it is to validate your ideas before you go and actually build the product. There are always surprises, and it is far better to discover them early rather than to wait until the product is in beta or released. Further, once the real engineering begins, a special type of inertia sets in, and it becomes very difficult to make significant changes and the costs of the changes rises dramatically.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-validation/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925877367,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Product vs. Policy - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMost people today know that when we refer to “product,” we mean that in a very holistic sense.  It’s not just the code.  It’s not just the user interface.  It’s not just the app.  It is meant to reflect the full customer experience.  Online and offline.  Customer facing and customer enabling.\nThat said, I don’t think I’ve written enough about the non-code aspects of product.  And especially over the past few years, it’s become increasingly clear that many otherwise strong product leaders do not fully understand the role of these other aspects.\nSo what I wanted to highlight in this article is the role of policy.  \nNow, to be very clear, I view policy as an integral aspect of product, so I’m not trying to contrast product and policy.  Rather, I want to call out and highlight the key role that policy plays in our products.\nWe have all been witnessing Elon Musk getting a crash course in the role of policy.  Unfortunately, we have all been witnessing not only his education, but his values.  \nAs painful as this has been to watch, it has served as a remarkably clear example of the impact of policy on the product, the impact of the company’s values on that policy, and the impact of the company’s leadership on the company’s values.\nBut this article is not about Twitter.  That’s just an egregious example of the role of policy in product. But it’s important to recognize that essentially every product has policy.\nFor the vast majority of products out there, policy plays a relatively minor role, and it’s simply referred to as business rules.\nThese rules are usually pretty pedestrian.  Things like tax rates – or even whether you collect taxes.  Merchandise return policies.  Do I need to provide a credit card in order to book a table for a party of 10 at a restaurant?  Can I then cancel that reservation without a penalty? Will we share the data we collect?\nBut in some products, the policy can be extremely consequential.  \nWhen handled appropriately by the product organization, the policy is an integral part of the offering, and in providing the desired value to customers:\nThis is why eBay has a carefully crafted reputation system at the foundation of its marketplace.\nOr even controversial capabilities such as Uber’s surge pricing can actually improve the health of a marketplace.\nIt is also why Apple has a very people and time-intensive process for reviewing apps that have been submitted to the app store.\nBut in too many companies, the product organization has not taken policy seriously enough, and the consequences can be seriously damaging, or even tragic:\nYou’ve all seen the role of policy plays in content moderation systems like Twitter.\nLest we forget what happens when API access policy is not taken seriously, as was the case with the Facebook API and Cambridge Analytica.\nOr why Hertz filed false police reports against thousands of their own customers.\nOr why Tesla’s autopilot has struggled to recognize motorcycles.\nOne of the challenges of policy is that it’s usually necessary at the product organization level, as the product team level is usually too granular.  It generally needs to be addressed at the same level as the product vision and product strategy.  That is, it applies to all the product teams in that business.\nAs head of product at early eBay, in addition to leaders of the major pillars of the marketplace (e.g. buyers, sellers, platform), I also had a very smart VP Policy reporting directly to me.  And I remember that the policy topics were not easy in any sense.\nBut hopefully more product leaders will learn the lessons from the many visible policy failures out there, and take the policy topic as seriously as necessary.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-vs-policy/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925884481,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Products and People - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n“In the end, there are two things that matter: products and people. What you build, and who you build it with.”  – Tony Fadell\nOne of the most common questions I’m asked is how to convince your CEO to take a hard look at how you create your products, and consider adopting the practices of the best product companies?\nOur writing focuses on product teams, product leaders and most recently, product marketing.  And we’ve shared that we’re working on another book aimed at sharing the keys to meaningful transformation.\nBut realize that our lens is product teams and product leaders.  The CEO brings a very different lens and a different perspective.\nFortunately, there are a set of excellent books aimed at CEO’s that describe the benefits of empowered organizations.  Last year I shared a list of my favorite such books.\nBut just recently a new book has come out, one that I didn’t even know was coming, written by an author that is very well known in our industry, but is also someone I have never personally met.\nThe book is called Build: An Unorthodox Guide To Making Things Worth Making by Tony Fadell, the product leader behind the iPod, the iPhone, and most recently, the Nest line of connected home devices, where he was co-founder and CEO.\nI was amazed that this person, that had largely grown up professionally in Silicon Valley for 30 years, usually within a few miles of where I was working, but focused on consumer electronics while I was focused on internet platforms and services, had somehow managed to make so many of the same mistakes, have so many similar experiences, and learn so many of the same lessons.\nYou can easily see the differences between building consumer electronics versus internet services, but what struck me even more were the similarities.  You can also see the differences between working at a startup versus working at a large company, another thing we both experienced, and which clearly left a strong impression on both of us.\nAbout half way through the book Tony shares that Bill Campbell was his coach as he was building his own company, so there’s that common thread yet again, and probably explains a great deal of the principles in both of our writing.\nBut I don’t want to just add this book to my list of recommendations, as I think this book is special, and stands above the rest.  \nSVPG is all about sharing the practices of the best companies versus the rest, and this new book does what I consider the best job yet of sharing the practices of the best, but this time from the CEO’s perspective.\nIf you’re thinking that this “unorthodox guide” will describe some new type of process or new organizational structure, you’ll soon learn it’s just the opposite: “His advice is unorthodox because it’s old school. Because Tony’s learned that human nature doesn’t change.”\nIt’s about the product, and the people that build it.  As always.\n–\nFor those that are interested, below are some more detailed thoughts:\nI loved Tony’s thoughts about changing the dynamic with direct sales organizations leading to sales-driven products.  I have not heard about this before, and I don’t know how many companies will follow his advice, but I’m absolutely hoping this gets traction.I listened to the audiobook version, and Tony did not record this himself, although I wish he did.  The narrator was not bad, but clearly had no idea what or who he was talking about when he read the manuscript.  I laughed out loud when the narrator read the chapter titled: “The Point of PMs” as “The Point of P-M-S” which of course brought out the middle schooler in me.  Harmless, but I was a little surprised that someone that is so well known for meticulous attention to every product detail would not have personally QA’d the narration, but he very likely made the mistake of trusting the publisher.Speaking of the chapter on product management, it’s clear that this is not the author’s area of expertise, especially since he had so many years at Apple which has an unusual way to cover the PM responsibilities, but still he did a remarkably good job capturing the importance of the role and the challenges.  The one difference between what he described and what we advocate is that he puts a bit more of the product marketing responsibility on the product manager’s shoulders, but he does make a good argument for doing so.The chapter on Assholes was excellent, and added a dimension to the discussion that goes beyond what we covered in EMPOWERED and also goes beyond the No Assholes Rule book.I loved the emphasis on storytelling as the heart of the product vision and the focus on addressing both emotional and rational needs.I also loved how coaching and mentoring was emphasized throughout.And of course he had countless examples of prototyping as the basis for product discovery, including many very creative examples.Google’s senior leadership does not come out looking very good.  I know we all like to think that Google is better than that, but the book does a good job of showing why less comes out of that company than you would think given the size of their talent pool and the money they spend.More generally, I considered every single chapter valuable, and the book as a whole a very significant contribution to the tech community.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/products-and-people/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925909766,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Prototype of the Day - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn earlier articles I have written about several of the challenges that work from home has created for product teams, especially as it relates to product discovery.  I have also written about some of the opportunities that this same work from home has created.\nOne particular challenge that has been especially troublesome for many teams, is the temptation to revert back to simply passing artifacts back and forth between the product manager, the product designer, and the engineers.\nThe teams I talk to are well aware of the dangers of this, but they complain that the burden of trying to maintain a high degree of true collaboration, while dealing with the hassles of everyone being remote, have taken a real toll on many people and teams.\nIn this article I want to share a technique that has been helping with this problem.  To set your expectations, this technique does not eliminate the problem, and it does not replicate the intense collaboration we get with co-location, but it can help to return some of the collaborative energy to a team.\nIt is typical in product discovery that we have many prototypes, with many iterations of each prototype, that we use to explore alternative solutions and approaches to the problems we’ve been asked to solve.  And as you hopefully know, there are several important forms of prototypes we use.\nMost of these prototypes and prototype iterations are created by our product designer.  And most designers today use one or more of the modern prototyping platforms.\nRemember also that many of these prototype iterations don’t even make it past the product team.  The product manager, the product designer, or one of the engineers see something in the prototype that convinces them they should continue to iterate.\nAnd for the iterations that do get tested with users (for usability and value) and stakeholders (for viability), we need to discuss what we learned and how we’ll address the issues.\nThis is the power of quickly fleshing out an idea in a prototype so we can see how the idea works out in practice, much sooner than if we had put the work on the product backlog and had the engineers build out the idea, only to learn it was a bad idea.\nWhile this cadence of the designer iterating on the prototype and getting feedback from the rest of the product team happens easily, naturally and largely continuously with co-location, it takes some real effort to continue this practice when we’re all working from home.\nWith this simple technique, we schedule a daily time – even 15 minutes works – where we can all take a look at the latest prototype iteration and discuss.  Some teams like to hold this meeting at the end of the day so that if the group gets excited about something they don’t have to rush off.\nAt a minimum, this should include the product manager, product designer and the tech lead.  But I like to invite the rest of the product team as optional.\nCould each team member look at the prototype themselves asynchronously?  Sure, but we lose much of the back-and-forth collaboration we’re hoping for.\nThe primary reason for the time is to keep us moving forward on discovering a good solution.  Discovery depends on being able to quickly try out approaches and solutions, so the prototyping is the key here.  Just talking with your colleagues every day is not the same as trying out product ideas and assessing the results together.\nBut secondarily, this high-quality team time has a way of keeping us focused on the prize, and feeling good about how fast we’re learning.\nScheduling any ongoing synchronous meeting should not be taken lightly, but if your product team is struggling to maintain collaboration during product discovery, I hope you’ll consider giving this simple technique a try.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/prototype-of-the-day/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925949772,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Revenge of the PMO - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tUPDATE 2: Another name for this article could be “Product Teams vs Delivery Teams”.  That’s because since this article was published, I wrote articles describing the difference between product teams vs feature teams, and product teams vs project teams.  And in those articles, I referenced the model described here as delivery teams.\nUPDATE 1: I just want to make very clear that I am in no way affiliated with any of the various Agile organizations or alliances.  We receive nor provide any funds to any of them.  That is our firm policy at SVPG.  My thoughts below are purely in the spirit of helping companies make informed choices on what processes or tools might best serve their needs.\nI was first introduced to Agile methods about 15 years ago, when I first encountered some product teams that were experimenting with new ways of producing software.  I’ve been a long-time student of processes and tools for product development, and since the origin of these methods were from the custom solutions/projects world, I was asked early on about my thoughts on how to leverage these methods for the product world.\nI was immediately attracted to several of the core principles of Agile, as they attempted to institutionalize several of what I considered the most important traits of the best product teams.\nWhile there’s lots of rituals around almost any process, the essence of Agile, from my perspective as it pertains to product teams, was really around two things: \nThe first, which usually gets the most attention, is the notion that it is better for us, and better for our customers, to release a steady stream of smaller releases – generally on the order of releasing every week or two (the more frequent the better).\nFor companies used to releasing monthly or even quarterly (the norm back then) this meant some big changes in how they built, tested and released their work.  While this was a non-trivial hurdle for many teams, which usually meant they had to invest in test and release automation, teams came out the other end better for it.\nThe second, less obvious but in my view the most profound, is that Agile would empower a team to actually go figure out how to solve a problem.  That may sound like it should have been obvious, but back then, this was generally not how the world worked. Instead, stakeholders would give the teams very specific lists of features to go implement (i.e. roadmaps) and then project managers would very explicitly assign and track tasks to specific people, and shepherd the release to production (output). \nSo while the first change represented a significant difference to how software was actually produced and released, the second change was more about how teams actually work and solve problems, and who takes responsibility for the outcome.\nThe first change didn’t really bother most companies.  Sometimes their marketing people struggled with the much more frequent releases, and sometimes customers struggled with change fatigue, but good techniques emerged to deal with these second-order effects.\nThe second change, however, is a different story.  The politics inside companies became clear with the second change. \nMany stakeholders were not comfortable turning over responsibility to the product teams, especially when they had ill-equipped “product owners” that were more about the process and the backlog, and much less about the deep knowledge of customers, data, business and industry necessary to enable the team to effectively solve hard problems in ways that worked for the business. \nSo then – and still today – in most companies, the stakeholders still provide the teams with roadmaps of what features and projects the stakeholders think best.  Even though the teams use Agile methods, the teams are not empowered and accountable in the sense I’m describing.  They are there to implement.\nBut aside from still getting the roadmaps, the teams were largely able to self-organize and run their teams as they best saw fit, which definitely has some significant benefits, including in productivity and team morale.\nBut there was another faction in most companies that was decidedly not happy with Agile.\nMost larger companies in the pre-Agile days had a fairly powerful organization called a “PMO” which stands for Program Management Office (program management is essentially project management for very large projects). \nThis is the group of project managers that are responsible for herding the cats (product, design, engineering, QA, operations, etc.) and ensuring that the roadmaps get delivered “on time and on budget.”  They are the personification of project-mindset organizations.\nWhen most companies moved to Agile, this PMO group was intentionally sidelined.  The argument was that the product teams should step up and take responsibility for this.\nIn some companies the PMO jobs were actually eliminated, but in others they were largely pushed aside from the software efforts and relegated to things like orchestrating moves from one building to another.\nAs you might imagine, this didn’t sit too well with the PMO organizations of the world, but the momentum behind Agile was too great, and the frustrations with the old ways of working too real, so they spent nearly a decade trying to figure out their place in the tech world.\nBut they have returned.\nOver the past few years, a number of companies have asked me about this notion of processes that focus on “Agile at Scale,” the most heavily marketed (judging in part by the amount of spam I receive) such process is SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework).\nNow I need to be clear on something here. \nNormally I only write about processes and techniques that I can vouch for first-hand.  The problem here is that I don’t personally know of a single leading tech product company that is using SAFe. \nSo while I have read the white papers, and watched the videos, and have spoken to many people now that have been trained on and been forced to use SAFe, everything I know about this is all second-hand.\nAll the examples I have found are big IT, project-mindset organizations – big banks and insurance companies – not technology-powered product-mindset companies – so not the type of company that I would normally work with.\nI will also admit to a strong bias.  From all that I have read and heard, I would not want to work in a company using a process like this.  I can’t imagine any of the strong tech product companies I know choosing to move to SAFe, and if for some reason they did, I’m pretty certain their top talent would leave.\nNow the people behind this process are pretty savvy.  Rather than a frontal assault on Agile, they take an “embrace and extend” marketing strategy, so you will find every buzzword you’ve ever heard from the Agile and Lean worlds including Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean Startup, Lean UX, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps.\nBut it’s just a marketing strategy.  Mostly they just redefine the meaning of these terms to obscure their purposes.  An Epic becomes a “mini business case;” the concept of governance sounds less onerous when called “lean governance;” and program management might cause less angst when positioned as “agile program management.”  The constant talk of iterations and agile obscures the reality that these “Agile Release Trains” are mostly happening every 10 weeks. \nI could go on, but hopefully you get the point.  The core benefits of Agile and Lean are lost.  More accurately, if you follow their process, I find it inconceivable that you’ll be able to achieve the underlying benefits of innovation that can come from effective use of Agile and Lean methods.\nA couple years ago I wrote about the root causes of product failure in product companies and I identified ten key attributes of Waterfall and project-mindset.  I went through and compared this list with SAFe, and literally all ten problems exist in SAFe.  Indeed, I would argue that all ten problems are inherent in that process.\nAt its most fundamental, the critical notion of a dedicated product team (aka squad) has been gutted.  In SAFe, this concept of a true product team has been undermined and demoted, and the core concept is now a Program, which has a top-down model of a product manager, an architect, and a release train manager, and these people make all the key decisions, and then some number of engineering teams with a low-level product owner are assigned various parts to build.\nThere are several variations of SAFe depending on just how big you are, and just how much command and control you want to put in place.  But if you were an old-school PMO missing your classic portfolio, program and project management, you would probably love it.\nThe bottom line is that SAFe is very much a top-down, mercenary model; the role of design and especially engineering is not nearly as strong as it needs to be; it’s all about output and not outcome; and the real consequence is the obstacles to continuous innovation.\nIn fairness, I can imagine some scenarios where a process like this might be appropriate (or at least not much worse than the alternatives):\nan organization where most, if not all, of the engineers are outsourced, using an agency or contractors\na big re-platforming effort (assuming the team had competently determined a suitable architecture and technology stack up front)\nan organization without true product managers or true product designers, and with very weak or inexperienced engineers\nFor large project-mindset organizations I can understand the appeal of the return to the command and control model, but for companies that depend on consistent innovation, and the critical role of engineering in invention and not just coding, I believe this represents a major step backwards.\nWhen I first heard of this process from someone that was working in a company (a large bank) that had adopted it, I told them it just sounded like the death throes of Waterfall and I was pretty sure it wouldn’t go anywhere.  But in truth their message seems to have resonated with project-mindset organizations, and just because it may cause an allergic reaction in Silicon Valley doesn’t mean it won’t get traction elsewhere.\nIn particular, just about every large pre-Internet company out there today has some sort of “digital transformation initiative,” but what most of them don’t realize is that the heart of this transformation is moving from project-mindset to product-mindset.\nWhen you combine the appeal of the message of “leveraging modern concepts of Agile and Lean” with the very real challenges that come with scale, it’s not too hard to see how big companies can fall prey to this marketing strategy, ironically often in the name of digital transformation.\nThe rise of these sorts of processes makes clear to me that large portions of the broader industry still don’t understand the difference between project-mindset and product-mindset, and so they don’t see the real value in Agile or Lean, or have such a superficial understanding that they’re easily swayed. \nSo I am going to redouble my efforts to help make these points.  Watch for several more articles on this topic of the differences between project-mindset and product-mindset teams and organizations.\nSpecial thanks for Jeff Patton for his comments on a draft of this article, and also to Ken Schwaber and Ron Jeffries for publishing their thoughts.\nNOTE: I received many questions after the publication of this article, and I posted the follow on: Scaling Agile FAQ.\nUPDATE SEPTEMBER 2020:\nThis article has now been out there for over two years, and has spread quite widely across the industry.  Hundreds of people have personally contacted me to tell me how this is unfortunately their reality, and their problems with SAFe were at least as bad as I described.\nInterestingly, thus far, not a single person has reached out to tell me that they have had much better experiences.  I did learn of one true product company, Fitbit, that at one point did try to use SAFe.  When I followed up someone I know there, I was told that they had abandoned the process, and the person that had persuaded the company to try it had left the company as well.  My friend was surprised to hear that the SAFe marketing site still lists them as a reference customer for the process.  Very telling.  I ended up describing their experiences here.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/revenge-of-the-pmo/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925960157,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Roadmap Alternative FAQ - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my prior article I discussed my favorite alternative to conventional product roadmaps.  That article seemed to strike a chord in people, and I received quite a bit of very positive feedback.  However, I also received more than a few questions. This didn’t really surprise me because as I said in the article, this is not a minor topic.  But in my back and forth with people, I realized that there were several common and often significant confusions, and sometimes, the discussions would expose a more serious misunderstanding about product and how product teams work.\nSo I decided to sort through the feedback and write up an FAQ of your most common questions.  Even if you didn’t have any questions on my prior article, I hope you’ll at least skim through these questions and answers in case something in there surprises you.\nQ: I am worried my “dev team” can only decide how best to build something, not what to build.\nWhenever I get this question, I always have to take a few breaths before I respond.  I consider this mindset of the product owner (or more generally, the CEO or stakeholders) as the only one that can determine what to build, as toxic to teams, and a major reason for the lack of innovation.  I’ve tried to explain many times that often the best single source of true innovation are our engineers.  That doesn’t mean every engineer is going to be like this, but the mindset where no engineers can do this is a very serious problem.  The engineers are working with the technology every day and are in the best position to see what’s just now possible.  They are also disproportionately very bright people.  When you combine this deep knowledge of technology, with a first-hand experience of the customer problems, great products can result.\nQ: What if the CEO is the product person?\nIn most startups, the product person is the CEO (or at least one of the co-founders).  There is nothing wrong with this, and in fact it’s my preferred scenario.  The key is to avoid the trap above where the CEO views the product team as just his “dev team” rather than the true product team.\nQ: What about outcome-based roadmaps?\nOutcome-based roadmaps refer to stating the outcome you are trying to achieve rather than the specific feature that may or may not deliver the necessary results.  This is very much what I am referring to here, with two differences, one substantial and the other more cosmetic.  The first is that the outcome is not actually enough context.  Product teams need the bigger picture as well, which is why I emphasized the importance of also having a comprehensive product vision.  The second difference is really a format difference.  I advocated the OKR model for describing the outcomes you’re after.  In truth, it’s not hard to map 1:1 a set of OKR’s to an outcome-based roadmap.\nQ: What about straightforward items (e.g. “keeping the lights on” items)?\nSeveral people asked if everything really needed to be expressed as outcomes, especially with what’s known as “keep the lights on” items.  These are those items that every company has to do as part of staying in business.  Bug fixes make up the bulk of this category, but this might include compliance items (“we need to start reporting xyz because of some financial reporting need”) or partnership items (“our partner needs us to implement a tracking pixel”).  And unless there’s real risk with any of these items, we typically just put these directly onto the product backlog.  We don’t worry about the outcome, and we don’t worry about validation.  We just knock these out.\nQ: What do we call the list of high-integrity commitments?\nIn the article I discussed high-integrity commitments.  If we don’t do conventional roadmaps, then where and how are these commitments communicated?  Some companies use the term “Plan of Record” (POR) for these special commitments.  This is a document that is managed by the delivery manager, but the only one that can typically add an item to this is the CTO/VP Engineering.  That’s because he or she is the person ultimately responsible for delivery.\nQ: What’s the difference between Product Scorecards and OKRs?\nMany of you know that I’ve been a long-time advocate of product scorecards.   A scorecard is a prioritized list of outcomes that defines “good” for a product.  For example, if you run an A/B test, it’s likely that you’ll have two different sets of results.  But often some numbers are better in one and some numbers better in the other.  So which is best?  The Product Scorecard helps you answer that.  So this is very related to OKR’s but a bit different.  The OKR’s describe the outcomes that the team is focusing on right now.  So they are both KPI-based, and they complement each other, but they serve different purposes.\nQ: How does this relate to “Theme-Based Roadmaps”\nTheme-based roadmaps have been around for more than 20 years.  The idea is that rather than have a somewhat random collection of features on your conventional roadmap each quarter, why not introduce a focus to the work and have a theme for the quarter.  An example would be to have a big focus on ease of use in Q1, and then a big focus on on-boarding in Q2, etc.   There was some confusion recently because Jared Spool published an article where he actually makes the case very well for outcome-based roadmaps, but for some reason he refers to the outcomes as “themes.”  He says he heard the term from a product person, but I’m guessing there was some confusion in there somewhere.  In any case, if you ignore his use of the term “themes” then it’s a very good summary of the benefits of what I’m talking about, in his case primarily from the perspective of user research.\nQ: How to wean an organization off of roadmaps?\nThe most common question of all was that teams want to move to the alternative I describe, but their organization is old-school and really addicted to the old quarterly product roadmap, so how do they transition their organization forward?  Here’s what I advocate in this case.  Plan on continuing with your existing roadmap process for 6-12 months.  However, starting immediately, every time you reference a roadmap item, or discuss it in a presentation or meeting, be sure to include a reminder on the business outcome that feature is intended to help.  If the feature you’re working on is to add a payment method, and the reason is to increase conversion, then be sure to always show the current conversion rate and the result you’re hoping to achieve.  Most importantly, after the feature goes live, be sure to highlight the impact on that conversion rate. If the impact was good, celebrate it.  If the impact was negligible, then emphasize to everyone that while you did ship the feature, the result was not there but you have other ideas on ways to get the desired result.   The goal is that over time (it can take as long as a year), the organization moves their focus from specific features launching on specific dates, to business results.\nQ: How about a complex example of this alternative to roadmaps working well?\nRecently the people at Radio Lab did a podcast of a team at Facebook doing product discovery on some very hard problems.  The podcast does a good job of showing how they work, and by focusing on the outcomes, the team zeros in on solutions.  I can’t help but contrast this with how most large companies would have instead created a product roadmap which as you’ll see would have been a complete waste of time and effort.  The podcast also raises some ethical questions, which are interesting but not critical to understanding discovery and the alternative to roadmaps.\nPlease continue to send me your questions.  I have articles coming on OKR’s and Product Vision so I will continue to try to clarify the issues.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/roadmap-alternative-faq/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925805867,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"SVPG Product Masterclass - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n“I loved every minute of this incredible opportunity to learn from the very best.

It tells me they are all about top-down control.  Most importantly, it tells me the leaders don’t understand what they need to do to compete against the likes of Amazon.\nWhat about the idea of using a process like SAFe as a first step towards where you describe?\nIn theory I want to like this argument.  I have seen many very strong teams start with Scrum and after 6-12 months moved on to more streamlined versions of Agile.  Scrum served a useful purpose for them, especially in establishing a little structure and discipline across the organization, but then the team realized they could work even better.\nBut moving to SAFe does not feel the same.  It is so big and heavy, much bigger and heavier than what good companies use.  And it doesn’t address the real issues that need to be addressed if the company wants to make meaningful progress.  Also concerning to me is that I have not found anyone that said they were successful in using it as this first step and then progressed on to a product-mindset model.\nWe’re not a startup; we’re a big company with lots of stakeholders and constraints.  Don’t we need to use a heavyweight process like this?\nLet’s consider three of my favorite enterprise-class tech companies: Google, Amazon and Netflix.  All three are at massive scale, very likely beyond anyone using SAFe.  Google alone has seven different products with more than a billion users each.  Amazon is an innovation machine, with products and services for consumers, businesses, and developers.  And Netflix continues to reinvent itself, bigger and better each time.\nAs I’m sure you can imagine, just like your company, they each have many stakeholders and many constraints.  Amazon and Google both also provide services to businesses, some of which are in regulated industries, so this introduces constraints on them too.\nNow each of these companies has their own favorite techniques, and each has a different company culture, but all three have built their businesses on the concept of hiring skilled people – especially engineers, designers and product managers – and then empowering them to solve hard problems. \nThat is why I can’t conceive of any of these companies ever moving to a process anywhere even close to SAFe.  Maybe more importantly, they are an existence proof that you don’t need to.\nIsn’t SAFe just a tool?  As such, can’t it be used for good or evil, like any tool?\nThis is one of the most dangerous misconceptions, that tools, frameworks and processes are somehow agnostic.  I am definitely planning to write more about this (update: I did write about this here), but it’s important to realize that tools, frameworks, methodologies and processes are all trying to encourage certain types of use and discourage other types of use.  I don’t necessarily mean this in a bad way.  Sometimes I love the behaviors they encourage (like Slack regarding team communication) and other times I hate the behaviors they are encouraging (like most roadmap tools).\nIt’s also true that any tool can be used incorrectly.  For example, I advocate the OKR system for focus, alignment and team empowerment, yet many teams don’t get the real value because they make the very common but serious mistake of putting output as their key results.\nBut it’s critical to realize that most tools are not agnostic.  Their creators are trying to facilitate a certain way of thinking or working.  You need to ensure that’s how you want to think or work.\nYou called out the PMO as personifying the project mindset.  Is all project and program management bad?\nMost definitely not.  The program/project mindset is the problem, however, there are many people out there today that are critically necessary when dealing with product at scale.  I am actually a big advocate for this role, but I prefer to refer to them now as Delivery Managers. \nWhat if we’re a regulated industry?\nThis is an orthogonal point.  I work with teams and companies in regulated industries and the constraints introduced apply whether they’re a startup, growth stage or enterprise.  Many people mistakenly believe that you can’t use modern practices in a regulated industry.  This is not true.  My partner Chris wrote an article about this recently.\nWhat do you mean by project-mindset vs. product-mindset?\nThis is really the core of the topic, and I have written several articles about this and I know I need to write several more.  In fact, maybe even a book.  Here are several places to learn more:\nhttps://svpg.com/product-vs-it-mindset/\nhttps://svpg.com/good-product-team-bad-product-team/\nhttps://svpg.com/product-fail/\nhttps://svpg.com/product-success/\nUpdate: I wrote a major piece on the topic here.\nWhat are the alternatives to SAFe?\nDan North reached out to me after I published this article and pointed me to an article he wrote on the same topic, but he spent more time talking about the alternative, and less time beating up on SAFe.  I thought his article is excellent and wish I had seen it earlier.\nI also describe the best practices I know of and advocate in my book: INSPIRED V2.  One of the main themes of the book is “Product @ Scale.”\nWhy is this topic even important?\nFirst, I will confess that as a product person, I’m fairly paranoid that someone else will come along and take my customers.  And today, more often than not, that someone is Amazon.  I know first hand that they are very good.  I also know that if your company has not learned how to leverage technology and put technology-powered innovation at the very heart of your company, then you will not be able to respond when they come after you.  I also believe they would love it if you continued to use SAFe, and they’re betting you will.\nI’d like to close this with a quote from Jeff Bezos’ annual shareholder letter:\n“If you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right.”\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/scaling-agile-faq/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925921837,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Scaling with Process vs. People - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my last article I provided an overview of the six major models of Product Ops that I have encountered (thus far), and I shared my views on each.  But while I highlighted the models that I consider dangerous or harmful, I didn’t elaborate on the root cause of the harmful models.\nIn this article I’d like to address what I believe is the root cause, as I think it is at the core of why so many companies, especially large companies, lose their product mojo, and end up prime targets for disruption.\nI can think of few topics more important to the ongoing success of a tech-powered product company than the question of how you can continue innovating as you grow?\nRecently, I wrote yet again about the dangers of process people.  At this point, most people know my views.  \nBut this is important enough that I’d like to take a moment to share with you some thoughts on this specific topic from several of the industry’s most successful product leaders:\nSteve Blank: \n“As companies and agencies get larger, they start to value the importance of process over the product.  And by product, I mean the creation of new hardware, services, software, tools, operations, tradecraft, etc. People who manage processes are not the same people as those who create product. … Over time as organizations grow, they become risk averse. The process people dominate management, and the product people end up reporting to them.”\nJeff Bezos:\n“As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2….A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations…The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?”\nSteve Jobs:\n“That’s what makes great products.  It’s not process; it’s content…The system is that there is no system. That doesn’t mean we don’t have process…But that’s not what it’s about.”\nElon Musk:\n“The problem is that at a lot of big companies, process becomes a substitute for thinking. You’re encouraged to behave like a little gear in a complex machine.”\nReed Hastings:\n“[The reason Netflix has been so successful is because it has] a culture that values people over process, emphasizes innovation over efficiency, and has very few controls. Our culture, which focuses on achieving top performance with talent density and leading employees with context not control, has allowed us to continually grow and change as the world, and our members’ needs, have likewise morphed around us.”\nSteve Blank:\n“Process is great when you live in a world where both the problem and solution are known. Process helps ensure that you can deliver solutions that scale without breaking other parts of the organization…These processes reduce risk to an overall organization, but each layer of process reduces the ability to be agile and lean and — most importantly — responsive to new opportunities and threats.”\nI’ve long argued that the best companies work very differently from the rest.  And while the differences are many, it all starts with their approach to this question of how to continue to innovate as they grow.\nAt this point, most of the large companies I meet already believe that they need to transform, but they don’t usually appreciate just how deep into their organization and their culture the differences run.\nI promise to spend more time writing about the nature of these differences.  But for now, I hope that the strong views expressed by these product leaders motivates you to consider viewing your organization through this lens of scaling with people rather than process.\nNOTE: If you have not read my earlier Process People articles and are wondering what is the alternative to scaling with process, I wrote an entire book describing how strong product companies scale via people.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/scaling-with-process-vs-people/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925847473,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Sling TV’s Need for Speed - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Christian Idiodi\nSling TV is an American streaming television service and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dish Network.  Back in mid-2015, Sling recognized the shift to cloud services and mobile technology and launched as the first OTT service provider. OTT services bypass cable, broadcast, and satellite television platforms to provide consumers with a less expensive but higher quality entertainment experience.\nFor Paddy Rao, Sling’s SVP for Strategy & Technology, transformation is nothing new for the company.  Instead, it’s something that had become standard practice throughout the organization.  \n“Sling has a tradition of reinventing itself. We invented the first pay-television market. Then we invented Sling TV, and now we’re inventing the 5G entertainment network. The rule of thumb for us is that if you stop transforming, you stop growing. Transformation is part of the journey. It’s the process by which we’re able to continually improve not only our company but our ability to serve the customer.   For us, transformation is not a one-off that just happens. Transformation is part of our DNA.”\nSpeed Was the Motivator\nToday’s world moves so fast that it isn’t enough to simply meet customer expectations. If Sling wants to provide the best possible service, then it has to anticipate expectations and run ahead of them.\nFor an engineering organization, this translates into the need for speed.  Even though they were fast before, they have to continually get faster.   Speed allows Sling to iterate, to test, and to learn from its mistakes.  “On average, we are now about 50 to 100 times faster than we were two years ago,” says Paddy Rao. “Today, we’re able to meet our customers’ needs literally on demand, on a daily basis, sometimes on an hourly basis.  \nOne area that benefits directly from Sling TV’s commitment to speed is Site Reliability Engineering. This defines how an engineering organization should run its business. For most people, television is not just entertainment. It’s an essential service. It’s how they stay connected with what happens around the world. It’s a critical part of their lives. This means that Sling TV has to be up and running and instantly available 24 x7.\nA Speed-Driven Culture\nFor Sling TV, transformation is not just about speed.  Speed is the outcome.  The real driver is culture.  To support and promote its culture, Sling created an acronym: CPAW.  This stands for curiosity, pride, adventure, and winning.  Alignment with these core values is something Sling looks for in every employee. Sling wants people who are curious about their customers; about their preferences and problems and their ever-changing needs.  They also want their people to be willing to take chances and try new things.\nAccording to Paddy Rao: “The journey is the challenge. It never ends. You can never stop transforming yourself.  Sling TV is a growing enterprise.  The transformation is in force all the time.  Which is why we’re hiring all the time.   We’re constantly looking to improve.  We’re not the folks we were even a year ago, and a year from now we won’t be who we are today.  That’s how fast things change. And it’s all for the better.”\nListen to related

Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNote: This is an article intended for those considering writing a non-fiction book.  \nNotes on Authoring Non-Fiction Books\nWHY ME?\nWhy should I write about publishing?  \nI have now published three books, and the first two have sold well over 100,000 copies, and the recently released third book is well on its way to reaching this milestone.  Since most books sell only a few thousand copies, which doesn’t even recoup the publisher’s costs, my understanding is that this record is relatively rare.  \nSo perhaps there may be something to the approach that could be worth sharing.\nI certainly don’t consider myself an expert on publishing, however, over the past few years I have been approached by dozens of aspiring authors asking me about the process I used on my own books, and often to review their manuscripts, or at the least, to review their books in hope of receiving an endorsement.\nPublishing a book is a huge project, much harder and much more time consuming than most people think.  I have real respect for anyone that gets to the point of a complete rough draft of a manuscript. \nUnfortunately, with most books I review, it’s clear to me the book has no hope of achieving the author’s, or the publisher’s, goals.  \nWhich is very sad because I know first-hand how much time and effort goes into any full manuscript, and in so many cases, these failures were avoidable.  \nThis note is all about giving authors a better chance of achieving their goals.\nKeep in mind that my lens is a product lens.  \nI view the book as your product, and the readers are your customers.  If you think of the book as your product, then your goal is to discover, produce and distribute a successful product, and we have many techniques to help us.\nIt’s important to emphasize that, at least from what I can tell, no amount of marketing can make up for a weak book.\nOn the other hand, if your book succeeds in meeting a real need, your readers will eagerly and happily spread the word.  Marketing moves from trying to overcome the limitations of the book, to providing an accelerant to reach.\nCAVEATS:\nI want to be clear that I’m not talking here about writing fiction, and I’m not talking about vanity publishing (either personal or corporate).  Many people and businesses publish books for different reasons, such as to give away as a sales tool, or to try to impress prospective clients.  That is a marketing tool, and not what I’m talking about here.\nThis note is for people interested in publishing a non-fiction book that meets a real need in the market, where the author’s primary goals are reach and impact.\nPlease also note that I’m not suggesting this is the only process that will generate a successful book.  I’m just sharing that this is the process I used with my three books, and I’m also trying to point out how we leverage many of the same techniques we use for tech-powered products.\nARE YOU UP FOR THIS?\nMany people are unsure if they have what it takes to write a book.  I suggest that they give themselves a little test:\nCreate a 6-page written narrative about some topic related to your area of expertise.  If you’ve never written a written narrative, check out this article.  \nBut remember it’s not enough just to write it.  You have to iterate on it, then show it to a true expert that can give you honest feedback, and then you need to continue to iterate to address the weak areas.\nIf the process of writing, iterating and especially getting critical feedback is not something you want to deal with, then save yourself a lot of grief and find some other project.\nWhat makes this hard, and a good test for a book, is that the written narrative lays bare your argument, for the reader to see and judge.  There is no hiding behind a PowerPoint presentation, and no ambiguous little sound bites like on Twitter.  If you don’t know what you are talking about, it will be clear to any knowledgeable reader.\nA book is like a written narrative times 100.  You’re putting it out there not just for a friendly reader, but for any reader.  You are giving up control over who sees and judges you, and for how long.  And if that’s not enough pressure, if you are writing this as a leader of a company or group, then you are also putting the reputation of your company on the line.\nYou will also need to consider honestly whether you have the time that’s necessary for a book project.  Each of my three books took roughly 2 years of ongoing work, where I’d say I was putting in on average 1-3 hours a day.  And remember that even after publication, there’s an ongoing cost to promoting and nurturing the book as it spreads through the community.\nI want to stress that with a book project, it’s not just time at a computer writing.  There’s a tremendous amount of thinking time needed to work out what you want to say, and how you want to make the points.  \nI used to struggle with that, but I learned how to adjust my schedule to accommodate this.  For example, before I take the dogs for a walk in the woods, I will pick a specific topic I’m in the process of writing about, and intentionally concentrate on that topic during the walk.  This gives me a solid, quality hour to consider issues each day.\nRealistically, it is this commitment of time that probably discourages most people from pursuing a book project.  Obviously I can’t manage your time for you, but I will note that more than a few people I’ve encouraged to consider writing a book have told me they simply don’t have the time, yet they appear to be on social media non-stop.  This is certainly an issue for many people.  \nBut if you don’t think you can free up on average 1-3 hours a day for at least a year, a book may not be for you.\nTHE TWO PREREQUISITES\nA good book boils down to two big things, one of which I can help you with, and the other I can’t.\nFirst and foremost, you need to have something to say.  \nWhile this sounds obvious, most books just don’t say anything new, or they don’t say anything in a meaningfully new or different way.  \nYou don’t need to be sharing a new world-changing theory, but you do need to have something of substance to share.\nIt is remarkable how often I will read a draft of a book where the author thinks they’ve discovered something amazing, yet it’s something that’s been well known for many years.\nOr worse, I see too many manuscripts where the author has read and clearly liked several other books, so he feels compelled to share what he learned from those other authors in his own book.\nThis is the part that I can’t help you with.  I can point out when something is not new, or not meaningful, but I can’t provide you something meaningful to say.\nSecond, you need to say it in a way that is clear and compelling.\nThis is the part where lots of help is available.  If you have something meaningful to say (again, that’s a big ‘if’), then there are many good resources to help you get the narrative into fighting shape.\nFor nearly every manuscript I have ever read, including all of my own, they need plenty of copy edit help.  The publisher will provide (at least one) copy editor, but for each of my three books, I additionally contracted with a professional copy editor before I submitted the manuscript to the publisher.\nI did this because voice (described in more detail below) is very important in my writing, and I wanted to utilize a copy editor earlier in the process, one that knows me and my writing voice, so that I could be sure to maintain that voice.\nFor some writers, especially those that are new to writing, or where English is not their first language, they may need the help of a developmental editor.  This help happens very early in the writing process and can help the author structure and communicate her main points.\nSome people believe you can effectively outsource the entire writing process, by hiring a ghostwriter that interviews the “author” and/or reviews their presentations or notes or whatever they may have to work with, and then writes from there.\nI have personally never seen a good book produced this way, but I do not consider this the fault of the ghostwriter.  It goes back to whether or not the author really has something to say.  A presentation, or a sound bite, does not provide the substance for a book.  In fact, in my experience, this type of book makes very clear how little substance there really is.\nBut the point is, if you have something to say, you can definitely get the necessary help to turn this into readable, compelling prose.\nJust to set your expectations, on my most recent book, when I provided my first complete rough draft to my copy editor, a couple weeks later he returned the 400 plus page manuscript to me with more than 8000 copy edits.  In my experience, that’s not unusual.\nIf you compare one of my blog articles (which don’t go through a copy edit process) with the corresponding chapter in one of my books, it’s not hard to see the difference.  Both have the same voice and style, but the book chapter is more concise, clear, grammatically correct and impactful.\nI will say that writing well is a skill that can absolutely be developed.  Mainly by writing frequently and consistently.  I’ve read a handful of books on the art of writing, but by far my favorite is On Writing by Stephen King.  But while writing well is an advantage, I’ve seen quite a few extremely good and successful books where it’s amazing the difference between the rough draft I reviewed, and the final product.  So when I review a book, I’m looking at the substance, and trusting that the editing process will deal with the prose.\nSo those are the two critical components of a successful book.  And to be clear, most books fail because of the first issue.\nBut I hope that this doesn’t intimidate you.  I know that many people have a form of imposter syndrome, and they don’t believe they have something new and meaningful to say.  But often they do. \nIn fact, there are multiple books out there where I personally felt very strongly that the author did have something important to say, and I pressed the author (sometimes for years) to share what they know in a book.  \nThere are several other potential authors I’m pressing even as I write this.\nThat said, one of the first and most important steps to writing a book is to test out whether or not you really do have something to say, which we’ll talk about next.\nCONCEPT TESTING\nPublishers will push you for an outline, and probably some sample chapters.  But this is just because they don’t know any better.  \nYour outline can and should change constantly, as you flesh out topics, and start to get feedback.\nYou will discover missing topics.  You will decide other topics are redundant.  You will decide to reorder.  You will break some topics up, and combine others.  \nThe last thing you want to do is close your mind to these changes prematurely.\nInstead, use a product discovery technique.  Create a concept MVP for this book.  That might take the form of an article on a blog or platform like Medium or LinkedIn.  Or it might be an industry conference presentation.  Or it could be a 6-page narrative.  \nSummarize your major points.  What is the big idea (or set of ideas) behind this book?  Then get feedback.  \nFor my most recent book, I created a keynote presentation for a major conference, and I also wrote and published an associated article.  \nI told the people at the conference that I was considering expanding on this topic in an upcoming book, and to let me know their thoughts on that.  I received both quantitative and qualitative feedback.  \nFrom publishing an article I was able to track reach and engagement.  From reading the follow-up questions that were emailed to me and shared on social media, I was able to get a better sense of what topics were clear, and which ones needed to be developed further.\nOnce I had confidence there was real demand for this new book, I experimented with how to position this book relative to my earlier book.  I also experimented with titles and subtitles.\nOnly after this did I start to think about the book’s structure (technically, the information architecture of the book).  Some topics were immediately clear, and others did not become clear until nearly a year later.  In fact, my co-author and I decided to add two major sections (of the final ten major sections) in the final weeks before finishing the manuscript.  It wasn’t until the full book really started to come together that we realized we had some significant gaps.\nTHE THREE TYPES OF REVIEWERS\nThere are three distinct types of reviewers that are each critically important, and one of the most common mistakes authors make is not realizing the difference.\n1. TARGET AUDIENCE REVIEWERS\nThis is your customer.  This is who the book is for.  You should be very clear, and very specific, on who this is.  And who it is not.  You will need at least a dozen of these people to volunteer to read drafts of chapters.  Today, with even minimal online participation, you can usually find hundreds or even thousands of volunteer readers.\nWhile your target audience is critical and we are truly grateful for their help, they are not experts.  They are looking to you as the expert.  \nSo they can’t be expected to be able to tell you what to fix in your drafts.  If you listen closely, you’ll get lots of clues, especially from their questions, but this group of readers does not have the answers.  You’ll need to look elsewhere for the best ways to correct issues.\n2. EXPERT REVIEWER\nIt is absolutely critical to have at least one, trusted, expert reviewer.  This is someone that you know is truly an expert in the topic, and also someone you trust will be completely candid with you.  This role is a very big responsibility, as you are counting on this person to literally review every word, and in many cases, save you from yourself.\nAll you really need is one of these people, but if you are fortunate enough to have two or even three such people, even better.\nNote that sometimes there are specific topics in the book that are outside of your expert reviewer’s area of expertise.  For these, you would want to identify specialists to serve the expert reviewer role.  For my own writing, I have a fairly deep bench of people I can call on for a range of expertise, covering product, design, engineering, data science, user research, agile methods, and more.\nBut please be warned: without at least one such person, you will very likely not learn of significant errors and flawed arguments until after the book has been published.  And this is usually an author’s biggest fear.  Remember, there’s no hotfix for a serious mistake in a printed book.\n3. INFLUENCER REVIEWERS\nWhen it comes to non-fiction books, influencers matter a great deal.  Many in the target audience look to these influencers to decide if a book is worthwhile.  \nIn a working backwards sense, when your book is released, you want to have a set of these influencers (at least 4-6 of them) that have read your book, and sincerely consider it valuable, and are willing to tell others how they feel.\nInfluencers are often experts, but sometimes they are just well known and well respected, even if they’re not necessarily an expert.  They may not have the time or inclination to be your expert reviewer (again, that is a big commitment), but they will often be willing to review a manuscript draft and share their opinion with you, and often point out a few areas needing some work.  \nIt is worth taking this feedback very seriously, and ensuring they know you appreciate their feedback, and will incorporate it.  Keep in mind that influencer feedback requires far less time and effort than the expert reviewer will put in, but it is still non-trivial.\nThe most common mistake I see in terms of reviewers is just having a group of target readers, and not having an expert reviewer, or a set of influencer reviewers.\nCONTENT DEVELOPMENT\nThis is where the largest chunk of time is required.  You need to create the actual content.\nAt this point, you should have an initial outline, and you should have identified at least one expert reviewer, and a set of target reader reviewers.\nI read quite a few non-fiction books, and after I finish most of them, I often think the author could have said the same thing in an article. \nMy goal in my own writing is to leave the opposite impression.  I want people to say that there was so much value in this book, that each chapter could have been its own book.  \nSo for me, every chapter must be able to carry its own weight, or it shouldn’t be there.  \nBut how to know?\nThere are some people that point out (correctly) that you don’t need to buy my books, you can find early versions of most chapters in the form of blog articles.  \nAnd some less than generous people think all I do is string the articles together into a series and publish the result as a book.\nBut what’s really going on is that they are seeing the process of content development. \nEach blog article is an MVP for a hoped-for chapter in an upcoming book.  \nFor each article, I want to test whether the topic is:\nValuable – the most important risk for a chapter – does it provide real value?\nUsable – can people understand what I’m trying to say?\nFeasible – is it too much or too complex for a single article? \nViable – is it correct, is it defensible, is it ethical, is it consistent with our brand?\nBy posting the article and sharing it with a broad group of readers (at a minimum it’s intended to be shared with the target reader reviewers), I am able to assess each of these four risks.\nSome articles get a good response, some generate questions I really should have anticipated (in which case I update the content in order to address these questions proactively), and some articles clearly don’t resonate, so they’re either jettisoned, or maybe I take another run at the topic.\nThe result of this process is that by the time I decide to convert an article into a book chapter, I have real evidence that this chapter will indeed carry its own weight.\nNow, about 70% or so of my book chapters have gone through this process.  For the ones that did not, there are various reasons.  Some chapters exist to tie together other concepts, so they aren’t meant to stand alone.  Others need to be viewed as part of a larger whole in order to make sense.  \nBut for anything I’m nervous about, I make sure it goes through this process.\nWhile this process helps to develop and improve the chapter content, the feedback also helps to improve the overall structure of the book.\nVOICE\nI’m not certain if this is important for all non-fiction books, but for my books, I consider voice very important.  \nRealize that all of my writing, in one way or another, is a form of coaching.  I’m trying to help others learn from what I’ve learned over the years.  \nAnd effective coaching is based on trust.  I want the reader to feel like they know me, and they can sense my sincere intention to try to help them.\nSo I don’t want my writing to come across like a sterile textbook.  I’m not trying to write scholarly articles for peer-reviewed journals.  I’m not trying to argue my case in a court of law.\nI’m trying to have a very honest conversation about difficult topics with the reader.\nSo my writing is very intentionally trying to convey this.  I try to write as I would talk to the reader, if we were sitting down face to face.\nI have discussed this intention and this voice specifically with my copy editor, and I told him my goal was to fix the grammar and punctuation, and improve the clarity and impact, but I wanted to try to maintain that voice.\nI think many authors get frustrated because they are not explicit about the voice they want to project, and as soon as they see the edits from the copy editor, they feel like the book may now be grammatically correct, but it’s somehow lost authenticity.\nONE VS. MULTIPLE AUTHORS\nIn my first two books, I was the sole author.  I felt very strongly about control of the book, mainly because I knew I had strong opinions both on content and on publishing, and many of those were contrarian opinions.\nHowever, for the third book, I invited my long-time SVPG Partner, Chris Jones, to be my co-author.  That turned out to be a great decision (at least on my part – hopefully he would agree).\nChris has served as my expert reviewer for many years, and continues to do so to this day, as he has long demonstrated the ability to quickly and consistently zero in on each of the weak areas, and he’s also proven he’s not afraid to criticize me on anything at all.\nHe is always constructive, so I never have taken his criticisms personally, and it usually only takes me a few seconds to realize the truth of his comments and observations.\nSo to have him as a co-author meant nearly immediate feedback while developing difficult content, which was exceptionally valuable.\nI think what was essential for Chris and I was that, very early on, we discussed openly what we would do if we disagreed, and how we would resolve.  Even though we had worked together for many years, this was a different relationship, so we made sure we were on the same page.\nWe agreed that we should both believe in the truth of every sentence, but we also believed that the book needed to have a single, clear, unambiguous voice.  We each had topics we felt strongly about writing, but we each agreed to be the expert reviewer for the other.\nThe specifics of how we worked together are less important, I think, than the fact that we discussed and agreed beforehand.\nBut I know of many co-author arrangements that have not gone well.  In most cases, the book reads like a problem of too many cooks in the kitchen.  \nJust as with having three different designers, where each is designing a different part of an app, it can come across as a mess to the user of that app.  I find the same in books.  \nIf you decide to have multiple authors, don’t just “divide and conquer” – ensure that one of you takes responsibility for the overall book.\nMILESTONE: FIRST COMPLETE DRAFT\nThe first truly meaningful milestone for a book developed this way, is when you have the first full rough draft of the content.\nAt this point, while the individual chapters have been reviewed and feedback incorporated, this is the first time the book as a whole can be evaluated.\nIt is normal, once you can see the book holistically, to reorder or restructure topics.  I also do my first (of what will be many) front-to-back review and edit of the full set of content.  \nIt is also normal to make fairly major changes to the manuscript at this stage.  While you’ve been working on individual chapters, once they come together and you can evaluate the whole, front to back, it changes your perspective.\nNow is where I like to do the first copyedit pass.  I’m about to take the time of my expert reviewer, and I don’t want the person distracted by my bad grammar or style issues.  This normally takes a few weeks.\nOnce I have reviewed and incorporated the copy edits, I’m ready to share this rough draft with my expert reviewer.  The person will need a few weeks, and during this time, assuming the person you have identified is truly expert in the topic, you’re preparing mentally for real criticism.\nOnce the feedback is received, there will be some amount of time, perhaps significant, to consider and incorporate the feedback.  The expert reviewer is the one person where I don’t ignore or dismiss any of the feedback.  I might not fix the issue the way the expert reviewer suggested, but I will address each issue one way or another.\nNow the book is ready for distribution to the influencer reviewers.  At this point the manuscript is looking pretty solid, but it still has not been delivered to the publisher, so it’s still relatively easy to change.\nThe influencer reviewers will need roughly two weeks to review.  We realize that not all of them will read the full manuscript.  Some will just skim.  But that’s okay, as the person we were really depending on for accuracy is the expert reviewer.  \nIt’s important that the influencers feel like they had the opportunity to review, and that you acknowledged their feedback.\nAfter incorporating the influencer feedback, send the draft for the second copy edit review.  After reviewing and incorporating the copy edits, the manuscript is now ready for delivery to the publisher.\nDECISION: SELF-PUBLISH OR PUBLISHING HOUSE\nAt this point, there is a fork in the road.  You will need to decide if you are going to self-publish, or work through a publishing house.\nThere are many pros and cons for each path, and discussing all of them would be another note entirely, but I will say that I’ve done both, and the differences between the self-publishing and publishing house routes are getting smaller.\nMy first book was self-published, mainly because I did not think the publisher knew what was best for my type of book, and I wanted the control to create and publish the book the way I considered best.  And in truth, I had much less negotiating power in the relationship.\nBecause of the success of the first book, it made the publishing house for my next book feel comfortable going with my judgement, even though my process was unconventional for them.\nBottom line is that self-publishing services are getting significantly better, and publishing houses are doing less (for example, they provide virtually no marketing or promotion assistance).  But there are still advantages to each.\nThat said, most new authors don’t really have a choice, because they don’t have a publishing house that wants to publish them.   \nAs a side note, if some alleged “publisher” approaches you and wants to charge you any type of fee in order to publish your book, then this is not a publishing house.  It’s just a self-publishing company’s marketing strategy to get you to pay for their help to self-publish.  It’s most likely a scam.\nThe good news is that there are many good services available to help you with all aspects of the self-publishing process, and so long as you stay on top of the process, and make sure you are distributing your book at least through Amazon, then you can make sure most of the world can find and buy your book.\nIf you do have the choice, it really comes down to a trade-off between how much revenue per book you get (or lose), versus how much of the work you want to be responsible for (design, production, distribution, global rights, etc.).\nIf the book is good, and you end up achieving decent volume, you will make more money by self-publishing.  If the book is not good, you will be absorbing all the costs, instead of the publishing house.\nBut it’s also true that if the book is good, there’s a lot of ongoing printing, distribution and international rights to deal with, so a publishing house can manage that for you.\nThere is some amount of prestige associated with name-brand publishing houses, but that amount is small and decreasing.  The book industry has become much closer to a true meritocracy, which I consider a very good thing.  There are many examples today of truly excellent and successful books that have been self-published.\nMILESTONE: MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION\nWhether you use a publishing house or self-publish, once you submit the full manuscript, there is a roughly 6 month process until the book is on shelves.\nThere is a great deal still to be done:\nExterior Design\nInterior Design\nPage Layout\nAdditional Copy Editing\nPage Proof Review\nAnd of course countless details like author photos, images, endorsements, cover quotes, rights releases, index, and more.\nAll told, you will likely need to re-read the full book cover to cover about 10 times.  It’s brutal.  Even if you thought the book was awesome when you submitted the manuscript, by six months later you’ll be very tired of looking at it.\nNo matter which path – self-publishing or publishing house – one thing I’ve found is that if you care about your book’s quality, you as the author will need to review everything very closely.  \nIt is remarkable and distressing how many mistakes are made, and how inefficient old-industries can be.  The established publishing industry is being disrupted and when you go through the publishing process, it’s not hard to see why.\nBOOK FORMATS\nToday, there are three popular and important formats, and they each meet different needs, so I consider all three to be necessary:\nPrint (hard or soft cover)\nDigital (Kindle or other viewer)\nAudio (Audible or other player)\nThe print and digital will be handled from the same source, but recording the audio version is a different effort.\nFor non-fiction books, I believe it’s important to have the author record the audio rather than a contract narrator.  Obviously not every author has suitable skills or voice, but I believe most do, or at least most authors can be coached to the point where they can do a good job.\nFor my first book, my publisher preferred a professional narrator, but Audible preferred I record as the author, so I did it myself.  It worked out well enough, but I did learn that there was much I did not know about professional narration, and I made a mental note that for any future books I would get some narrator coaching.\nFor my most recent book, I did that, and it was an excellent investment.  I had three, one hour coaching sessions, scheduled for the weeks before recording the book, and the result was clearly better, and that has been reflected in the audio format reviews on “performance.”\nLAUNCH AND PROMOTION\nYou might have thought you were finally done with this book project, but in many ways, you’re just getting started.\nYou also might think that if you went with a publishing house, this is where they take over and market your book.  If that’s your impression, I am sorry to be the one to tell you, but unlike in the past, publishers do virtually no marketing at all.  This is all on the author.\nIn fact, when a publisher evaluates whether they want to publish a particular author, the single biggest factor they’re looking for is whether you already have built a community of followers that you can market and sell to.  You essentially need to convince the publisher that you have the ability to market your book effectively.\nThat said, if you’ve done your job with the influencer reviewers, you should have an impressive set of endorsement quotes, and that will hopefully get your book off on the right foot.\nOf particular note is the jacket copy.  This is essentially the landing page for your book, and it’s worth making a special effort to get this copy as compelling as possible.  \nIn my experience, the publisher doesn’t really have the skills to do this well for non-fiction books (they don’t have the necessary in-depth knowledge of your target readers), so the author needs to dedicate significant time.\nIn my experience, the real engine of sustained sales is word of mouth, and that happens when people read your book, and then they like the book enough that they write something up to tell others – that might be as an Amazon review, or a Tweet, or a LinkedIn post or a Medium article, or a talk on Clubhouse, or a podcast, or any number of similar platforms.  \nBut those are the real engines of sustained sales.  These flywheels can keep generating new sales and new readers for many years (my first book had continually growing sales for literally ten years, until it was replaced with an all-new second edition).  Sales should rise year over year.  \nIf the book has an initial bump, but then rapidly declining sales, that’s a sign the book just isn’t resonating with people.  And of course, that’s what we have been working hard to avoid.\nWhile the word of mouth dynamic is the key, I don’t mean to say you can’t help.\nFor a book to reach its full potential in terms of reach and impact, it needs to be nurtured.\nI personally am very turned off by overt marketing by authors shamelessly plugging their book.  I much prefer to let others (especially experts and influencers) do the talking.\nHowever, if people want to talk about my books, and they’d like my help, I certainly want to help them do that.  I constantly give conference talks, podcast interviews, book club talks, and more.  \nWhen people share reviews I post a comment thanking them for sharing their thoughts.  When people reference the book or share a quote I try to make a point of “liking” the comment.  \nI am not a big fan of social media, so I don’t spend much time on this (not as much as I probably should) but I do want to show that I’m engaged and I’m grateful, so that means an ongoing commitment of time, mainly on Twitter and LinkedIn.\nThere’s obviously more that can be said regarding marketing and promotion, but I really do believe that the best use of your time is on creating a good book in the first place, so I want to keep the emphasis there.\nASKING FOR MY HELP\nIt’s possible that you’re reading this document because you are considering asking for my help in some way.  If so, let me describe the different forms of help, and what I can and can’t do:\n– Some people ask me to be an expert reviewer for their work.\nAs you can hopefully see now, that is a big commitment of my time and effort.  There are two things I am evaluating.  First, is this an area that I think I know well enough to serve as an expert reviewer?  Second, do I believe the author has something to say?  That is of course subjective, but I will use whatever information I have to try to judge that.\nAssuming it’s a fit, I then try to determine what stage the author is at in the process.  If they think they are nearly done, then I know they won’t be open to significant changes this late in the process, and this is really a request for an influencer review.  On the other hand, if the manuscript is not developed enough, there may not be enough to review.\n– Some people ask me to be an influencer reviewer for their work.\nThis is the most common request, and first I try to decide if I have the necessary expertise.  If so, I explain to the author that the way I work is that I’ll read the book, and if I think it’s good, I’ll happily provide an endorsement.  However, if I don’t think the book is good, I will share that privately with the author, and I try to explain why, but I won’t provide an endorsement.  If I like a book I’m vocal about it, but if I don’t, I just choose to remain silent on it.\nIt’s very common in the publishing industry that authors will often issue blanket quotes (or even let others write those quotes for them) in exchange for others saying nice things about their book.  I don’t participate in this.\nIn my work, it’s critical that my recommendations be genuine.  I need my readers to trust that when I recommend or endorse a book, it is going to be worthwhile.  However, when a book is truly good, I am giving my readers a real gift in recommending it.\n– Others ask me about the publishing process, and that of course is now meant to be addressed with this note.  But if there is something further you think I can help with, feel free to contact me.\nIn every case, I try to ask the author if they are looking for feedback or not.  Some are, and others aren’t.  I’ve learned that if the author is not interested in feedback, to be clear on that up front.\nAll that said, I love to discover great books, both for my own edification, and also to share with those I think would also benefit.  So I believe I am more willing than most to spend the time reviewing manuscripts, and encouraging potential authors.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/so-you-want-to-write-a-book/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925877842,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"SpamFireWall is checking your browser and IP

Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI thought I was done with the series of articles on the importance of empowered engineers, but then an article came out a few days ago criticizing the Spotify model of Agile at scale, and I could not pass up the opportunity to try to turn this into a teachable moment.\nThe author criticizes the Spotify model of scaled Agile, but neglects to mention that Spotify built a company now worth more than $25B, while competing – and often winning – against both Apple and Amazon, two of the very best product companies in the world.\nAnd then the author goes further, and recommends instead considering the process adopted at Fitbit for scaling Agile, but neglects to mention that immediately after they did, the company’s value proceeded to plunge from over $10B to less than $2B.\nThere’s a lot of talk today about focusing on outcomes, but here’s a chance for people to see quite clearly the difference between output and outcomes. \nThat said, this does raise some important questions:\nFirst, did Spotify succeed because of the process they used?  And did Fitbit suffer because of the process they used?  There’s really no way to know for sure but the theory I argued in Empowered Product Teams and The Most Important Thing would explain both Spotify’s success as well as Fitbit’s struggles (more on that below).\nSecond, even if we ignore the actual business results, what about the specific criticisms of the Spotify model that were called out in the article?  Are they fair criticisms?  I think they are, and in fact in 2013 I raised those very same concerns to leaders at Spotify.  \nBut what the article fails to mention, is that what they got right at Spotify was much more important than what they got wrong.\nIf you peel away all the Agile process talk, pithy nomenclature, and clever videos, the core of the way teams work at Spotify is empowered product teams, and especially empowered engineers.  In particular, the level of autonomy given to those engineers.   At Spotify, the dial for autonomy is set all the way to 10.\nWhile I am all about empowered product teams, and I love setting the dial relatively high on autonomy, it is easy to point out the inevitable inefficiencies that arise when individual autonomy is set so high, and management and leadership is set so low.\nBut the Spotify leaders explained to me that they were aware of this trade-off, and they considered this an acceptable price to pay for the benefits of fully empowered teams and engineers.  The Spotify leaders also explained to me that this choice was in part a reflection of Swedish engineering culture.\nI left the discussions fully believing that Spotify would need to adjust how they work to deal with the consequences of the weak role of management and leadership, especially as they grew (which they have indeed addressed in several aspects, creating that difference between what was evangelized and what they evolved to), but that overall I was not worried about them, because it was clear their business depended on consistent innovation, and they were doing what I considered the most important things to nurture that.\nIt’s worth noting that I’ve had the same discussions with teams at Google where they also set the autonomy dial very high.  In fact, it was Spotify and Google that inspired my series of articles from 2015 discussing the trade-offs involved with autonomy:  Autonomy vs. Leverage, Autonomy vs. Mission, Autonomy vs Ownership and Autonomy vs. Initiatives.  I also have published articles to encourage Spotify and others to raise their game in product management and product design to be as good as their engineering.\nIn stark contrast, at Fitbit, the company that the author cited as having a process he liked better for scaling Agile, they adopted the polar opposite of the empowered team model.  This process uses delivery teams rather than empowered product teams, and if I’m right about the necessity of truly empowered engineers for innovation, while you might see an increase in output, you would expect to see a serious drop in the amount of innovation, and then in business results, especially in an innovation-driven market like wearable technology.  And sadly for Fitbit, after they adopted this process in 2015, that’s precisely what we have witnessed.\nIs Fitbit’s decline due to these reasons?  Impossible to know for sure, especially since I don’t personally work with them, but I find it absolutely inexplicable that they would move to the process they did.  And my understanding is that the leaders behind this ill-conceived move are no longer there.\nNow to be clear, while I do consider Spotify a strong example of empowered product teams, the process for scaling Agile they promoted several years ago is not what I personally advocate, nor what I am writing about in my new book, however, it’s critical to keep all this in perspective, and you could do far worse than to adopt Spotify’s model of scaled Agile.\nSo I hope that people don’t take the wrong lessons away from both Spotify and Fitbit.  Most of us would absolutely love to have the degree of ongoing success that Spotify has earned.  \nRather than obsessing over process details, you should be looking for the deeper truths that have fueled their record of innovation.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/spotify-vs-fitbit/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925841118,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Startup Product Management - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI’ve been working with quite a few startups over the past few years, usually in an advisory capacity, but sometimes more directly involved. Startups are essentially all about new product creation, so they’re a terrific place for product managers to do their thing, and it’s why I love working with startups so much. Yet I believe that the prevalent model for how startups go about coming up with their first product is terribly inefficient, and why so many otherwise good ideas never get funded or make it to market.\nHere’s how it typically works. Someone with an idea gets some seed funding, and the first thing he does is hire some engineers to start building something. The founder will have some definite ideas on what he wants, and he’ll typically act as product manager and often product designer, and the engineering team will then go from there. The company is typically operating in “stealth mode” so there’s little customer interaction. It takes much longer for the engineering team to build something that originally thought because the requirements and the design are being figured out on the fly.\nAfter 6 months or so, the engineers have things in sort of an alpha or beta state, and that’s when they first show the product around. Things rarely go well in this first viewing, and the team starts scrambling. The run-rate is high because there’s now an engineering team building this thing as fast as they can, so the money is running out, and the product isn’t there. Maybe the company gets more funding and a chance to get the product right, but often they don’t. Many startups try to get more time by outsourcing the engineering to a low-cost off-shore firm, but it’s essentially the same process with the same problems.\nHere’s a very different approach to new product creation, one that costs dramatically less and is much more likely to yield the results you want. The founder hires a product manager, a product designer, and a prototyper. Sometimes the designer can also serve as prototyper, and sometimes the founder can serve as the product manager, but one way or another, you have these three functions lined up – product management, product design, and prototyping – and the team starts a process of very rapid product design and iteration.\nI describe this process in detail in “How To Write a Good PRD,” but there are two keys: 1) the idea is to create a high-fidelity prototype that mimics the eventual user experience – it’s just fine if the back-end processing and data is all fake; and 2) you need to validate this product design with real target users.\nIn this model, it is normal to create literally dozens of versions of the prototype – it will evolve daily, sometimes with minor refinements and sometimes with very significant changes. But the point is that with each iteration you are getting closer to identifying a winning product. This process typically takes between 3 weeks and 2 months, but at the end of the process, you have a) identified a product that you have validated with the target market; b) a very rich prototype that serves as a living spec for the engineering team to build from; and c) you now understand at a much greater degree what you’re getting into and what you’ll need to do to succeed.\nNow when you bring on an engineering team, they’ll start off with a tremendous advantage – a clear understanding of the product they need to build and a stable spec – and you will find that the team can produce a quality implementation much faster than they would otherwise.\nThis model of prototype-based product experimentation is increasingly becoming the norm in the manufacturing world, but for some reason this hasn’t taken off in software. I think we’re such an engineering-driven culture that we just naturally start there. But any startup has to realize that everything starts with the right product – so the first order of business is to figure out what that is before burning through $500K or more in seed funding.\nI believe this model applies beyond startups to much larger companies as well. The difference is that bigger companies are generally able to underwrite the several iterations it takes to get to a useful product, but startups often can’t. But there’s no reason for the inefficiencies that larger companies regularly endure.\nSo on your next startup or new product development effort, give this approach a try.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/startup-product-management/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925820395,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"TRANSFORMED - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nWe have some news to share.\nThose of you that read EMPOWERED might have noticed that there was another book in the SVPG series that has long been envisioned: TRANSFORMED.\nOriginally, my partner Lea was going to write this book, but after a year of trying to manage all her SVPG client work as well as a young family, she passed the project off to my partner Jon.  But after a year of trying to manage all his SVPG client work as well as a young family, he passed this project off to me.\nThe good news is that I do far fewer time-consuming company engagements than they do, my kids are no longer young, and unlike most people, I enjoy the writing.  Even though I’m now driving this project, Lea, Jon, Christian and Chris will all be making significant contributions to this book, and so they will each be co-authors.\nThe result is that I’m already well into this project, and feel confident saying that the new book will be out in early 2024, although this will largely consume my year.  But the purpose of this article is that I’d like to ask for your help, which I’ll explain more below.\nWhy TRANSFORMED?\nWe wrote INSPIRED in order to share the best practices and techniques used by the best product teams.\nThen we wrote EMPOWERED in order to share the best practices and techniques used by the best product leaders in order to provide their product teams the environment they need to thrive.\nWhat we learned is that there are some companies, mostly those that were created in the Internet era, that were born out of this new model of technology-powered product companies, and the way of working we describe is quite natural.\nHowever, for the vast majority of companies in the world, (aka “the rest”) the ways of working we describe are very foreign.  \nMost of these companies know they need to transform in order to compete in an era of rapidly changing enabling technology, but they have found that the degree of change necessary is much more disruptive than they expected, and anything but easy.\nAnd so for the past twenty years, my SVPG partners and I have been helping as many of these companies as we can through the necessary changes.\nIt’s no secret that the overwhelming majority of companies globally that have attempted to transform have failed.  And rarely for lack of funding.\nOne CEO described the experience of transforming as “changing from driving on the left side of the road to the right – but gradually.”\nYet some companies do manage to transform, and their customers, employees and their shareholders have benefited dramatically from their new abilities.\nThis book is being written for the many people out there that are trying to help their companies transform: CEO’s, heads of product and technology, managers trying to help their individual contributors, and those coaches that help companies learn new and better ways to create products.\nThe purpose of TRANSFORMED is to share what we have learned about how to successfully transform your company.\nWhat Are The Big Topics?\nThe premise for this book was published a few months ago as a series of articles where we define what we mean by truly transforming to the product model.\nWith that as the goal, the main topics for the book include:\nthe new core competencies that the product model depends on\nthe critical core product concepts that power the product model\nthe set of product first principles that you need to get right\ntools and techniques for adopting and managing the required changes\ncommon objections from each key company stakeholder, and how to address\ncommon problems when organizations try moving to this model, and how to handle\nI’ve been going deep on each of these big topics, and I keep finding myself thinking “this is the most important topic in the book.”  Obviously they can’t all be the most important, but it may say something about how substantial and important each of these big topics are.\nFirst Person Transformation Case Studies\nThe part of the book that I’m most excited about, and I think the highlight for those that were invited to the Coach the Coaches sessions in London and NYC, will be the three, first-person transformation case studies.\nLea, Christian and Jon each joined SVPG after leading major successful transformations of large pre-Internet companies.  It’s not a coincidence that they joined SVPG after that.  I was able to observe each of them navigate the many challenges, and succeed where so many others have failed.\nI’ve seen several transformation case studies out there, but most of them are failure case studies, and the few that I’ve seen that were considered successful are all “as told to.”\nMoreover, it’s important to us that unlike our other books, in this book we won’t be showcasing any of the leading edge tech companies.  We all know they had a big advantage growing up in the product model.  \nThis book is about helping companies that do not currently follow the product model to develop new muscles.  So every example will be from companies that needed to transform in order to consistently innovate.  And some of these examples of what these companies have been able to do with their new skills will amaze you.\nThe Role of Coaching\nHow do you lead your organization through major change if you haven’t already been there and done that yourself?\nOne of the big realizations for us is that a serious challenge for many – if not most – companies trying to transform is that their leaders have never experienced the product model before.\nOne way to address this is to try to recruit some experienced product leaders to join your leadership team.  And we do encourage that.  But even then, it’s very difficult for those new leaders to have the necessary bandwidth to coach and develop a large organization.\nHence the need for more product coaches to help these companies learn the new ways of working.\nIf you’ve been following along, you know that we have been spending an increasing amount of time and effort working to nurture and develop a global product coaching community.  This book also serves as the next step in that effort.\nWe’ll also be profiling a number of product coaches, so that companies trying to transform can get a better sense of what to look for in a product coach.\nHow Can You Help?\nAs long-time readers of these articles know, much of what we publish as articles is intended to potentially end up as chapters in a book.  That will be especially true over the next six months.\nIf these topics are important and relevant to you, then hopefully you’ll send us your thoughts and questions.  Especially useful is when something is confusing or unclear, or if an issue you see in your company is not addressed, and you think it should be.\nWe’ll also have some specific questions on particular topics as we publish them.\nIn the meantime, we hope you’re as interested in reading this book as we are in writing it.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/transformed/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925754019,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"TRANSFORMED Leadership Workshop - Silicon

Usually.

Action - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tKeeping in mind the principles of empowerment that team objectives are designed to encourage, we are ready to have the product teams get to work.  So let’s discuss the mechanics of assigning objectives to product teams.\nAssigning Objectives To Product Teams\nTo be very clear, and to address head on another one of the very common misconceptions about team objectives, it is the responsibility of the leaders to decide which problems should be worked on by which product teams.\nSo many companies think that the idea is to let the product teams come up with their own objectives, yet are somehow surprised when the organization complains of lack of direction, and little is accomplished.  Whenever I see this in a company, this priceless Monty Python clip immediately comes to mind.  And it’s important to point out that this is not the fault of the teams; it’s the clear fault of leadership.\nMore generally, the whole point of assigning objectives to product teams is to execute on a product strategy.  The product strategy is all about deciding which problems to work on.\nAssigning objectives to product teams is both a top-down and bottom-up process, and it often requires iteration.\nThese assignments are a function of the product strategy, and the team topology (aka team scoping); in other words, the strategy tells us which problems we need to solve, and the topology will imply which teams are best suited to tackle each problem.\nNow, we love it when teams volunteer to pursue an objective, and we try hard to accommodate that desire, but we also are clear with the teams that we can’t always accommodate because we have to ensure that in aggregate, the organization is covering as much of the overall organizational objectives as possible.\nSo even though a team may wish to pursue a specific objective, it is up to the leaders to decide this.\nDetermining Key Results\nOnce a team is asked to pursue an objective, the first thing they need to do is consider what the appropriate key results should be, and what they believe they can accomplish.  \nIf it’s the first time they have worked on this problem, then they may need some months to learn the space, and to start collecting some data to establish a baseline, and to get a sense of what the possibilities are.  If they’ve worked in this area before, they probably already have a reasonable sense.\nThe team will also need guidance from leadership on how ambitious or conservative they should be in pursuing solutions.  More on this topic next, but for now, let’s just say that it’s important that the leaders provide the team with some guidance on how aggressive they would like the team to be in pursuing solutions.\nBut suppose the team is asked to pursue two objectives, and the results they propose to achieve are considered by management as insufficient to achieve the necessary business results over the year.\nIn this case, the leaders might ask the team to instead pursue just a single objective rather than two, or they might ask another team to collaborate with them on one of the problems.\nWhat is most important is that if the leaders want the product team to feel ownership of the results, then the results must come from the team.\nAlignment\nOnce the leaders have worked with the product teams to decide which product teams will pursue which actions, they then need to ensure that the product teams and the broader organization are aligned.\nFor example, let’s say we’re working to bring to market a significant new product offering.\nWe need to ensure that any necessary platform team efforts are aligned to do the work necessary to support the experience product teams. \nSimilarly, we need to ensure the sales and marketing efforts are appropriately aligned.\nIf the sales and marketing teams were pursuing a different market, or not preparing for the new market, that would be an example of not being in alignment.\nKeep The Lights On Work\nIt’s important to keep in mind that the team objectives are not the only work that a product team is responsible for.  It may be the most important work, but there is always what we call “keep the lights on” or “business as usual” work involving fixing critical problems, responding to customer issues, providing assistance to other teams, technical debt work, and more.\nOver time, teams get a better understanding of what this ongoing cost is.  In some cases, this ongoing work can reach the point that it consumes the team, in which case the leaders will need to either not expect anything beyond this overhead work, or they will need to invest in reducing this overhead burden, or potentially grow the team.\nNext we’ll discuss one of the most important dimensions to a team objective, which is how ambitious the team should be in pursuing solutions.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-action/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925868140,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Team Objectives - Ambition - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tWe have now assigned one or more specific problems to solve to each product team, but we’re not quite done providing the necessary context. \nWhen leaders ask a team to work on solving a problem, it’s important to be clear with the team on the level of ambition they should strive for in their discovery work.  \nShould the team focus on low-risk but low-reward “sure things,” or should they strive for more substantial and dramatic improvements?\nOne useful way to think about team objectives is that the leaders are placing a series of bets.  Some are low-risk, some are high-risk, and some are in between.  \nThey’re making bets primarily on the people, but also on new enabling technologies, changing market conditions, and the strength of the insights behind the product strategy.\nAs you’ll see, if something is important enough, the leaders might choose to have several teams each attack a problem in their own way; some going for low-risk, quick-wins, and others maybe going for much more ambitious but higher-risk approaches.\nIt’s important not to confuse the level of ambition, with the level of effort or sense of urgency.  \nWork ethic and sense of urgency are more a function of the culture, and very likely also your company’s cash situation, and not what we are addressing here.\nTeams that are pursuing low-risk/low-reward solutions will test much different product ideas than ones pursuing high-risk/high-reward solutions.  The nature of the product discovery work will be different, and the techniques they use will likely be different.\nIt’s also important not to confuse the level of ambition with a high-integrity commitment (which we’ll discuss next).  In this case they are related, but a commitment is a special and critically important concept in its own right (which we’ll discuss next).\nThis is really all about risk management.  If you have a very difficult and critically important problem – such as a churn rate that is far too high to sustain a business – then experienced leaders will want to attack that problem from different angles and different levels of risk.  They may have a couple teams pursuing “low-lying fruit” but they’re worried that won’t be enough, so they also have a couple teams pursuing much more ambitious approaches to the problem.\nSome people like to refer to level of ambition as either a “roof shot” or a “moon shot.”\nA “roof shot” refers to a team being asked to be conservative, and pursue lower-risk, but also highly likely, tangible results.  Optimization work fits well into this type of work.\nOn the other hand, a “moon shot” is a term for when the team is asked to be very ambitious, such as going for a 10X improvement.  It is expected that this is high-risk, but we also believe that it’s not impossible, and the team is well-positioned to make a serious attempt.  Yes, it’s high-risk, but it’s also potentially high-reward.\nThe point of a moon shot is to encourage the team to think beyond the small and safe optimizations, and revisit how the problem is solved today in the hopes of breaking through.\nAnd still other companies prefer to attach a degree of confidence to the objective, such as 80% likely to achieve for a roof shot, versus 20% likely to achieve for a moon shot.\nThese techniques are useful for communicating the desired level of ambition to the teams.  But realize that in terms of managing a portfolio of risk, there can and should be any level of ambition in between.\nImagine a professional poker player in Las Vegas being told she could only place bets of $1 or $10,000.  That would seriously hinder her ability to work, because she would rather be able to place a range of bets in various amounts based on the circumstances.\nThe point is that the leaders are essentially managing a portfolio of risk and potential reward.  They may have certain teams being more ambitious than others, even for the same objective.\nWhatever the level of ambition associated with your key results, be sure to clearly communicate this across the organization – you especially don’t want anyone to assume that something is a very high confidence result when it’s not.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-ambition/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925863421,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Team Objectives - Collaboration - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tContinuing with our series on Team Objectives, there are several forms of collaboration that are essential, yet often confusing to product organizations as they optimize for team autonomy and empowerment.\nShared Objectives\nThe first and most basic form of collaboration is the concept of a shared objective.  For an important objective, it is not at all unusual for multiple teams to have the same objective.\nThis is especially common in the case of large company initiatives (which are essentially problems large enough that they require help from many or sometimes even all product teams).\nThe most straightforward example of this is when both an experience product team and a platform team have the same objective, because the platform team is expected to need to provide one or more new services to enable the experience product team.\nIn this case, normally the teams will collaborate to establish a simple form of contract with each other in the form of an API, and then both proceed to figure out their sides, and then they will again collaborate on testing and delivery.\nAnother form of shared objective is when multiple teams temporarily combine their talents to solve a particularly hard problem.  Especially on problems that benefit from a range of different skills brought to bear, bringing the teams together can often provide the knowledge and synergy required to quickly come up with an effective solution.\nIn certain situations, the teams will co-locate for a few days or a week in what is sometimes called a “swarm,” which is an intense, highly collaborative technique to dive deep together on either or both of discovery or delivery work, for a particularly challenging problem.\nCommon Objectives\nAnother form of collaboration is when multiple teams are asked to pursue the same problem, but in different ways.\nThe reason for this is really risk management.  If the problem is difficult, we know that it’s very hard to know which approach, if any, will produce the necessary results.  So we may ask multiple teams to pursue, and hope that at least one of those teams will be able to generate the necessary impact.  It would be even better of course if all of them made a significant impact, but we know that’s unlikely.\nA good example of this might be when one of the focus areas is subscriber churn, where too many of our customers are leaving the service.  There are of course many ways this problem can be addressed, and having multiple teams address this from multiple angles is often a good strategy.\nIn this case, the teams will need to communicate to ensure that there are no conflicts between the work, but normally each team is addressing based on the perspective and angle of their team, and what code and technology they own, so these approaches are usually largely independent and cumulative.\nOne of the questions that often comes up with common objectives is how to attribute progress to a specific team when multiple teams are making changes in parallel.  This is referred to as the product attribution problem, and the standard answer to that is the A/B test, which will isolate a specific team’s contribution (keep in mind that sometimes the work helps, sometimes it actually hurts, and sometimes it makes no impact).\nThe higher order point is that it is normal and often wise to have multiple teams pursuing the same objectives in one form or another.  \nCompanies that avoid shared or common objectives in the name of autonomy or communication, are often limiting their ability to solve the toughest and most important problems.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-collaboration/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925869315,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Team Objectives - Commitments - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tWhile most objectives are meant to be aspirational, where we aren’t sure which will succeed and to what degree, and we can vary the degree of ambition the team strives for, there are always certain cases where we need the team to make what is called a high-integrity commitment.\nHigh-Integrity Commitments\nFew people like what I’m about to say, but if you haven’t learned this yet about the commercial product world, it’s time you do:\nIn all businesses there are occasional situations where something important must be delivered by a specific deadline date.\nThe deadline might be a major industry trade show-driven date, or it might be a partner-driven date due to a contract, or a calendar-driven date due to tax days or the holiday period, or a marketing-driven date due to a purchased advertising campaign.\nRealize that one of the main reasons leaders gravitate towards the command and control model of management, especially with old-style roadmaps of features and projects delivered on dates, is precisely because of this need to know when important things are going to happen.\nSo a key condition to moving to empowered teams is that the teams are able to provide dates and deliverables when necessary, and further, not just the low-integrity dates of the roadmap era (because we really had very little understanding of what was being committed to), but dates the leaders can count on.\nIf you’re used to conventional-style Agile processes, you probably know that coming up with a high-confidence date is very difficult if not impossible.  However, if you’re used to the model of doing product discovery in parallel with product delivery, then you know that coming up with a high-confidence date is not hard, so long as the company is willing to wait until the necessary product discovery work has been done before the date is provided.\nNow, if a company has too many of these date-driven commitments, it is usually a sign of more serious issues, but I always try to explain to product teams that some amount of high-integrity commitments is necessary when trying to run a business.\nEven if you don’t have these external commitments, there will be cases where you depend on other product teams – the most common example is when you depend on a new capability from a platform team.\nDeliverables\nIn these cases, we need to know with very high-confidence if a team can deliver on this promise.\nIn the event your product team is asked to make a high-integrity commitment, you will need to investigate the commitment, which typically involves doing sufficient product discovery on the item that your product team (especially the product manager, product designer and tech lead) can determine whether the solution will be valuable, usable, feasible and viable. \nThis often involves creating a quick prototype, such as a feasibility prototype, to ensure the engineers understand the scope of the necessary work to produce the necessary deliverable.\nOnce the product team believes they understand the solution sufficiently, they can estimate with high-confidence how long it will take for them to deliver on this commitment (feasibility), and also whether that solution will work for the customer (value and usability) and work for your company (viability).\nIn the case of an experience team depending on a commitment from a platform team, where that platform team may need to provide an API or a new service that the experience team will build upon, the platform team can inherit from the experience team their objective and key results.\nMost importantly, for high-integrity commitments, the actual deliverable which is the commitment needs to be noted and tracked independently of the key results.\nTracking High-Integrity Commitments \nThese high-integrity commitments are given special treatment.  We do not talk in terms of how ambitious the team is to be. These are binary.  The team either delivers what they promised or not. And a team that makes a high-integrity commitment is absolutely expected to deliver, or if at the first sign of trouble, they need to raise the flag early and ask for help.\nFurther, we normally track these high-integrity commitments explicitly.  In some companies, the CTO must agree to each high-integrity commitment, because it is her reputation on the line.\nAs I’ve said many times in my writing, empowered product teams are predicated on trust, and high-integrity commitments are one of the important ways that product teams build trust with leadership, so when you are asked to come up with a high-integrity commitment date, it is essential that you and your team are sure you can and will deliver on this commitment.\nOne final note of warning, high-integrity commitments and deliverables should be the exception and not the rule.   Otherwise it is a slippery slope and pretty soon your objectives are nothing more than a list of deliverables and dates, which is little more than a reformatted roadmap.\nNext we’ll discuss the various ways we may need to collaborate on especially difficult and important problems.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-commitments/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925869670,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Team Objectives - Empowerment - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNOTE: There is so much widespread confusion out there on OKR’s, it’s a very difficult topic to discuss because everyone brings their own very different experiences and perspective to the conversation.  If your company is using OKR’s today and you believe they are truly helping you deliver consistent innovation, then no need to read further. However, if you have found that for whatever reason this technique has not delivered the promised value, then I’d encourage you to try to forget anything you may have read or heard about OKR’s, and consider the points in this series of articles with an open mind, and see if they make sense to you.\nNow that we know what actions we need each product team to pursue, we need to discuss how we assign this work in such a way as to empower the team.\nThe essential point of team objectives is to empower a team by a) giving them a problem to solve rather than a feature to build; and b) ensuring they have the necessary strategic context to understand the why, and to make good decisions.\nThe most important point to understand about team objectives is that first and foremost, they are intended to give the product team the space to come up with solutions to hard and important problems.\nThis is in stark contrast to a typical product roadmap which is providing the team with a prioritized list of features and projects to build.  If those features or projects do not solve the underlying problems, then we fail, even though we may have delivered what we were asked to build.\nAssigning Problems To Solve, Rather Than Features To Build\nSome people believe that the difference is not such a big deal.  If you think you need your team to build an app, then just tell them to build the app, rather than providing them the business and strategic context, and letting them figure out we need to build an app.\nBut one of the major lessons our industry has learned, is how work is assigned matters.  \nDavid Marquet, a long-time advocate for empowered teams and author of the recent book Leadership is Language, argues “even when you want to be a more collaborative leader, you can undermine your own efforts by defaulting to command-and-control language we’ve inherited from the industrial era.”\nThere are many reasons why this is preferred, but the most important are:\nThe best people to determine the most appropriate solution are those closest to the problem, with the necessary skills – the product team.\nWe want the team to take responsibility for achieving the desired outcome.\nIf we tell the team the feature we want them to build, then if that feature doesn’t provide the necessary results, we can’t hold the team accountable.\nIf we give the team the problem to solve, and the space to solve it in the best way they see fit, the product team will feel much more ownership of the problem.\nIf the first solution the team comes up with does not produce the desired outcome, they know they must continue to iterate until they do find a solution that does.\nSo Team Objectives are comprised of an objective (the problem that needs to be solved) and some measures of progress (the key results).  Let’s discuss each.\nObjectives\nThe specific objectives will of course be a function of the type of product and the responsibilities of the particular product team, but typical examples of good objectives are:\nReduce the frequency of parcels delivered to the wrong address.\nIncrease the percentage of shipments delivered with next day delivery.\nReduce the percentage of images flagged as inappropriate.\nReduce the subscriber churn rate.\nDemonstrate product/market fit for an existing product in a new market.\nDecrease the time it takes a job seeker to find a new job.\nReduce the operational costs of fulfillment.\nReduce the cost to acquire a new customer.\nIncrease the lifetime value of the customer.\nReduce the percentage of customers that require customer service assistance.\nReduce the average time spent handling a customer service call.\nIncrease the percentage of new customers that successfully create an account.\nReduce the time for a user to produce their first monthly report.\nReduce the time required to deploy a new or updated service to production.\nImprove the site availability.\nWhat’s most important about all of these examples is that they are problems to solve, and not features to build. \nSome are customer problems and some are business problems, but in each case, there are any number of potential solutions.  The point is that the product team is best suited to determine the most appropriate solution.\nNotice also the example objectives are all qualitative.  The quantitative dimension will be discussed in the key results.\nIt’s also important to acknowledge here that many of the most important objectives will require the product team to either collaborate with other product teams, or in many cases, to collaborate with different parts of the organization to achieve the goal.  That is not only ok, but very much intended, although in practice this clearly depends on having a product manager on the product team that has a deep understanding of the business.\nKey Results \nWhile the objective is the problem to solve, the key results tell us how we define success.\nAnd it’s essential that we define success by business results (aka outcome), and not simply activity or output.\nThe second most common reason that teams go wrong with OKR’s is that they end up listing activities or deliverables as their key results.  Hopefully this is clear to you at this point, but just in case it’s not, the reason this is so much of a problem is that it is very easy to ship a deliverable, yet not solve the underlying problem.  In which case, we’re back to the same old problem we have with product roadmaps.\nGenerally speaking, we want two key results for each objective.  The first key result is the primary measure. The second key result is a measure of quality, sometimes called a “backstop,” to ensure that the first key result is not inadvertently achieved by hurting something else.\nFor example, suppose we consider the objective of: \nReduce the frequency of parcels delivered to the wrong address.\nNow, the primary key result would likely be the actual percentage of incorrect deliveries.  But if we were to achieve that by burdening the ordering and fulfillment process, it’s possible to reduce the percentage, but also significantly reduce the absolute number of deliveries, which would not be a helpful solution.  So, potential key results could be measured by: \nReduce percentage of incorrect deliveries\nWhile ensuring that total deliveries continues to grow\nNotice that while these key results do imply specific KPI’s, we don’t yet have the expected values or timeframes, because those will need to come from the team. \nThe reason for that is that if we were to provide to the team explicit measures of success including time frame, they won’t feel that ownership over the commitment that we want in an empowered team.  So the actual quantitative values will come from the teams.\nIt’s also important to note that sometimes the most appropriate measure of success or KPI is not yet clear, especially in the case where it’s a problem we haven’t worked on before.  In this case, the team may need some time to better understand the dynamics and the most appropriate measures.  \nA related issue is to be sure the team is not “letting the tail wag the dog.”  What that means is that sometimes a team will be tempted to define their key results by something that is easy to measure, rather than what’s most meaningful to measure.\nSharing Strategic Context\nIf we are to give product teams the space to solve hard problems, we must also provide these teams with the context necessary to make good decisions.\nWe need to share the strategic context, especially the product strategy, with the product teams for four main reasons:\nFirst, it’s critical that the team has a deep understanding of the ultimate goal, and why this is an important problem to solve.\nSecond, we want teams to start thinking about how they each might be able to contribute to solving the key problems.\nThird, we want the teams to start thinking through the implications of the upcoming work.  Perhaps there are dependencies that are not immediately visible. Or technologies or skills that we will need to acquire.\nFourth, we love it when teams express a special interest in working on specific problems.  We can’t always accommodate every team working on the problems they request, but we are certainly motivated to try.\nWith these principles in mind, we’re now ready to assign objectives to specific product teams.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-empowerment/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925863371,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Team Objectives - Management - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tContinuing on our series on team objectives, once product teams have their team objectives for the quarter and are pursuing, active management will still be needed.\nMuch as the product strategy requires ongoing tracking and managing by the product leaders, the team objectives require ongoing tracking and managing by the product team.\nKeep The Lights On Work\nRemember that the team objectives are not the only work that a product team is responsible for.  We also have the “keep the lights on” or “business as usual” work we discussed earlier. We do need to keep an eye on this ongoing work if it spikes, the team won’t be able to make much progress on their team objectives.\nWeekly Tracking\nThe key is to make sure the product teams are actively managing the progress on the team objectives, otherwise it is all too possible that weeks and then months will fly by with little progress.\nAt a minimum, the product teams stay on top of progress by discussing at weekly check-ins where they are, what is upcoming, and where they might need help.  These weekly OKR check-ins are the key mechanism that teams use to track and manage their own progress. \nResolving Conflicts\nOccasionally the teams will raise an issue that requires the leaders to coordinate to resolve conflicts or issues.  There are different schools of thought on the meetings that leaders can use to manage these issues, but our focus is for issues to be actively managed, decisions made promptly, and large group meetings minimized.\nStaying On Track\nHowever, there’s two caveats here.  First, it’s critical that each member of the product team is getting the ongoing coaching they need to develop.  And some of that coaching will pertain to the OKR related issues they face.  \nSecond, the product manager specifically needs to be communicating with her manager about any important issues so that the manager can have the chance to provide assistance where possible.\nIf the team determines they need the assistance of management, then the sooner this need is raised the better chance management has of helping in a timely and effective manner. \nIt’s also an important obligation to alert management as early as possible in the event that there is a question as to the team’s ability to deliver on a high-integrity commitment.\nSimilarly, if there is a dependency, such as on another product team, this dependency will need to be managed and tracked carefully.  If they are a dependency for another team, then they will need to keep this in mind and ensure this work is completed in time for the team that is depending on them.\nHelping Our Colleagues\nWhile so much of empowered product teams is about optimizing for the product teams, it’s also important to recognize that we often will need to help our colleagues on other product teams out, and we very likely have situations where we will depend on them helping us out as well.\nThe best product teams know that when it comes to tech companies, we either all succeed or none of us succeed.  And it’s not unusual to find yourself in the situation where you believe you must do something that’s not in the best interest of your product team, but you see that it is in the best interest of the customer and of the broader organization.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-management/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925870522,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Team Objectives - Overview - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tAfter many years of being a very vocal advocate for the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) technique, in the majority of companies I meet, I have stopped recommending the practice.\nThat’s because, in so many companies, even though conceptually the technique is simple and sound, it ends up proving a waste of time and effort, and yields little if any results.\nHow can something so conceptually simple have such a hard time being applied in practice?\nThe short answer is that most companies are not set up to effectively apply this technique.\nAs I see it, there are three fundamental reasons for this: \nFeature Teams vs. Product Teams \nIf the company is still using feature teams, as most unfortunately are, then the OKR technique is going to be a cultural mismatch, and almost certainly prove a waste of time and effort.\nThe OKR technique came from companies that had empowered product teams in their DNA.  OKR’s are first and foremost an empowerment technique. \nThe main idea is to give product teams real problems to solve, and then to give the teams the space to solve them.\nYet the telltale sign of mismatch out there is that companies think they can “check the empowerment box” by giving the team objectives, yet still continue to tell them the solutions they are supposed to deliver – nearly always in the form of a roadmap of features and projects with expected release dates. \nManager’s Objectives vs. Product Team Objectives \nThe second issue is that the purpose of a cross-functional, empowered product team is to work together to solve hard problems.\nYet, in so many companies, each manager – the manager of engineers, the manager of designers and the manager of product managers – creates their own organizational objectives, which are then cascaded down to their employees.\nWhile this may sound reasonable, and is not necessarily a problem for other parts of the company, in practice this means that these employees – when working with their cross-functional colleagues in a product team – are all working on their own objectives, rather than working collaboratively on the team objectives.\nTo make matters even worse, in many companies, there’s an additional level of complexity and dilution because they also try to implement individual objectives, so not only does the engineer inherit the objectives from her manager, but she also has to work on her own personal objectives. \nThe Role of Leadership\nAnd finally, and really the root of the problem, is that in the vast majority of companies I see that are struggling to get any value out of OKR’s, the role of leadership is largely missing in action.\nThey literally think that the idea is to let teams identify a set of objectives, and then let them pursue those objectives, and we’ll see where we are at the end of the quarter.\nThey think that empowered product teams, and this technique especially, is about less management.  But it’s actually about better management.\nIt is really any wonder why so many companies get so little value from this technique?\nIt’s no secret that most of the leading tech product companies use the OKR technique, or one of the variants.  And it’s also no secret how much success these companies have had.\nYet people are confusing correlation with causation.\nThose successful companies aren’t successful because they use OKR’s.  They use OKR’s because it is designed to leverage the empowered product team model.  \nAnd as I have tried to make clear with years of articles and talks, the empowered product team model is a fundamentally different approach to building and running a tech-product organization.\nYou can’t take your old organization based on feature teams, roadmaps and passive managers, then overlay a technique from a radically different culture, and expect that will work or change anything.\nSo in terms of actually getting the benefits of OKR’s, there are three critical prerequisites:\nMove from the feature team model to the empowered product team model\nStop doing manager objectives and individual objectives, and focus on team objectives\nLeaders need to step up and do their part to turn product strategy into action\nThe majority of my writing has been about the first topic.\nFor the second item, this is mainly education.\nIt is the third item that needs much more discussion, so in the upcoming series of articles on team objectives, we’ll discuss the role of leadership in effective team objectives.\nFirst, we’ll discuss specifically how we empower teams through team objectives.\nThen, we’ll discuss how we execute on our product strategy through action.\nNext, we’ll discuss how leaders manage a portfolio of risk by sharing with teams how ambitious they would like them to be as they pursue the problems they’ve been asked to solve.\nIt’s critical to note that sometimes it’s not about the level of ambition, but rather, we need to occasionally make what’s called a high-integrity commitment, and we need to discuss how these are made and managed.\nOne of the common misconceptions about team objectives is that only a single product team should work on a specific problem.  On the contrary, much of our best work requires collaboration between teams, and there are several important forms of collaboration we’ll discuss.\nAs with any difficult technology-based endeavor, we need to actively manage this work, always being mindful to manage by coaching and servant leadership, and not to regress to command and control style management, and lose the benefits of empowerment.\nAlong with empowerment comes accountability, and we need to discuss what this means in practice.\nFinally, we’ll summarize with the most important points to getting the real value out of team objectives.\nSpecial thanks for Christina Wodtke and Felipe Castro for reviewing a draft of this

Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Teams\n\tMarch 4, 2020\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tWe need some way to assign and manage work to product teams, and we want to do this in a way that is empowering and executes on our product strategy.  This is the purpose of Team Objectives. Assuming you have embraced the empowered product team model, and you have capable leaders, it is fairly straightforward.  \nHere are the most important keys to effective team objectives:\n The most important thing is to empower teams by assigning them problems to solve, and then give the teams the space to solve them.  In order to make good decisions, they will also need you to share the strategic context, including the strategic focus and the strategic insights.\n We love it when product teams volunteer to work on specific objectives, and we try to accommodate this when possible to leverage their motivation and enthusiasm for the problem, but we can’t always do so because we need to make sure we cover everything we need to.\n Selecting the objectives to be worked on, and ultimately deciding which team or teams works on each objective, is the explicit responsibility of product leadership.  However, and this is critically important for empowerment, the key results need to come from the team.\n It’s normal that there’s a back and forth – not that the leaders are doubting or questioning what the teams propose as their key results, but rather judging which investments are worth the effort and associated risk.  For example, suppose a team believes that with their other objectives, they can only make a very minimal improvement to a specific important KPI. The leaders might consider having that team focus exclusively on the one objective, or decide to ask a different team to pursue or help.\n There is nothing wrong with assigning the same objective to multiple teams, each approaching the problem in its own way.  In fact, for difficult product problems, this is often a very effective technique. On hard problems, we expect that not all teams will make the same level of progress, and we can’t anticipate in advance what the teams will learn when they each get deep into their product discovery work.\n Similarly, there is nothing wrong with asking multiple teams to collaborate on the same objective.  Especially when the problem requires different sets of skills, it’s not unusual to ask multiple teams to work together.  A common situation is asking a platform team and an experience team to collaborate on a difficult problem.\n In order for product teams to come up with key results, it’s essential that they understand the level of ambition you are looking for from them.  We need to be clear with teams when we want them to be very ambitious (aka “moon shot”); when we want them to be conservative (aka “roof shot”); and when we need them to make an actual high-integrity commitment.\n Product teams can only be accountable to the results if they are empowered to figure out a solution that works; and if they are the ones to come up with the key results.\n The product leaders have to realize that while team objectives are critically important, they are not the only things that the product team is working on.  Every team has some level of ongoing “business as usual” or “keep the lights on” activities. Fixing critical bugs, handling customer situations, etc. \n Normally these team objectives are created or updated every quarter.  That gives teams enough time to make real progress, yet not too much time that the business can’t adjust to changes.  There may be occasional situations where team objectives need to change during the quarter, but these should be the exception rather than the rule.\nTo keep all this in perspective, remember that the essence of this is simply having a knowledgeable leader sit down with the product team, and explain the strategic context, and then explain the problem you need the team to solve, and how success is measured.  \nWhether you use a formal technique like OKR’s to do this is much less important; the key is to have this conversation, and for the leaders to give the product teams the space to solve the problems in the best way they see fit.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Teams\n\tNovember 7, 2022\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tThe Foundation of Product\n\t\n\tRecently I wrote an article about some product ops anti-patterns, but several people pointed out to me that I had...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Teams\n\tApril 28, 2020\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tSpotify vs. Fitbit\n\t\n\tI thought I was done with the series of articles on the importance of empowered engineers, but then an article...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Teams\n\tApril 13, 2020\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tDiscovery When Working Remotely\n\t\n\tNormally the question I focus on in my work and in my writing is “How can we leverage the best...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/team-objectives-summary/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925837871,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Technology, Products and Marketing - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSome people believe that business is all about marketing and building brand – establishing a great brand in the mind of consumers. Many of these same people also believe that one of the biggest weaknesses of Silicon Valley-style companies is that we just don’t get marketing in general and brand development in particular.\nRemember the old line about marketing at HP? “If HP were selling Sushi, it would market it as cold, dead fish.” That joke of course referred to the old HP – Carly certainly changed that. HP became much better at marketing, but along the way they seemed to have lost much of what built their great brand in the first place. I would argue that HP had a much stronger brand when they were known for great products but terrible marketing than after they had transformed to great marketing but with few innovative products.\nI do think it is true, however, that many valley companies are overly obsessed about technology. I see this as a big problem, and I run into it all the time. It’s not about technology just like it’s not about the marketing. Too many companies seem to forget that it’s really all about the products – the customer experience, the value the product provides, and most importantly, whether you have loyal, enthusiastic customers.\nTechnology is great when it enables a great product. Marketing is great when you have a great product and you want to share it with the world. But I’ve found that if you have a bad product, you might be able to buy some time with clever and aggressive marketing, but eventually people figure out it’s still a bad product. On the other hand, if you have a great product, especially in our Internet age, then the vast majority of the branding and marketing will be done by your customers. This of course is the best kind of marketing, and a terrific way to build brand.\nMy favorite examples are eBay and Google. These companies invested nearly nothing in outbound marketing or brand development, yet both developed massive numbers of loyal, enthusiastic customers and ended up establishing phenomenal brands. But eBay and Google didn’t happen by accident either. Both products were guided by clear and compelling principles that are reflected throughout the product and user experience. I’m a big believer in establishing those product principles up front and ensuring that everything you do supports those principles.\nAll that said, I do think there is much to be learned from companies that are excellent at brand development and marketing. When you’ve built a great product and you have a growing number of happy customers, and you see your brand developing, it’s important to protect that brand, to make sure that you constantly nurture your emerging fan base and not give them reason to turn on you, and ensure that everything you do supports the positive brand attributes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tTransformed FAQ\n\t\n\tThis page is here to hold questions and answers that come up once the TRANSFORMED book is published and we...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tAlternatives To Product Managers\n\t\n\tI doubt anyone is surprised to learn that many people have been asking me about Brian Chesky’s recent comments.

In that talk, I discussed two different product team archetypes, team red and team blue.\nTeam Red has a certified Agile Coach, Scrum Master, and Product Owner, and they diligently follow all Agile ceremonies.  Yet the team is not empowered in any meaningful sense (they are a pure feature team), and they release once a month at best, usually quarterly.\nTeam Blue thinks Agile as it’s practiced in so much of the industry is ridiculous.  There are no Agile coaches, no Scrum Masters, and their product managers scoff at the idea of a Product Owner.  Yet, they are truly empowered, given problems to solve, and focused on outcomes, and they have been doing CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) for literally years.\nSo which team is actually Agile in any meaningful sense?\nSo if Team Blue is actually Agile, yet they don’t have any Agile coaches and never have, how did they become this way?\nThe answer is that this is what competent managers do at good product companies.\nThe engineering managers (along with the more senior engineers) have a responsibility to coach and develop their engineers to learn difficult skills such as getting to the point where the team can ship frequent, small, reliable, uncoupled releases.\nSimilarly, the managers of product management and product design have a responsibility to coach and develop their product managers and product designers to work with engineering to consistently and responsibly discover solutions to the problems they’ve been asked to solve. \nIf you’ve never done the work to get production software to the point where you can reliably release on demand, or get your product discovery skills to the point where you can quickly address the product risks and discover effective solutions, then you may think this is easy.  But it’s not.\nIf whomever is coaching the product team doesn’t have the actual hands-on experience, it will be very difficult for them to truly help the team.\nIf you have someone with the title Agile Coach that doesn’t actually have either of these skill sets, and all they can really coach the team on is following a particular process, then this is what we mean by process people, and for a serious product company, this just isn’t very helpful.\nI was happy to see that the company laying off all these Agile people was helping them find other roles in their company.  I’ve already heard from some of them myself.  My advice to those that asked was to change their focus from the process, to the specific product discovery and/or product delivery skills that they have the relevant knowledge to help people with.  For some of them, there’s a terrific career opportunity in true product coaching.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-alternative-to-agile-coaches/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925956241,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Alternative to Roadmaps - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI have always loved the General George Patton quote: “Don’t tell people what to do; tell them what you need accomplished, and you’ll be amazed at the results.”\nUnfortunately, typical roadmaps do just what the General warned against – they tell the team what to do.  Usually that’s in the form of a prioritized list of features or projects that someone believes will actually solve some problem (even if that problem is often not explicitly stated or understood).\nFor example, if your roadmap has “integrate PayPal as an additional payment method” on it, is that because you believe that there is a market of people that can’t pay with your other payment methods, or because there’s international payment issues, or is it about lowering payment fees, or maybe it’s there because someone believes it’s a competitive disadvantage not to have it.\nIn several articles I have highlighted the reasons I see typical product roadmaps as the source of so much waste in product teams.  The Product Fail article covers this at a high level, and the concept is elaborated on in The Inconvenient Truth About Product .\nWhile there is increased recognition of the problems with roadmaps, many people have asked me to say more about the alternative.\nIn this article, I’d like to try to tackle this.  It is a big topic, and touches on issues beyond roadmaps such as product culture, empowerment and autonomy, and it usually takes me more than an hour to explain in person, but hopefully I can get those that are interested pointed in the right direction.\nBefore we jump into the alternative, we need to acknowledge that roadmaps have existed for so long because they serve two purposes, and these needs don’t go away.\nThe first purpose is because the management of the company wants to make sure that the teams are working on the highest business value items first.\nThe second purpose is because since they’re trying to run a business, there are cases where they actually need to make date-based commitments, and the roadmap is where they see and track those commitments.\nSo in order to be accepted in most companies, any alternative approach to roadmaps must address these needs at least as well as they are addressed today.\nRoadmaps derive from the old centralized command-and-control model.  A bunch of stakeholders meet, usually quarterly, in a room to come up with the priorities and the projects for the teams for the next quarter.\nIn contrast, in the product team model, the teams are supposed to be equipped and empowered to figure out the best ways to solve the particular business problems assigned to them.\nBut for this to happen, it’s not enough to have strong people.  The teams need to have the necessary context.  They need to have a deep understanding of where the company is heading, and they need to know how their particular team is supposed to contribute to the larger purpose.\nTo bring this back to General Patton, some of you might already know that this concept of an autonomous team is at the core of the way military forces operate.  A team is typically referred to as a “squad,” which is intentionally small and largely autonomous, working under the common intent, but free to solve problems as they best see fit.\nThe common intent is the context we have been talking about.  “Intent is a concise formulation of the overall goals and purpose…A clear intent initiates a force’s purposeful activity. It represents what the commander wants to achieve and why; and binds the force together;  It is normally expressed using effects, objectives and desired outcomes….The best intents are clear to subordinates with minimal amplifying detail.”\nFor technology companies, there are several ways to provide this context or intent, but what I advocate is two distinct components:\nThe Product Vision: this describes the holistic view of what the organization as a whole is trying to accomplish.\nThe Business Objectives: this describes the specific, prioritized business objectives for each product team.\nThere are several systems and methodologies for managing these business objectives, but my current favorite is the OKR system (Objectives and Key Results).  The idea is simple enough: tell the team what you need them to accomplish, and how the results will be measured, and let the team figure out the best way to solve the problems.\nNote that you might recognize these same parameters from the opportunity assessments/canvas.\nAs an example, suppose your product currently requires 30 days for a new customer to on-board.  But in order to scale effectively, this needs to be reduced down to 3 hours or less.  That’s a good example of an objective for one or more product teams: “dramatically reduce the time it takes for a new customer to go live.”  And one of the key results would be “average on-boarding time less than 3 hours.”\nWhile the concept of team objectives might sound straightforward, there are many ways to institutionalize this across product teams and organizations, and it can take a few quarters before the organization reaps the benefits.\nThere are actually quite a few lessons learned about both good product vision, and especially regarding good application of the OKR system, and I’ll make that a focus for the next several articles.  In the meantime, start with Christina Wodtke’s materials.\nSo this context is critical – the product vision and the team objectives.\nEarlier I said we needed to acknowledge the two drivers for old-style roadmaps.  The first was the desire to work on the highest business value items first.  Hopefully it is clear that this need is addressed by management providing the specific objectives for the organization and their prioritization.  The difference is that they are now prioritizing the importance of business results, rather than perceived value of features.\nThe second driver was the need for commitments.  We address this with the concept of high-integrity commitments. We do this for those situations where we need to actually commit to a date or a specific deliverable.\nThere are several benefits to this way of working:\nFirst, the teams are more motivated when they are free to solve the problem the best way they see fit.  It’s the missionary vs. mercenary thing again.\nSecond, the team is not off the hook just by delivering a requested feature or project; the feature must actually work (as measured by the key results) otherwise the team needs to try a different approach to the solution.\nThird, no matter where the idea for the solution comes from, very often the initial approach doesn’t actually work out, and rather than pretending this is not the case, this model embraces that likelihood.\nIt is all about outcome rather than output.\nI often encourage teams to look back over the past year and grade themselves on the success rate of their roadmap in terms of how many of the items actually met the business objectives.   If you do this, and if you’re not proud of what you find, then I’m hoping you’ll consider this alternative.  Ensure your product organization has a compelling product vision.  Ensure that each product team has a clearly defined, prioritized set of business objectives.  Make sure any commitments that must be made are high-integrity commitments.\nNow empower the product teams to solve the business problems the best way they see fit, and see how many of your teams surprise you with their results.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-alternative-to-roadmaps/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925894158,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The CSPO Pathology - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tFair warning that this and the next article will be a tough read.  It was a tough one to write, and I expect for many of you, it will be a tough one to read.  But in my view, we as an industry are suffering from a pandemic, but unlike COVID, there is no vaccine for this one.\nI spend my time working on closing the gap between how the best product organizations work, and the rest.\nYet it is no secret that the majority of product teams and product organizations in the world (“the rest”) are not strong.  The majority are not empowered, the majority of talent is underutilized, and the majority have product managers that are effectively little more than overpaid backlog administrators or project managers.\nI’ve written pretty extensively about the various forms of weak product teams and weak product managers – especially in product vs. feature teams, product vs. project teams and product vs. delivery teams.\nBut while these articles may describe the problematic behaviors, they don’t really tackle the more fundamental question of why?\nWhat I want to address specifically is why our industry has such a high proportion of weak product managers and product leaders. \nBy “weak” I mean people that either do not understand how to do their job, or are for whatever reason not capable of doing their job.\nWhile there are doubtless many reasons, as I see it, there are two very clear and distinct pathologies for these weak product managers and product leaders.\nIn this article I’ll discuss the first, and in the next article, I’ll tackle the second.\nThe CSPO Pathology\nThe fastest growing pathology I see, especially outside the US, is people confusing a product owner (the role on an Agile delivery team) with a product manager (one of the three critical competencies on a true product team).\nMy understanding is that there are well over 100,000 people that have become Certified Scrum Product Owners (CSPO).  Nothing wrong with that.  In fact, I’ve encouraged countless product managers to get this training.  \nBut my experience empirically is that for the vast majority of these people, the CSPO course has been their only formal training in preparation for their job as product manager.\nWhat’s more, the person that trained them how to be a product owner is almost never a proven strong product manager with experience from a strong product company.\nRather, they are usually some form of an “Agile Coach” that offers various certifications in several Agile delivery processes.\nThese people are confusing the rituals of a delivery process, with the skills and responsibilities of a major job on a product team.\nIt is just as ridiculous as saying you can train some random people in Scrum, and expect they are now ready to serve as skilled software engineers.  Or expect they are now skilled product designers.\nOf course, if these would-be coaches pretended that their training could prepare a designer or engineer, nobody would be fooled for a minute.  But because the product role is so poorly understood, and because a focus on process is such a tempting proxy, for many people and for many companies, they have literally come to believe that this is what product management is supposed to be.\nAnd it’s getting worse.  Some of these people that have never actually done the job, or even seen it done well, have gone on to write books and articles on product ownership and product leadership, run product conferences, and even start their own product schools and “product-management certification programs.”\nNow this would just be an irritating but relatively minor issue if the managers of the product managers could effectively coach and develop their people, as they are supposed to be doing.\nBut the problem in many companies is that so many of these managers have never done the job themselves, or even seen it done well.  So, they are forced to depend more on the training than they would otherwise.\nOf course, there are exceptions.  For example, I have long encouraged people to get their CSPO training from Jeff Patton because I know he knows the difference.  And I’ve met a few others that know what they’re doing too.  But most don’t, at least if you are going by my opinion of who knows what.\nOver the past several years I have gradually but consistently been turning up the volume on this problem, but there is such an entrenched industry at this point that there seems to be real resistance to acknowledging the seriousness and pervasiveness of this problem.\nBut the fix to this is not that hard.  Sending product managers to a CSPO course is fine, but it is not in any way a substitute for training as a product manager.\nSo how to train your product managers to be able to do their job?\nOur first choice is always for the manager to coach and develop her product managers herself.  But this assumes she has been an experienced and strong product manager herself.  If not, then she can work with a strong and proven product or discovery coach.  Or, a strong senior or principal product manager can help coach.\nFailing that, there are good options where you can send your product managers for actual product management training.  Just be sure you do your research, and make sure the specific instructor is herself a proven product manager, or ideally proven product leader, with real experience from a strong product company.\nUnfortunately, the CSPO pathology continues to spread, and continues to spawn new variants, some of which are even more deadly to innovation (e.g. SAFe).\nSummary\nTo be clear, I’m not arguing that a CSPO certification is bad.  I frequently recommend product managers take that simple course to learn their responsibilities as part of an Agile team.  \nAnd I’m certainly not arguing that Agile is bad, as I’ve been an advocate for Agile methods for delivery for nearly 20 years (although hopefully everyone reading this knows to steer clear of the fake agile nonsense out there).\nMy wish is that shining a light on this issue will cause leaders to reconsider the influences on your product people, and whether they are truly meeting your needs.  I’m hoping you’ll decide you would rather join the ranks of the best companies.\nI’d like to thank Chris Jones, Jeff Patton and Marcus Castenfors for their review of drafts of this article.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-cspo-pathology/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925828522,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Coaching Series - Silicon Valley Product

Foundation of Product - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRecently I wrote an article about some product ops anti-patterns, but several people pointed out to me that I had buried the lede in that article, and that the most important part of that article applied far beyond the relatively minor topic of product ops.\nSo in this article, I’d like to focus on this more fundamental topic, which gets to the very nature of product, and the foundation of what it means to be a strong product team.\nRecall that an empowered product team exists to solve important problems for our customers or our company, in ways that our users and customers love, with enabling technology that is just now possible, and in ways that work for our business.\nNote that this is a very different purpose than a feature team or a delivery team, so this article is specific to empowered product teams.\nIn order for the product team to come up with effective solutions, there are four constituencies that you will need unencumbered access to, in order to have any real hope of success:\nDirect Access To Users and Customers\nThis really should be obvious, but without direct, unencumbered access to actual users and customers, the product team has little hope of any kind of success in solving for value and usability.  \nThe users and customers provide not only inspiration for unaddressed problems but also the means to rapidly test our proposed solutions.  A little less obvious is the need for direct access to the data about these users and customers, such as how our users engage with our product, and the feedback these people provide on their experience using our product.\nIt should be intuitively clear why the product manager and product designer need direct access to users and customers, but less obvious is the importance of providing your engineers with direct access to the users.  \nYou don’t need all of your engineers to tag along on every customer or user interaction, but “the magic happens” when an engineer sees a user struggling with their product, so the more you can encourage and facilitate this, the better.\nBut the key here is not to let anyone try to prevent you from direct access to customers – not a sales or marketing person, not a customer success person, not a user researcher, not an Agile Coach, not a customer’s vendor manager, no one. \nDirect Access to Product Data\nSimilarly, the product manager needs direct access to the product data in order to make good decisions based on that data.\nThere are usually several data sources that contain different types of data—such as how your users are interacting with your product, how your customers purchase your products, and how your customers’ behaviors are changing over time.\nThe product team may have access to data analysts and data scientists to help explain complex data patterns, but the decisions based on this data are the responsibility of the product manager, so that person needs this direct data access.\nIn some companies, there are people that want to restrict access to this data, and it is important that your customer’s privacy and security be maintained.\nYou can create systems that enforce the appropriate types of governance, access, anonymization, and aggregation that may be required, but still give teams direct access to the essential data.\nAs with direct access to customers, direct access to data is fundamental to the product model. Without direct access to the data, the product manager is flying blind.\nDirect Access to Business Stakeholders\nSolving for viability is about solving for the various business constraints – marketing, sales, services, finance, legal, compliance, manufacturing, subject matter experts, and more – and it’s essential that at least the product manager has direct access to the leaders across your business that are responsible for these constraints.  \nThe product manager must establish relationships with these people, where the product manager has put in real time and effort to learn the concerns and needs of the various stakeholders, and the stakeholder genuinely believes that the product manager understands the relevant constraints, and will ensure they are considered and addressed in any proposed solution.  And for anything in that gray area where the product manager isn’t sure if something is viable or not, the product manager will discuss with the stakeholder before building anything.\nThis trust between the product team and the stakeholders is critical to the healthy collaboration that’s needed to find effective solutions that solve for both the customer and the business.  Which is also why product teams need to understand when and how to make occasional high-integrity commitments.\nDirect Access to Engineers\nFinally, we need to ensure that the product manager and product designer have daily, ongoing access to the engineers.  To many of you, this is the most obvious statement in the world.\nBut to others, such as those working in environments where the engineers are outsourced; or where the engineers are located in timezones where the interaction is difficult, or where the belief is that engineers need to be sheltered so they aren’t interrupted while they code; or where the product team is split up such that the product manager interacts with customers and stakeholders, and some other person, like a product owner or project manager, interacts with the engineers, then this is too often not the case.\nRealize that the engineers are working daily with the enabling technology, so they are in the ideal position to understand what’s “just now possible.” But realize this only happens in a way that is actionable when the engineers are interacting with the product manager and product designer every day.\nThe Inspiration for Innovation\nWhat all this means is that you need to protect the product team’s direct access to these four constituencies, and fight any attempt to place a well-meaning person, or cumbersome process, between the product team and these people.\nIt is in fact the direct, ongoing access to these four constituencies that enables the product team to discover innovative solutions, and to make good decisions.\nI find myself increasingly emphasizing the importance of “picking your battles.”  \nIf I could only pick one single thing to convince you of, in order to dramatically increase your odds of success, it would be this.  So I truly hope you’ll seriously consider this.\nIn my opinion, if you’re a product team and you are prevented from accessing any of these four constituencies, then you are very likely going to fail.  So correcting this is a battle worth fighting.  If your company doesn’t understand why this is foundational, and you’ve exhausted all efforts to explain the importance, yet you still wish to practice the craft of product in a strong product company, while I don’t like to say this, the truth is you may need to start considering companies where you’ll have a better chance of success.  It’s that important.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-foundation-of-product/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925816429,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Four Big Risks - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Discovery\n\tDecember 4, 2017\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tIn the first edition of my book, INSPIRED, I discussed how successful products are valuable, usable and feasible, where I defined “valuable” as both valuable to customers and valuable to your business. \nWhile it’s easy to remember these three attributes, over the years I’ve come to believe that it was obscuring some pretty serious risks and challenges, and making it too easy for product managers to focus on customer value and overlook business value. \nThe business value (viability) risks can be substantial and I find that these are too often under-appreciated and under-estimated (or simply avoided) by the product manager.\nSo in my new edition, I now explicitly call out the four types of risk:\nvalue risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it)\nusability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)\nfeasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have)\nbusiness viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)\nBusiness viability risk includes whether the product fits with the go-to-market or sales channel;

Cagan \nHewlett-Packard recently entered the artificial intelligence (Al) arena with the announcement of its first symbolic programming product, the Hewlett-Packard Development Environment for Common Lisp. The technology underlying HP’s initial product entry is the result of more than five years of research and development on what has evolved into the Hewlett-Packard AI Workstation. This article provides an overview of the AI Workstation technology.\nThe Hewlett-Packard AI Workstation represents the aggregate of the major symbolic programming software development efforts at Hewlett-Packard. (Previously, this research effort was internally referred to as the Prism program.)\nThe term AI Workstation refers to the company-wide internal research and development program in Al, rather than to a particular product. In addition to the many HP divisions whose efforts have contributed key system components, many important concepts are based on research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of California at Berkeley, and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The University of Utah, in particular, has contributed significantly.\nCurrently, HP’s AI Workstation is actively used by well over two hundred people at various HP divisions, as well as by students and professors at major research universities across the United States. HP recently announced a $50 million grant of hardware and software which will provide Hewlett-Packard AI Workstations to selected major computer science universities.\nThe AI Workstation technology is both portable and scalable, and can run on a variety of processors and operating systems, including the new HP 9000 Series 300 workstation family under the HP-UX operating system. \nThe first and primary product that is an offspring of the AI Workstation technology is the Hewlett-Packard Development Environment for Common Lisp, announced at the 1985 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Much of the technology described in this article is experimental and the reader should not assume the software discussed here can be purchased. Those components that are part of the Hewlett-Packard Development Environment for Common Lisp or other products will be noted.\nThere has been a great deal written in the press recently regarding symbolic programming technology and AI.  The transition from numeric programming to symbolic programming is analogous to the “algebraization” of mathematics that occurred a century ago. The axiomatic, abstract algebraic viewpoint that was needed to simplify and clarify so many puzzles then, is likened to the need for symbolic programming techniques to help solve today’s difficult computational problems.\nAI applications such as natural language understanding, theorem proving, and artificial vision all rely on symbolic programming techniques for their flexibility and power in manipulating symbols, manipulating relationships between symbols, and representing large and complex data structures. The AI Workstation is a software system designed to solve problems using symbolic programming techniques. This article explores the AI Workstation by describing it from four perspectives: the market, the technology, the environment, and the applications.\nTHE MARKET\nThere are many opinions concerning the future direction of the software market, but most agree that software is steadily becoming more complicated, powerful, and intelligent. Hewlett-Packard’s AI Workstation provides the technology for developing and executing intelligent and sophisticated applications.\nAt Hewlett-Packard, Al techniques are viewed as an enabling technology. The AI Workstation provides tools and facilities that enable the programmer to create applications that were previously considered infeasible. These applications include expert systems, artificial vision, natural language interfaces, robotics, and voice recognition systems. Development and execution of these Al applications often require capabilities not available or feasible in conventional computer systems. For example, consider an expert tax advisor application. Such a system would need to embody the relevant knowledge and reasoning strategies of human tax advisors. AI-based techniques provide the necessary mechanisms for this knowledge representation and reasoning.\nThe AI Workstation’s use need not be restricted to problems requiring the direct employment of Al technology, however. It has also been designed to foster improvements in the conventional software development market. For example, a typical tax accounting application may not need Al techniques for its implementation, yet can be implemented and maintained more productively by employing AI-based software development tools, such as tools that intelligently help locate and diagnose errors in the program code. The AI Workstation is used by the software developer to develop applications, and by end users to run AI-based applications. One of the AI Workstation’s primary contributions to the AI market is that it provides both a development environment and an execution environment for AI applications, and it provides both on low-cost, conventional hardware such as the HP 9000 Series 300.\nThe software developer sees the AI Workstation as an environment tailored for the rapid development of software systems. The languages provided are geared for high productivity. The environment allows multiple programs, written in multiple languages, to be created, tested, and documented concurrently. Interpreters and compilers allow systems to be developed incrementally and interactively. The software developer can use the AI Workstation for the development of knowledge-based systems, or simply as a more productive means of generating conventional software written in conventional languages. In general, then, two reasons motivate the use of the AI Workstation as a software development machine. Either the AI Workstation technology is necessary to develop a particular AI application, or the user has a need to develop conventional applications in conventional languages more productively. \nThe end user of AI Workstation-based applications views the AI Workstation as an execution environment for applications that are highly interactive, intelligent, and customizable. The end user benefits from the total system, with high-resolution graphics, color displays, local area networks, multiple windows, and special-purpose input devices. The AI Workstation is modular and scalable so that a particular application can run with a minimum of resources and therefore keep the delivery vehicle’s cost as low as possible. This is a major feature for many AI Workstation users who wish to both develop and distribute applications using the AI Workstation. To these users, providing a low-cost delivery vehicle is a major concern.\nThe AI Workstation also supports the notion of a server. A server is a system that is located on a network, dedicated to running a particular application. Other systems on the network, possibly even other servers, can send requests to the server to perform a function. The server performs the task and when appropriate, responds to the sender. AI Workstation-based servers and workstations make it easy for applications to create and send programs back and forth. A machine receiving a program is able to execute the program within the context of its local environment. Networks of servers running AI Workstation-based applications may prove to be a cost-effective solution for many users.\nThere has already been a great deal written about the large potential for productivity and quality improvements in software development, and given the rising cost of software development, there is a high demand for such improvements. Traditionally, AI researchers have demanded more productive and powerful software engineering tools from their environments. This was necessary to manage the scope and complexity of their software systems. Now that personal workstations are cost-effective, a wide range of software engineering tools, previously feasible only on expensive mainframes or special-purpose hardware, are now available for the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.\nTHE TECHNOLOGY\nThe evolution of the technology underlying the AI Workstation began with a joint development effort by HP Laboratories and the University of Utah. The goal of this effort was to create a portable, high-performance implementation of a modern Lisp system so that programmers could enjoy efficiency and portability comparable to C and Fortran, along with the interactive and incremental program development and debugging environment of Lisp.\nPreviously, to enjoy high performance from Lisp, special-purpose, expensive hardware was required. A major contribution of the resulting underlying Lisp technology is that it is efficient even on conventional, low-cost hardware. \nLisp\nLisp is the dominant programming language for artificial intelligence research in the United States. But why Lisp? From a historical standpoint, Lisp is second in endurance and longevity only to Fortran. The modern Lisp systems, such as Hewlett-Packard’s implementation of Common Lisp feature less cryptic alternatives to the basic Lisp commands, as well as many of the control structures and data types that have proven useful in conventional languages. Although Lisp has evolved from its original form, it is for the most part as it was designed in 1958 by John McCarthy. Unlike Fortran, however, Lisp is attracting new converts daily, and is more popular today than it has ever been in its 28-year history. Unfortunately, many programmers in the industry today have not yet had the opportunity to work with Lisp as a production language, thus making it difficult to compare Lisp with C, Pascal, Fortran, or COBOL. A discussion of the primary features of Lisp follows, so that programmers of conventional languages can get an idea of what it is like to develop in a Lisp environment.\n– Lisp supports incremental development. In conventional languages, when trying to build a program incrementally, the programmer must perform a number of time-consuming tasks, such as writing procedure stubs, including declarations, and constructing or simulating data. Each iteration requires an edit/compile/link/test cycle. In contrast, the Lisp programmer can simply write a function in terms of other functions that may or may not have been written yet and build either in a top-down fashion or in a bottom-up fashion, creating and testing continuously. The function can be executed as soon as it has been typed in.\n– Lisp programs don’t need declarations. Unlike C, Pascal, COBOL and most other conventional languages in which the programmer must specify the data structures and variables before using them, Lisp allocates the right amount of storage, when it is needed, automatically. This allows the programmer to develop functions truly “on the fly,” without maintaining and propagating declarations throughout the program. Once a program has stabilized, the programmer can add declarations to improve the efficiency. \n– Lisp provides excellent debugging. The Lisp environment supports an attitude towards error diagnosis that is quite different from that induced by conventional programming languages. When a bug is encountered during development of a Lisp program, the Lisp environment invites the programmer to explore the environment in which the exception was detected. The full power of Lisp itself is available to the programmer when debugging. Data structures can be analyzed and functions redefined. In fact, the programmer can even construct new Lisp functions on the fly to help diagnose the problem. In Lisp, a program error is less an error and more a break point where the programmer can examine the system.\n– Lisp manages memory automatically for the programmer. Memory management and reclamation are taken care of automatically in a Lisp environment. With conventional languages, memory management often accounts for a significant portion of the programmer’s code. In Lisp systems, however, Lisp itself tracks memory use and reclaims unneeded storage automatically. This service allows the programmer to concentrate on the problem at hand, without having to manage the resources needed to implement the problem’s solution.\n– Lisp programs can easily create or manipulate other Lisp programs. Lisp is unique among major languages in that Lisp programs and data are represented with the same data structure. The benefits that result from this characteristic are many, and have proven to be among the major contributions to the power of Lisp. This characteristic, for example, makes it easy to write Lisp programs that create other Lisp programs, as well as to write Lisp programs that can understand other Lisp programs. Programs can be manipulated as data, and can be immediately executed or transferred to another Lisp machine for execution.\n– Lisp programs can run with a mix of compiled and interpreted code. The AI Workstation provides both a Lisp compiler and a Lisp interpreter. For development, the interpreter allows enhanced debugging and quick incremental design. Once a program is ready to be put into use, it can be compiled to increase its performance and reduce its code size. During development, however, the programmer often needs to run with a mix of compiled and interpreted code. The AI Workstation’s Lisp has the feature of allowing an arbitrary combination of compiled and interpreted code. It is not unusual for a programmer to redefine compiled functions at run time to examine and explore the behavior of the application.\n– Lisp is comfortable with symbols. In conventional languages, arbitrary symbols are treated as unstructured data. The programmer coerces them into a character array and analyzes the array byte by byte until some sense can be made out of them in terms of the data types understood by the language. Lisp, however, is a symbolic programming language. Arbitrary symbols are first-class objects, and can be manipulated as symbols rather than by trying to treat them as elements in an array. The programmer, in turn, can give symbols properties and manipulate relationships between symbols.\n– Lisp is easy to extend. Functions defined by the programmer are treated in the same way as system-defined functions. When implementing complex systems, it is often useful to develop a specific vocabulary of functions for conversing in a particular problem domain. With Lisp, these specific, problem-oriented languages can be developed easily and quickly.\nBecause of its longevity and its many useful features, the reader may wonder why conventional programmers have not been using Lisp for years. There are three major reasons for this.\nFirst, until very recently, the Lisp environments described above were available only on large and expensive machines, and even on these machines, Lisp was using more than its share of resources. Only now, with the availability of inexpensive, high-performance workstations and improved compiler technology, has Lisp become a cost-effective solution for conventional software development.\nSecond, production languages were previously judged largely on the efficiency of compiled code. Now that the constrained resource is the software development cost rather than the delivery machine hardware, languages are being judged based on a different set of values.\nThird, while the features of Lisp described above are valuable, they do not come without a cost. Most Lisp systems remain ill-suited for such problems as real-time and security-sensitive applications. Reducing these costs is a major research topic at many university and industrial research laboratories. At HP, we have acknowledged the fact that different languages are optimized to solve different problems, and we have provided the ability for the Lisp environment to access arbitrary C, Pascal, and Fortran routines. This has important ramifications for HP and its customers. \nIt is not necessary to discard existing code and data libraries to enjoy the benefits of Lisp. For example, an intelligent front end that accesses Fortran code libraries for instrument control can be written in Lisp. (The extensions to Common Lisp for foreign function calling are part of the Hewlett-Packard Development Environment for Common Lisp product.)\nAI Workstation-based applications are often blends of Lisp and conventional language components.\nObject-Oriented Programming\nThe AI Workstation provides two higher-level languages, themselves implemented in Lisp, which support alternative paradigms for software development. The first of these language extensions supports object-oriented programming, while the second supports rule-based programming. HP provides a Lisp-based object-oriented programming language. (The extensions to Common Lisp for object-oriented programming are part of the Hewlett-Packard Development Environment for Common Lisp product.) \nMost of the AI Workstation’s environment itself is written using this technology. Object-oriented programming is very much on the rise throughout the entire industry, and for good reason. Object-oriented programming brings to the programmer a productive and powerful paradigm for software development. It is a paradigm that addresses head-on the serious problems of code reusability and software maintainability by employing powerful techniques such as inheritance, data abstraction, encapsulation, and generic operations. \nUnlike most conventional languages, object-oriented Lisp is a language designed to support a particular programming methodology. The methodology, with support from the language, provides explicit facilities for code reusability, software maintainability, program extensibility, and rapid development. \nThe essential idea in object-oriented programming is to represent data by a collection of objects, and to manipulate data by performing operations on those objects. Each object defines the operations that it can perform.\nThe first facility I will describe is the notion of data abstraction. Using the object-oriented style of programming, each object is regarded as an abstract entity, or “black box,” whose behavior is strictly determined by the operations that can be performed on it. In other words, the only way an object is accessed or modified is by performing the operations explicitly defined on that object. In particular, the internal data structure used to represent the object is private, and is directly accessed only by the operations defined on the object. Operations are invoked by sending messages to the object.\nOne advantage of the object-oriented style of programming is that it encapsulates in the implementation of an object, the knowledge of how the object is represented. The behavior of an object is determined by its external interface, which is the set of operations defined on the object. If the designer changes the representation of an object, and the externally visible behavior of the operations is unchanged, then no source code that uses the object need be changed.\nFor example, suppose we wish to define a type dog. Using the object-oriented extensions to Common Lisp, our definition might be:\n  (define-type dog\n    (:var name)\n    (:var age)\n    (:var owner)\n    ) \nThis says that we are defining a new type of object dog, with an internal representation consisting of a name, an age, and an owner. For example:\n   (setf fido (make-instance ‘dog :name “Fido”))\nThis sets the variable fido to an instance of the type dog, with the name “Fido.” If we wished, we could create one hundred instances of the type dog, each unique, whether or not they have the same name (just as there are many dogs, with more than one named “Fido”). Note that externally, nothing knows of our internal representation of the type dog. We could be implementing the dog’s internal representation any number of ways.\nWe define operations on type dog by specifying the type and the operation, any parameters required by the operation, and the implementation of the operation. For example, to define an operation that will let us change the dog’s owner:\n   (define-method (dog :give-new-owner) (new-owner)\n      (setf owner new-owner)\nNote that the implementation of the operation is the only place where the internals of type dog are referenced. The value of this encapsulation is that if we decide to change the implementation of type dog, then it is only the type definition and the operations defined on that type that need to be modified.\nWe can access and manipulate the object by sending messages to it requesting it to perform specific operations. For example, to change Fido’s owner to “Mandy”: \n  (-> fido :give-new-owner “Mandy”) \nThis statement reads, “Send the message to fido :give-new-owner ‘Mandy’.” \nTypically, we would define a number of operations for the type dog, such as sit, stay, come, and speak. These could then be invoked:\n  (-> fido :sit)\n  (-> fido :stay)\n  (-> fido :come)\n  (-> fido :speak)\nThe second facility I will describe addresses the problem of code reusability. To a certain extent, the data abstraction facilities described above help ease the reuse of code modules in that the implementation is encapsulated, and the external interface is well-defined.\nMore directly applicable to this problem is the concept of inheritance. A new type of object can be defined that inherits from other types. All of the operations that manipulate the types and the data maintained by the types are inherited. A new type definition the selectively override specific characteristics of the types that it inherits from. Thus, to define a new type that is only slightly different from some existing type, one might simply have the new type inherit from the existing type and override those aspects that differ in the new type. For example, to define a new type of dog, golden-retriever:\n  (define-type golden-retriever\n    (:inherit-from dog)\n    (:var number-of-tennis-balls-retrieved)\n    )\nThis says that we want to define a new type golden-retriever, which inherits the data and operations from the type dog. In addition to the inherited attributes, we define golden-retriever’s to maintain the attribute number-of-tennis-balls-retrieved. Note that when using an object, one cannot observe whether or not that object’s type was defined using inheritance. \nWe create an instance of the new type golden-retriever: \n  (setf mac (make-instance ‘golden-retriever :name “Mac”))\n For this new type of dog, we would have our own implementation of the :speak operation, one that produces a deeper bark than the inherited version. We would also have some additional operations defined which are appropriate only with objects of the type golden-retriever.\nFor example, we have the additional operation fetch, which of course is an attribute of all retrievers, but not all dogs, as well as the new operation :make-coffee (Mac is a very smart dog).\nThese could then be invoked:\n  (-> mac :speak)\n  (-> mac :fetch)\n  (-> mac :make-coffee :time 0700) \nNote that we could have made further use of inheritance by first defining a type retriever that inherited from type dog, and then defining the new types golden-retriever and labrador-retriever which inherit from the type retriever.\nAnother facility provided by object-oriented Lisp is the support of a powerful form of generic operations known as polymorphism.\nWhen one performs an operation on an object, one is not concerned with what kind of object it is, but rather that an operation is defined on the object with the specified name and the intended behavior. This ability is lacking in languages like Pascal, where each procedure can accept only arguments of the exact types that are declared in the procedure header.\nAs an example of the value of generic operations, suppose one day we attempt to replace Man’s Best Friend with a robot, presumably one domesticated to the same extent as a dog is. We could implement the new type robot as follows: \n  (define-type robot\n    (:var name)\n    (:var model)\n    (:var owner)\n     )\nTo create an instance of type robot: \n  (setf roby (make-instance, robot :name ‘Roby”))\nSuppose that we have an existing library of applications that direct objects of the type golden-retriever in various tasks. If we were to implement the same functional operations performed by objects of type golden-retriever for the type robot, then all of our application code would work unchanged: \n  (-> roby :sit)\n  (-> roby :stay)\n  (-> roby :come)\n  (-> roby :fetch)\n  (-> roby :speak)\n  (-> roby :make-coffee :time 0700)\nNote that while the implementations of these operations differ, the functional specification and the external protocol robot dealing with objects of type golden-retriever and robot are defined to be the same, so our applications work unchanged, and we save on dog food, too.\nThe facilities of object-oriented programming described here can go a long way towards improving program maintainability, program extensibility, and code reusability.\nObject-oriented programming has been used to implement operating systems, window managers, market simulations, word processors, program editors, instrument controllers, and games, to name just a few of its applications. Its paradigm has proven productive, powerful, and easy to learn and use.\nRule-Based Programming\nThe second of the alternative paradigms provided in the AI Workstation is the Hewlett Packard Representation Language (HP-RL), HP’s experimental rule-based programming language.\nHP-RL is intended to support the development of knowledge-based software systems. Knowledge-based software systems, which include expert systems, are systems that search a knowledge base of information and attempt to make deductions and draw conclusions using the rules of logical inference. A knowledge base is a database that embodies the knowledge and problem-solving strategies of human experts.\nIn an expert system, there is rarely a procedural description defined in advance for solving a problem. The system must search the knowledge base and make inferences by using the rules and strategies defined by the developer. Current knowledge-based software systems include applications such as medical consultation systems, integrated circuit diagnostic systems, tax advisors, and natural language understanding systems. The key to knowledge-based systems lies in representing the vast amounts of knowledge in an organized and manageable structure. Without such organization, problems quickly become intractable. An intractable problem is one that cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of computation time. HP-RL provides data structures and control structures specifically for knowledge representation, knowledge organization, and reasoning about that knowledge. HP-RL allows knowledge to be represented as frames.\nA frame is a data structure that groups together arbitrary amounts of information that are related semantically.  Typically, a frame is used to store information specific to, or about, a particular entity. HP-RL allows knowledge to be organized into frames of related information. Like object oriented programming, HP-RL provides the ability for frames to inherit information from other frames. \nFor example, a frame that describes a specific entity such as a person, Jane, might inherit characteristics from related entities such as scientist and female. Therefore, the entity Jane automatically inherits all of the attributes of females and scientists. Attributes specific to Jane can then be specified to differentiate Jane from other female scientists.\nFrames can be grouped into domains of knowledge. This sort of partitioning reduces problem complexity, and can also improve the efficiency of searches through the knowledge base by helping the program avoid searching through irrelevant knowledge. Searching through the knowledge base is a sophisticated process performed by the HP-RL inference engine. The inference engine is the facility that scans the knowledge base trying to satisfy rules. Rules in HP-RL are frames composed of a set of premises and conclusions, similar to an if-then construct in conventional languages. HP-RL provides both forward chaining and backward chaining rules. The inference engine applies forward chaining, or data driven, rules to infer conclusions given verified premises. The inference engine applies backward chaining, or goal driven, rules to find verifiable premises, given a desired conclusion.\nAs an example, consider a rule that says: If a dog is a golden retriever, then the dog likes tennis balls.\nIf we define the rule to be a forward chaining rule, then when the inference engine is searching the knowledge base, if the current data supports the assertion that the dog is a golden retriever, then we can infer that the dog likes tennis balls.\nIf we define the rule to be a backward chaining rule, then when the inference engine is searching the knowledge base, if the desired goal is to find a dog that likes tennis balls, then the inference engine will check to see if the current data supports the assertion that the dog is a golden retriever.\nOne of the primary differences between rule-based approaches and conventional programming is that in rule based programs, the program’s flow of control is not explicit in the program. The process of deciding what to do next is consciously separated from data organization and management. The programmer can help direct searches by using heuristics. A heuristic is a rule that guides us in our navigation and search through a knowledge base. Managing searches through the knowledge base is a major research topic, since an intelligent and selective search of a knowledge base can make the difference between a usable system and an unusable system.\nSearching the knowledge base is where most of the computing resources are spent when using a knowledge-based system. To help with this problem, HP-RL provides for the incorporation of heuristics about dealing with other heuristics, which can be used to govern the strategy of the program and therefore conduct searches more intelligently. HP-RL currently contains a number of experimental facilities which are being studied and tested to discover more effective mechanisms for performing the difficult task of capturing and using knowledge.\nTHE ENVIRONMENT\nOne of the primary differences between programming with Lisp and programming with other languages is the environment provided for the programmer. The AI Work station provides access to all data and execution via an integrated environment. The user environment is unusually flexible and powerful. It contains a large and powerful collection of text-manipulation functions and data structures useful in constructing user interfaces, text and graphics editors, and browsers. The following sections explore these various components of the AI Workstation user environment.\nEditing\nThe AI Workstation environment contains a version of EMACS, an editor originally developed by Richard Stallman at MIT. Hewlett-Packard’s object-oriented Lisp implementation of EMACS, like the original MIT EMACS, is a customizable, extensible, self-documenting, screen oriented, display editor.\nCustomizable means that users can mold the AI Workstation EMACS in subtle ways to fit personal style or editing tasks. Many user-level commands exist to allow the user to change the environment’s behavior dynamically. Customization is not limited to programmers; anyone can easily customize the environment.\nExtensible means that the user can make major modifications and extensions to the AI Workstation EMACS. New editing commands can be added or old ones changed to fit particular editing needs, while the user is editing. The user has a full library of text-manipulation functions at hand for the creation of new editing functions. This type of extensibility makes EMACS editors more flexible than most other editors. Users are not constrained to living with the decisions made by the implementers of the AI Workstation EMACS. If the user has a need for a new function, or a reason to modify the behavior of an existing function, then the user is able to make the modification quickly and easily.\nSelf-documenting means that the AI Workstation EMACS provides powerful interactive self-documentation facilities so that the user can make effective and efficient use of the copious supply of features.\nScreen-oriented means that the user edits in two dimensions, so the page on the screen is like a page in a book, and the user has the ability to scroll forward or backward at will through the book. As the user edits the page, the screen is updated immediately to reflect the changes made. Just as many books on a desk can be open and in use at once, with the AI Workstation EMACS, many screens can be visible and active simultaneously. In fact, one of HP’s extensions to MIT’s EMACS is the ability not only to have multiple screens active on a single physical display, but also to have multiple screens on multiple physical displays. (The EMACS-based editing environment described here is part of the Hewlett-Packard Development Environment for Common Lisp product.)\nBrowsing\nAnother feature of the AI Workstation user environment is a large library of tools known as browsers. Browsers are more than an integral component of the user environment; they are a metaphor for using the environment. A browser is a simple tool for the convenient perusal and manipulation of a particular set of items.\nExperimental browsers in the AI Workstation environment include documentation browsers, file browsers, mail browsers, source code browsers, and application browsers. These browsers range from simple to very complex. Users can list all the mail messages sent by a particular person regarding a particular subject, or can instantly retrieve the definition of a particular Lisp function.\nThe user can conduct automated searches of the documentation, or can browse and manipulate the contents of a complex data structure. Browsers provide a simple, intuitive, integrated interface that is useful for handling a wide range of problems. The environment provides a library of browser construction tools and functions to allow users to create their own browsers for their particular applications and needs.\nProgramming\n On the AI development machine, a large portion of the user environment is tuned to support the programming task, which includes activities such as program editing, debugging, testing, version and configuration management, and documentation. \nThe AI Workstation supports development in Lisp, C, Pascal, and Fortran. In addition, a toolkit is provided to let users customize the environment for other languages. The AI Workstation provides an integrated and uniform model of multilingual software development. One of the major features of the AI Workstation user environment is the interface to the underlying Lisp system. Lisp programmers enjoy direct access to the Lisp compiler and interpreter without having to leave the environment. This means that a program can be edited, tested, debugged, and documented incrementally and interactively as the program is developed. The editing is assisted by an editor that understands the syntax of Lisp. Testing is assisted by Lisp interface commands, which pass the text from the program editor to the underlying Lisp system and return the results back to the environment. Debugging is assisted by an interactive debugger, function stepper, and data inspector available directly from the environment. Program documentation is assisted by documentation tools designed for the programmer which generate much of the formatting details automatically.\nUsing the foreign function calling facilities of the AI Workstation described earlier, non-Lisp programmers can also enjoy many of the benefits of interactive, incremental development. For example, the AI Workstation contains full two- and three-dimensional vector and raster graphics operations. (The graphics facilities referred to are provided on the HP 9000 Series 300 running under the HP-UX operating system.) While these operations are C routines, all are directly accessible from the Lisp environment.\nTypically, C programmers must iterate through the edit/compile/link/test cycle as they develop a graphics application. In contrast, using the AI Workstation, C programmers can step through the development of their graphics applications statement by statement, and enjoy immediate feedback simply by observing the results on the screen. Once the program is functionally correct, the programmer can convert the statements into a formal C program, and compile it with the standard C compiler.\nManaging\nThe AI Workstation user environment contains a variety of optional service applications to support the programmer in dealing with office and management functions. Experimental applications developed with this technology include electronic mail, project management, documentation preparation, slide editing, calendar, spreadsheet, information management, and telephone services. Each of these applications, once the user chooses to include it, becomes an integral part of the environment. Because all of these applications are written using the AI Workstation environment facilities, they are customizable, extensible, and accessible from anywhere in the environment.\nFor example, the user can move from creating a slide, to reading a mail message, to testing Lisp code, and back to creating the slide.\nInterfacing\nThe AI Workstation’s user environment contains tools that greatly simplify the incorporation of new input and output devices such as tablets, touchscreens, or voice synthesizers. In addition to supporting standard keyboard and mouse input, experimental versions of the AI Workstation environment also support joystick, tablet, touchscreen, videodisc, voice input and output, and touch tone telephone input. The user environment also supports many user interface models, and provides a library of environment functions to help users define their own user interface model. Existing user interface models include pop-up menus, softkeys, English commands, and CONTROL-META key sequences.\nThe AI Workstation does not impose a particular interface model on the user. Default interfaces exist, but the user is free to modify or add any user interface desired. Delivery applications written to run under the AI Workstation environment can choose to use one or more of the supplied user interfaces, or the designer can define a new interface.\nTHE APPLICATIONS\nThis section examines some of the primary types of applications the AI Workstation technology was designed to develop and run. Note that unless specified otherwise, these applications are experimental and not available for purchase.\nDiagnostic Systems\nDiagnostic systems are good examples of expert system applications. Diagnostic systems retrieve as much data as possible from instruments and/or users, and attempt to determine the cause of the problem and/or the remedy. Diagnostic system applications include medical diagnostic systems, instrument diagnostic systems, and intelligent computer-assisted instruction applications.\nAt HP Laboratories, we are experimenting with an 1C photolithography diagnosis system. This system, called the Photolithography Advisor, is an expert system used to diagnose failures in the negative photolithography resist stage of IC fabrication.\nWithin Hewlett-Packard’s computer support organization, a number of diagnostic expert systems are employed. The Schooner expert system diagnoses and corrects data communication problems between a terminal and an HP 3000. The AIDA expert system provides an efficient tool for analyzing HP 3000 core dump files. The Interactive Peripheral Troubleshooter system diagnoses disc drive failures.\nInstrument Control \nA growing class of expert systems deals with the intelligent control, monitoring, and testing of instruments, as well as the interpretation of the data gathered by these instruments. Instrument control and interpretation applications include network analysis, factory floor monitoring, process control, and many robotics applications.\nAt Hewlett-Packard, one experimental application helps with the interpretation and classification of data collected by a mass spectrometer. Another application analyzes data from a patient monitoring system. Within the AI industry, a number of intelligent instrument and process control applications are being developed, such as a system that monitors the operations of an oil refinery. \nSimulations\nMany complex software systems fall into the category of simulations and modeling. Simulations play major roles in nearly every aspect of a business. The object oriented programming facilities discussed earlier enable engineers to program simulations rapidly. Simulation applications include econometric modeling, flight simulation, chemical interaction modeling, and circuit simulations.\nAt HP Laboratories, for example, we have implemented VLSI logic simulators, which enable an engineer to design, debug, test, and evaluate circuit designs before incurring any actual manufacturing expense.\nThe HP Flight Planner/Flight Simulator is an application designed by HP Laboratories to illustrate a number of important features of the AI Workstation technology: namely, that multilingual applications are desirable and simple to develop, that complex applications can be developed rapidly, that Lisp applications can be designed to run without the interruption of garbage collections, and that Lisp applications can run on conventional hardware and operating systems at very high performance.\nThe Flight Planner module is a constraint-driven expert system for planning a flight. The system presents a detailed map of California stretching from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The pilot is asked for an originating airport, a final destination, and any intermediate stops desired. The pilot then is allowed to specify specific constraints, such as “Avoid oceans and mountain ranges,” “Ensure no longer than 3 hours between stops,” or “Plan a lunch stop in Santa Barbara.”\nThe system’s knowledge base includes data on the airports, the terrain, and the specifications and capabilities of a Cessna 172 airplane. With the constraints specified, the Flight Planner attempts to find a viable flight plan that satisfies the constraints specified by the pilot, as well as the constraints implied by the limitations of the terrain and aircraft. \nOnce a flight plan has been generated, the Flight Planner passes the flight plan off to the Flight Simulator module, which then flies the plan as specified. The flight plan specifies the destination, route, and cruise altitude for each leg of the flight. The flight simulator’s autopilot module, using these directions as well as the specific airport and airplane data from the knowledge base, performs the take-off, flies the plane using ground-based navigational aids, and executes an instrument landing.\nIn addition to flying predetermined flight plans via the autopilot, the Flight Simulator can be flown manually. The pilot uses an HP-HIL joystick, a 9-knob box, and a 32-button box as the controls. The Flight Planner is implemented using HP-RL.\nThe Flight Simulator is implemented in Common Lisp and the object-oriented extensions to Common Lisp. The graphical transformations are performed by C routines accessed from Lisp, using the 3D graphics facilities of the HP-UX operating system. The model of flight, the autopilot component, and the scene management are all written using the object oriented extensions to Common Lisp. The Flight Simulator required two months for two people to develop, while the Flight Planner required a month for three people.\nNatural Language\nWith the computational and reasoning capabilities of systems such as the AI Workstation, computational linguists are making headway into the difficult field of natural language understanding. At HP Laboratories, computational linguists have been using the AI Workstation to develop an experimental, domain independent, natural language understanding system. HP’s natural language system employs a hierarchically structured lexicon, a set of lexical rules to create derived lexical items, and a small set of context-free phrase structure rules as the data structures used in parsing English sentences and questions. Interpretations of these sentences are the result of the meanings of the individual words together with the semantic rules that are associated with each of the dozen or so phrase structure rules. \nWhat the natural language system produces is a set of unambiguous application independent expressions in first-order logic, each expression corresponding to one possible interpretation of the original sentence. In test applications, these expressions are transduced into either data base queries or messages to objects, making use of the domain-specific knowledge in each application to make precise those relations or pronoun bindings that were underspecified in the sentence itself.\nSoftware Engineering\nWhile environments such as the AI Workstation can significantly improve software productivity, we are just beginning to reap the benefits of applying AI to the software development process itself.\nThere are a number of projects throughout the industry working in this area. At HP Laboratories, we are working on intelligent programming environments that help the user assess the impact of potential modifications, determine which scenarios could have caused a particular bug, systematically test an application, coordinate development among teams of programmers, and support multilingual development in a uniform manner.\nOther significant software engineering applications include automatic programming, syntax-directed editors, automatic program testing, and intelligent language-based help facilities. Applying AI to the software development process is a major research topic.  There is tremendous potential for improving the productivity of the programmer, the quality of the resulting code, and the ability to maintain and enhance applications. One of HP’s first projects of this type is MicroScope, a tool to help software engineers understand the structure and behavior of complex software systems.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have discussed the AI Workstation from the point of view of the software market, the underlying technology, the user environment, and the AI-based applications. Having studied the AI Workstation from each of these perspectives, we hope that the reader will assimilate this into a coherent and accurate view of the HP AI Workstation technology.\nOver the coming years, HP engineers and our partner universities will be using the AI Workstation as a platform for exploring increasingly intelligent and powerful applications and technologies.\nAcknowledgments\nSince the AI Workstation is defined to be the aggregate of HP’s research in the AI area, the efforts of well over 100 people at Hewlett-Packard divisions and universities around the United States are represented.

MBA programs don’t teach people how to create companies … our position is that we hire someone in spite of an MBA, not because of one.” – Elon Musk\nThis is a belief that has ebbed and flowed in Silicon Valley for several decades.  \nI understand where they’re coming from, but I’m not one of those people.  I have hired and coached many exceptionally strong people straight from top business schools, and I know many more such people.\nMoreover, in my own experience, I’ve found that many of the students accepted into top MBA programs often have the right raw materials to be coached and developed into exceptionally strong product managers, and eventually very strong product and company leaders.\nThat said, even with the very best, there is usually some critically important coaching and “unlearning” that needs to be done.  And when that coaching doesn’t happen, I see it leading to many of the serious issues we see in companies today, especially those that are victims of disruption. \nAnd to be clear here, I’m not just talking about product managers and product leaders.\nI’m also talking about VC’s and other investors, Board Members, CEO’s, CFO’s, and GM’s/business unit leaders and countless other stakeholders.  \nIf you’re not willing to coach and develop these MBA grads to help them unlearn, then you may indeed be better off avoiding MBA hires.  But to me, the prize makes it worth the effort.  These are often very high-potential people.  And I’m not alone.  Several of the top product companies recruit directly out of top business school programs.  They just know they need to “de-program” the students, as one of my friends from Google refers to the coaching process.\nThese problems have long been attributed to the fact that MBA programs were originally designed to teach industrial style command-and-control style management thinking.  \nWhile I think this has long been true, and sadly is still largely true, I also think it’s oversimplified.  Today’s MBA programs are not all bad, and the people that graduate from them are most definitely not all bad.\nRather than risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater, I believe it’s worth looking deeper into the pathology.\nI loosely categorize the problematic thinking and behaviors into four major areas:\nEquating Management With Leadership\nEven putting aside for now the fact that the management style learned (command and control) is usually exactly wrong for a tech-powered company (discussed below), there is still this deeply rooted conflation of management with leadership.  \nThe belief that managers are inherently supposed to be viewed as leaders. Or more generally, believing they are supposed to act like “the boss.”  \nIn fairness, it’s hard to blame someone that’s just paid a boatload of money, and dedicated two years of their life, for a degree in business management, for thinking it’s their birthright to step into the role of the boss.  \nAnd remember that ambition and competitiveness are effectively selected for in admittance to these top programs. \nFor those going straight from business school to a product management job, this can be especially problematic.  Many times I have had to intervene with serious coaching about how as product manager, you are actually not the boss of anyone.   As a product manager, you are an individual contributor.  You are true peers with your designer and engineers.  Moreover, you need to earn your spot as part of the team.  And this typically requires skills that you didn’t learn in business school.\nNot Knowing What You Can’t Know\nAnd related to this problem of not knowing what you can’t know, is not admitting what you don’t know.  Also very related is the illusion of predictability.\nThis one is tough.  The belief in predictability, the religion of business cases, the blind faith in business analytics, and more generally, the pressure to have “the answer.”\nThe premise of product discovery is that with technology-powered products, we can’t know in advance how much revenue we’ll make, or even whether customers will purchase our products, or what something will cost to build.\nThis can be hard to unlearn.  Most of us figure this out with experience, but what hinders so many MBA graduates is that they believe they are supposed to know these things, and if they don’t, that speaks to their own weaknesses, rather than an acknowledgement of the realities of innovation.\nAgain, these are important and often necessary coaching topics, especially for product managers.\nThe Role of Technology\nOne of the most serious and deeply rooted problems is thinking of technology as a cost center, rather than the core enabler of the business.  How many ways, both explicit and implicit, in the typical MBA program, is the message sent that the manager is the one responsible for the decisions, and we can simply hire engineers and designers to do their bidding?  \nIs it any surprise so many think of the engineers and designers as subordinates?  Or even worse, as resources that can just as easily be outsourced?  I tackle this with explicit coaching along with a constant stream of examples from our industry.\nCommand and Control Leadership Style\nNow don’t get me wrong, I doubt very much anyone sits down in a lecture to hear a professor list the virtues of “command and control” as a leadership style.  I’m suggesting this is inferred or implied.  Consider the many case studies, guest speakers, business books, and the whole mythology around business leaders, where the leader is command and control personified.\nYet the best tech-powered product companies know that empowered teams are where innovation comes from, not from top-down business strategy sessions.  As Reed Hastings of Netflix emphasizes, “lead with context, not control,” and work to push decisions down to the teams.\nTo be clear here, I’m not suggesting leaders shouldn’t lead (a common misconception in certain Agile circles).  They absolutely should.  It’s about how they lead.\nI have come to believe that these problems are baked into most MBA programs.  For a company that believes it needs to transform, these issues may need to be unlearned by the key senior leadership team.\nBut I’d like to dig deeper into the problem of MBA’s becoming product managers.\nBeyond the four problems discussed above, I attribute much of the MBA pathology as it pertains to product managers on the old CPG (consumer packaged goods / brand manager) style product manager.\nA few years ago, Martin Eriksson wrote a good article describing this history, and more recently Ken Norton highlighted this, so I won’t repeat the history here.  But today, I have a much deeper appreciation for just how fundamentally different technology product management is from those CPG product managers (which today are much more closely aligned with what we in the tech world would call product marketing managers).\nAnd to be sure, there is still a need for product managers of CPG products.  I don’t know if there are more CPG product managers or technology product managers globally, but I’m pretty sure that the real growth is in technology product managers (as nearly all products are becoming technology-powered products).\nYet even today, if you peruse the online catalogs of the major MBA programs, especially any courses specifically teaching product management, you’ll find most of the faculty are professors of marketing.\nNow, no question that good marketing is hard and valuable, and marketing knowledge definitely helps the product manager have a better understanding of go-to-market considerations, but many other backgrounds are at least as important.  \nHow much of this is simply a remnant of the CPG legacy?  How much is a consequence of viewing product through a marketing lens?\nIf you were responsible for developing a new brand of soap, or a new brand of beer, this was considered primarily a marketing exercise, and not an innovation exercise.\nI remember way back when I wanted to learn product management, the person that was coaching me told me explicitly to ignore the books that had been published on product management, because he said that while they used the same job title, they were referring to a very different context.  I understand now what he meant.\nCertainly pricing, placement, and promotion still matter, but nothing like they did in the days of Mad Men.  Today, product discovery in a technology-powered product company is dominated by deep collaboration with engineering and design in order to combine enabling technology with exceptional user experience in ways that provide real value to the customers and to your business.\nHow many MBA programs are teaching this sort of collaboration, versus still teaching the CPG model where the product manager builds a business case, based on predictions of revenue, and expected expenses for design and engineering, and then defines requirements, and finally looks for someone to implement their brilliant ideas?\nMy suspicion is that most of the MBA faculty are unaware of their implicit biases on all this, but I think the evidence that it’s happening, and has been happening for decades, is compelling.\nThe Perfect Storm of Bad Product\nIn recent years I’ve observed that when the CSPO pathology and the MBA pathology converge in the same company, the results are especially dangerous.\nIn many companies, especially larger and older companies that don’t yet understand the role of technology, you often have literally hundreds of stakeholders and executives that were educated in the MBA pathology, in particular the dependence on command and control style leadership and the illusion of predictability, and they meet an eager market of Agile coaches that tell them exactly what they want to hear – they can have the top-down, command and control they love, and still check the “Agile” box (if the process has Agile in its name it must be Agile, right?) – all they need to do is adopt the right process.  Hence the perfect incubator for a disease like SAFe.\nI’m not trying to rehash all the reasons this is a particularly deadly disease.  I just want to try to highlight that this disease is enabled by these two pathologies.  \nSummary\nTo be very clear, I’m not arguing here that an MBA is inherently bad, as some of the best product people I know came from that path.\nI’m just arguing that the majority of MBA programs are explicitly and implicitly instilling some obsolete and detrimental values that are damaging their companies, and impacting their company’s ability to transform into a strong product company.\nIn order to transform, these people need to unlearn these beliefs if they hope to compete with the best companies, and avoid becoming yet another victim of disruption.\nFor those considering an MBA and seeking my thoughts, I rarely encourage people to pursue the degree, as I think there are much better uses of their time and money if they want to pursue a career in product, product leadership, or to start their own company.\nBut if you really want to pursue an MBA, then make sure it’s from one of the top programs as the main value is from the contacts and networking.  Also, if you have at least a couple years of actual work experience from a good empowered product company before b-school, you’ll largely be immune to the four issues I described above.\nToday, most MBA programs have at least a couple faculty and courses that are more modern, but the problem is that the totality of the messages that students hear is still overwhelmingly command-and-control.\nBecause of the nature of this article, I reached out to a broad set of expert reviewers to get their perspectives, including Shreyas Doshi, Ken Norton, and my SVPG Partners, Chris, Christian, Lea and Jon, and I thank them all for their feedback and suggestions.\nUPDATE:\nAfter reading the article, several people have asked me about my experiences with Executive MBA programs.  First, in the spirit of full disclosure, I did one of those programs aimed at Tech Executives many years ago at Stanford University.  It was a summer program, and it was paid for by my company, and I enjoyed it and learned a good amount, especially from the case study method.  Second, the big difference I see is that in general people attending these Executive MBA programs already have significant work experience, and they are enrolling to fill some specific knowledge gaps.\nAnd once more for those that missed this in the original article: I have, and continue to, hire many exceptional people from these programs, so I am most definitely not one of those that dismisses all MBAs.  I am just sharing that I’ve found these four problematic behaviors need to be assessed and if necessary, coached to ensure the person succeeds.  Just as with people that come from engineering backgrounds, like I did, or design backgrounds, or any other background.  Pretty much everyone has gaps and needs coaching.  These are just the common patterns I see for those coming from MBA programs.  Consider it a possible starting point for your coaching.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-mba-pathology/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925813177,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Nature of Product - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI spend so much of my time coaching, writing, and talking about how different it is to build products at strong product companies versus the rest.\nWhen a product person, or especially a product coach, has not yet had the good fortune to work on a strong product team at a strong product company, then one of the most essential concepts of all, is to try to convey the fundamental nature of technology-powered products.\nPeople often think they understand this, but they usually don’t.  And in truth, until you’ve personally experienced it, it’s hard to grasp.  I often feel like I’m trying to describe what the Grand Canyon looks like in real life to someone that’s only seen photos.\nSo much of what I’ve written is essentially trying to describe this concept from every angle I can think of.  Trying to capture the dynamics of the necessary collaboration.  The source of real inspiration.  The obsession with innovating on behalf of our customers.  The rapid and persistent prototyping, testing and iteration.  And how fundamentally different all this is from what roadmap-driven feature-teams do.\nIn this article, I’d like to share how Steve Jobs tried to explain this concept.\nIn 1995, after he had been fired from his own company, and had some time to contemplate what he’d learned, he was interviewed for a PBS Documentary called Triumph of the Nerds.  They only used 10 minutes or so in the eventual documentary, but it turns out that the full 70-minute interview was lost in shipping.  \nIt wasn’t until after Steve Jobs passed away years later that the director found a copy of that full interview buried in his garage (in Silicon Valley there is always a garage in the story ;), and watching the interview in light of how he had saved Apple from the brink of bankruptcy, the director realized the treasure he now had in his possession.\nYou can – and you absolutely should – watch the full interview here.  I consider the hour you’ll spend watching this very likely one of the most valuable hours of your professional development.\nHe covers a wide range of product topics, including the nature of technology-powered products, but also the dynamics of strong product teams, what he considers “the disease of process people,” the perils of product roadmaps, why so many companies lose their product mojo, and the consequences of a CEO that comes from sales or marketing, rather than from product. \nWhile this interview is from 1995, it is remarkably, distressingly, relevant today.\nBut for this article, I’d like to highlight one particular segment, where he speaks to the nature of technology-powered products.\nIn this discussion, he is trying to point out that the common problem of stakeholders or customers picking their favorite ideas, and putting them on roadmaps, and how just telling their feature-teams to “build it” is destined to result in bad products.  He is trying to contrast that with how product works in strong product companies:\n“There’s just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.  \nAs you evolve that great idea, it changes and grows.  It never comes out like it starts, because you learn a lot more as you get into the subtleties of it.  And you also find there are tremendous trade-offs you have to make… \nDesigning a product is keeping 5000 things in your brain and fitting them all together in new and different ways to get what you want.  And every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently.”  \nThis is as good of a definition of product discovery as I’ve seen.  \nAnd it’s worth pointing out that he’s emphasizing solution discovery.  Too many product managers and product designers want to spend all their time in problem discovery, and not get their hands dirty in solution discovery – the whole nonsense of “product managers are responsible for the what and not the how.”\nHe goes on to provide some great analogies on the type of collaboration, and the type of people that are necessary, in order to evolve an idea to a great product, but hopefully I’ve convinced you it’s worth an hour of your time to watch this.\nAs you listen to him describe his view of the essential nature of product, try to contrast this with the way your company thinks of product.  Are the product teams just there to implement features for the business?  Is the company more concerned with following a process rather than discovering a valuable solution?\nIf so, and if you believe you need to transform in order to remain competitive, then I’d urge you to consider what he has to say.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-nature-of-product/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925815624,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Origin of Product Discovery - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI’ve been meaning to write this article for many years, but since it’s mainly historical in nature there have always been more pressing topics.  But every so often someone will reach out because they’re trying to track down the origin of the term, and during this pandemic, for whatever reason, I’ve been getting this question more frequently.\nFirst, let me be clear that the concept of product discovery has been around as long as software, and certainly much longer than I’ve been around.  \nWe have always had, and likely always will have, two essential problems in software: we need to figure out the right product, and then we have to build the product right.\nI’ve always been interested in both problems, but I think the first is harder and that’s where most innovation happens, so that’s where I focus most of my attention.\nStarting around 2005 I started trying out the term “discovery” for how we figure out what to build, and in 2007, I decided to go all in on the term, and since then I have referred to the first problem as discovery, and the second as delivery.\nIn 2007 I was working on the first edition of INSPIRED, and I had a publication deadline approaching, and I had to decide what, if any, term to use.  \nBack then, just about every product manager talked about “gathering and defining requirements,” but I considered this as one of the fundamental reasons why there were so many failed products out there.  To me, talking about defining requirements was not only misguided, but arrogant.\nI could also see that in good teams, products were conceived by true collaborations between engineers, designers and product managers.  Not by some product manager declaring “these are the requirements, now go and design and build this.”\nSo I wanted a term that conjured up a very different image in the minds of product managers and product teams.  I wanted them to have an open mind, to know what they can’t know, and admit what they don’t know.\nI wanted to emphasize that great products are the result of product, design and engineering working together to achieve an outcome, rather than just pushing requirements down the chain and shipping output.\nI wanted them to think in terms of “figuring out a solution to a problem we’ve been asked to solve” rather than “dictating the requirements of a feature we’ve been asked to build.”\nI found the term “discovery” from the pharmaceutical industry for the process they used to come up with a viable medication.  Unlike the software industry, the pharmaceutical industry acknowledged the risk up front.  They expected that many if not most of their medications would not end up being safe and effective enough to manufacture, distribute and sell.\nI also liked the term “discovery” because it was technique agnostic.  There are any number of techniques used to help with discovery, and new ones emerge all the time.  An MVP is a discovery technique, as is design thinking, as is customer development, as is “Jobs To Be Done.”\nThis was very important to me because I have seen so many techniques and methods come and go, so I didn’t want to explicitly associate with any of them.\nI also liked that the term “discovery” encouraged product teams to think about the risks of value, usability, feasibility and viability.\nIn general I’m reluctant to try to introduce new nomenclature.  It’s a hard thing to do, and even if people respond well, it takes time to spread, and you really need to pick your battles on things like that.\nBut today I’m happy to see so many product teams understand the concept, and have at least a reasonable understanding of how and why we do product discovery.\nNow my focus is more on making sure product teams are working in an environment where they are empowered to do product discovery, rather than just given roadmaps to build.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-origin-of-product-discovery/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925964277,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Power of Customer Misbehavior - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tThere are of course many ways to come up with significant new product ideas.  Historically, the two main approaches have been: 1) to try to assess the market opportunities and pick potentially lucrative areas where significant pain exists; and 2) to look at what the technology or data enables – what’s just now possible – and match that up with the significant pain.   You can think of the first as following the market, and the second as following the technology.  Either way can get you to product market fit.\nHowever, some of the most successful companies today have actually taken a third approach, and while it’s not appropriate for every company, I would like to suggest that this is an extremely powerful technique that’s largely under-utilized and under-appreciated in our industry.  This third alternative is to allow, and even encourage, our customers to use our products to solve problems other than what we planned for and officially support.\nThere is a relatively new book on this topic written by a long-time friend of mine, Mike Fisher, called The Power of Customer Misbehavior. This book tells the eBay story from a viral growth perspective, but there are several other very good examples in there too.  Admittedly, the book is a bit of a tough read as it is based on the research for Mike’s (second!) Ph.D., but the gist of the book is straightforward.\nWe realized very early on in the eBay situation that this was where much of the best innovation was happening, and we did everything we could think of to encourage and nurture customers using the eBay marketplace to be able to trade nearly anything.  While the marketplace may have been originally designed to facilitate trading things like electronics and collectibles, soon people started trading things like concert tickets, and fine art, and even cars.  As you might imagine, there are some very significant differences between safely buying and transporting a car, and buying a ticket that’s good for just one night and then worthless.\nWhat I’m essentially arguing for here is a platform strategy, but normally we associate a platform with a set of API’s that allow second or third parties to create additional services and solutions on our foundation.  Facebook’s platform is a good example of this.  But a platform strategy can also be designed to be utilized directly by customers.  Excel is an example of a general platform designed to be extended for new solutions by end customers.\nSome product people can get upset when they find customers using their products for unintended use cases.  Usually this concern is tied to the support obligations. However, I’m suggesting that this platform use case can be very strategic and well worth the investment to support, as if you find your customers using your product in ways you didn’t predict this is potentially very valuable info.  Dig in a little and learn what problem they are trying to solve, and why they believe your product might provide the right foundation.  Do this enough and you’ll soon see patterns and potentially some very big product opportunities.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tTransformed FAQ\n\t\n\tThis page is here to hold questions and answers that come up once the TRANSFORMED book is published and we...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tAlternatives To Product Managers\n\t\n\tI doubt anyone is surprised to learn that many people have been asking me about Brian Chesky’s recent comments.

Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRecently I was invited by my friends at DesignMap to discuss the topic of product vision, and one of the more popular ways of communicating a product vision, which is to use a visiontype (a prototype of a product vision).\nIf you would like to watch the webinar (about 60 min), you can find the recording here.\nThe topic of product vision has always generated a lot of questions, mainly because the term is used very loosely by many people in different contexts.  A while ago I published a Product Vision FAQ that tries to address many of the most common questions.\nA couple of days after recording that webinar, I met someone that tried to argue to me that Apple was “an extremely successful company even though they didn’t know how to innovate.”\nI wasn’t sure I was hearing this correctly.  The person went on to point out how in the early days of Apple, Steve Jobs got a demo at Xerox PARC (the renown Palo Alto Research Center) of an early desktop computer with a graphical user interface, and he “just copied that.”\nLet me just say that anyone that thinks someone can see a demo of a prototype, and then “just copy that” on an entirely different computer and ecosystem, into an actual viable product, has likely never tried to build a product before.  But I realized that this confusion could be a good teachable moment.\nWhat I do believe happened, is that the PARC demo inspired Steve Jobs’ product vision for what a desktop computer could be.  \nThe power of a compelling visiontype is that it helps you to imagine a future that could be, if only you could discover how to make that vision a reality.\nI was working as an engineer at HP Laboratories during this time (we were a short walk from PARC), and our team also received demos from PARC engineers (and likewise we showed our prototypes to them).\nThe PARC visits inspired our team as well (along with other impressive experimental prototypes from MIT’s Media Lab, the University of Utah Graphics Lab, and Brown University, among others), and not too long afterwards our lab director / product leader announced a new product vision which he termed “the domesticated computer.”\nI was one of many working on that product vision for several years, and I absolutely believed we were working on something truly important and worthy.  \nAs it turns out, we had bet on early AI technology that we realized too late was not nearly ready for productization (very big understatement), while Apple made much better choices on their enabling technology.  Falling in love with an enabling technology rather than the problem to solve was one of my early and painful lessons on product.\nBut the point is that the number of true innovations, both large and small, required to convert that product vision into product reality would take entire books to describe.\nMoreover, while there’s a bit of problem discovery that goes into a strong product vision, the vast majority of the product discovery work and hence innovation comes after the product vision, and is mainly solution discovery and of course product delivery.\nThe researchers at PARC did create an impressive and inspiring visiontype, but Xerox never had the company leadership skills, or the product leadership skills, to productize that research.\nApple was the first to discover and deliver this vision as an actual product.  And providing value to your customers and your company is what innovation is all about.  \nThis example also serves to highlight both the advantages and the risks of publicly sharing your product vision.  If you are trying to recruit employees and partners to join you in your pursuit of your product vision, then there are real benefits to sharing your vision.\nBut if you don’t have the ability to discover and deliver the actual products, then don’t be surprised if someone else ends up being the one that delivers on your product vision.  There is a long history of this happening in our industry.\nIf you’re interested, courtesy of the Computer History Museum, you can watch a demo of (a restored) Xerox Alto, where you’ll see what Steve Jobs and others saw in 1979: a very early desktop computer, with a mouse, a graphical user interface, local area networking, and even an early WYSIWYG editor and email application.  \nFor its time, the Alto was a powerful example of a compelling and inspiring vision of what the future could be.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-power-of-visiontypes/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925795570,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Product Model at Spotify - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Marty Cagan and Joakim Sundén \nMarty’s Note: \nI have been a long-time fan of Spotify.  The fact that they compete against some of the best product companies in the world (including Amazon, Apple and Google), yet they have continued to hold their own, and in many cases out-innovate their competition, has certainly earned my respect.\nYet I don’t think they get the credit in the product community they deserve.  I believe that’s mostly because people that think they know “The Spotify Model” are focused on the wrong things, and not what has made them such a strong, long-term competitor. So my hope with this article is to do what I can to help correct that.\nI reached out to my friend Joakim Sundén and asked if he’d collaborate with me on an article that illustrates that even though Stockholm is more than 5000 miles from Silicon Valley, the principles behind how Spotify and the world’s top product companies work are remarkably consistent, and have little to do with what most people think the Spotify Model is.\nFor those of you that don’t yet know Joakim, he was an early coach at Spotify as they were working to establish, then scale, their organization and product culture, and then he joined the famed Stockholm-based consultancy, Crisp as a partner.  He spends his time coaching companies moving to the product model.\nFor this article to make sense, you’ll want to have at least a high-level understanding of what the product operating model is, as this article will be comparing the Spotify model to the product model.  If you haven’t yet read the series of four articles, you should probably start here.\nBackground\nBy the late 2000s, Spotify had transformed the music industry by winning major record labels over to the idea that streaming is the future. \nBy 2014, the service had amassed 60 million active users, and the fight had now shifted to another battleground.  Many new competitors, including Google, Amazon, and Apple were getting ready to enter the fight with their own subscription streaming services. \nEasy access to music through streaming – which Spotify had fought so hard to achieve – was now table-stakes, rather than a differentiator.  Spotify needed to continue to innovate to maintain their market leadership.\nThe Product Operating Model\nWhen we discuss the product operating model, at the high level we are looking at three major dimensions:\nThe first is how the company decides the most important problems to solve – the product strategy. The second is how they solve those problems and discover solutions worth building – product discovery. And the third is how they build, test and deliver those solutions to their customers – product delivery.\nThis article will try to highlight how Spotify embraces and embodies the principles behind each of these three dimensions.\nHow You Decide Which Problems To Solve – Product Strategy\nSpotify’s CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek described the situation as being up against the “end-boss” in a video game.  “We are in the big leagues now, and [some of the world’s biggest companies] are gunning for us…. We believe the most important thing we can do to maximize our potential is to increase our differentiation compared to other services.”\nSpotify’s product strategy was shaped by insights on how their audience segmented. Spotify knew that they essentially had two main types of users. Those that knew the music they wanted to listen to, which they referred to as “lean-forward” listeners.  And those that didn’t really know the artists or the albums and they just wanted the service to help them discover music that they would love, which they referred to as “lean-back” listeners.\nFor a long time Spotify had thought that the service was already pretty good for discovering music. All you needed was a good search bar and a playlisting tool. How hard can it be? \nPretty hard, it turned out, for the many mainstream “lean-back” users who didn’t have the time, or the knowledge, that the early adopters and Spotify-employed music nerds had.\nAnother strategic insight was that more and more users were discovering music through what Spotify called Moments, such as “studying”, “running”, or “dinner-party”, rather than by seeking out specific genres or artists.\nSpotify had already started a shift from the model where the user does the work by following people and playlists to build their music library, to a recommendations-based model, where the service does the work based on what the user has listened to in the past. \nRealizing that recommendations needed to become a core part of the product strategy, Spotify had recently acquired Massachusetts-based start-up The Echo Nest. The former Echo Nest engineers were now working together with Spotify’s machine learning engineers to help improve recommendations-based music discovery.\nSo Spotify leadership gathered up their product teams and explained that they needed to focus on understanding why the service was not performing as well as it should in the lean-back use case, and try to solve this.\nThis focus meant saying no to many other potential opportunities, and postponing or discontinuing others.  For example, they shut down a big initiative around video streaming, and the people and resources were reallocated to focus instead on the lean-back listener problem.\nThis holistic view of the business and the resulting focus allows the product teams to dedicate their energy to the most critical problems to solve, giving it a higher likelihood of success.\nHow You Solve Problems – Product Discovery\nInitially Spotify had a recommendations approach called Discover which presented album suggestions in a Netflix-style layout, based on the user’s personal listening history, but this seemed to demand too much interaction from the users, who expressed the desire to “get me going quick without putting in effort.”\nAt the same time, Spotify’s new Browse feature, which became the app’s new starting view and showcased hand-curated playlists like Your Favorite Coffeehouse by Spotify’s editorial team, was experiencing significantly higher user engagement compared to the Discover feature.\nOn top of that, certain industry pundits argued that lean-back users simply weren’t interested in exploring new music.\nHowever, a couple of the machine learning engineers that were working on recommendations didn’t believe this to be true. They believed there must be a way to reduce the friction for users, and help them sift through the 30 million songs to find great recommendations. \nTheir optimism was bolstered by a recent hack week project, called Play It Forward, that was an add on to Spotify’s popular Year In Music (now known as Wrapped), a feature that provided a summary of the user’s year on Spotify.\nPlay It Forward analyzed the users’ listening history, using the same algorithm as Discover, to create a playlist of music you had not yet listened to on Spotify, but that you probably would like.\nThe playlist was presented to users at the conclusion of their Year In Music review. Months later, the engineers were astonished to find that millions of users remained engaged with it. \nThis sparked a thought: what if we could create a playlist like this, and just update it more frequently? This was the seed of the idea that would become known as Discover Weekly.\nThe concept was fairly straightforward, and could potentially leverage existing technology. The feature categorized your listening history into micro-genres. It then used collaborative filtering on billions of user-created playlists, identifying those users who, just like you, listened to x also listened to y—a track you’ve yet to discover on Spotify.\nThe engineers pitched the idea to the product manager and product designer and they began the cross-functional collaboration between product, design, and engineering to evaluate the potential product risks.\nFirst up was value risk: would users choose to use it? And most importantly, if they did use it, would they find enough value to continue to use it? \nNext up was usability risk: could users figure out how to use it? Would they be able to easily find the feature and understand its benefits? Realize that Spotify had never before made a playlist for users, and just dumped it in their library before – how would people respond to this?\nNext was feasibility risk: could the engineers leverage existing systems for this, or would they need to build new systems, likely at high cost? Senior engineers at Spotify had already warned the team that what they were planning likely wouldn’t scale, as the playlist system wasn’t built to handle that kind of usage.\nFinally, would this be viable for Spotify’s business? It had only been a few months since Apple Music placed U2’s new album, “Songs of Innocence,” in every user’s library without their consent, leading to significant backlash, and forcing Apple to create a specialized tool for its removal. Concerns loomed about a similar overstep, and Spotify’s co-founder CEO, Daniel Ek, explicitly pointed out to the team that this idea could backfire.\nAfter considering all the risks, the product team decided this idea had the potential to meaningfully address the problem of the lean-back users, so they decided it was worth running a series of experiments and collecting some concrete data. The team had clear metrics to steer them toward tangible business outcomes: enhancing reach, depth, and retention. \nThe team began quietly experimenting with a live-data prototype, which they subtly rolled out to all employees without any formal announcement. Monitoring the metrics, they observed the feature’s viral spread among their colleagues. This initial response served as an early indication that, at the very least, experienced users would be able to find and use Discover Weekly. \nThis gave the team enough confidence to do a proper employee release (affectionately known as “dogfooding” in many product companies), announcing it via email, and other internal communications channels, along with an appeal to try it out, and give qualitative feedback.\nSpotify employees loved the new feature. “It’s as if my secret music twin put it together! everything in it is good!” \nWhile encouraging, the product team understood that Spotify’s employees were not a predictive test, especially for the lean-back case.  But now they had the confidence to try to answer the question of whether actual users would feel the same? \nAs with other product model companies, at Spotify, any empowered product team can roll out experiments to up to 5% of users without needing permission. The team decided to roll it out to 1.5% (1,000,000 users), watching closely as data began to trickle in.\nThe primary metrics were performing extremely well, and the qualitative results were equally impressive. The feature invited users to rate the new capability, and offer open-ended feedback. Over 1500 survey responses poured in, with more than 85% rating it 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale, and only a scant few raised the consent issue that had been a prior concern because of the Apple Music U2 reaction.\nRemarkably, 65% of respondents discovered “a new favorite song” in their personalized weekly playlist. Users also took to Twitter to praise their new favorite feature, with comments like, “It’s scary how well Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlists know me.”\nThe product discovery experiments thus far successfully mitigated the risks related to viability, usability, and value.  But feasibility was still a question.\nThe team wanted to expand Discover Weekly to a broader user base. However, as the user count swelled, it became clear that the existing playlist system would not scale, just as the senior Spotify engineers had predicted.  The playlist system was simply not equipped to handle simultaneous updates for 75 million users’ playlists. \nBut now Spotify had the evidence they needed to show that reconstructing the playlist system to accommodate the requisite scale would be worth the investment (this is what we refer to as a high-integrity business case).\nHow You Build – Product Delivery\nIn 2006, at the dawn of Spotify, the standard Waterfall approach for software product development involved months of coding, predominantly guided by internal stakeholders, before releasing your product to the world.\nAn obvious drawback of this approach was the scant user feedback until the end of the project, resulting in a product reflective more of the internal stakeholder’s preferences, with the optimistic hope that it would also resonate with potential customers. \nRecognizing these limitations, Spotify’s leaders and product teams understood early in the journey that a better approach to discovering and delivering product was necessary. \nConsequently, substantial investments were made to support the necessary experimentation and provide the product teams access to crucial user behavior data.  This included the infrastructure for instrumentation, telemetry, monitoring and reporting.  The company also invested heavily in deployment infrastructure, especially for A/B testing, with a dedicated platform product team focused on enabling these live-data tests.\nSpotify was also an early advocate of small, frequent, uncoupled releases, and invested in the tools and techniques of continuous delivery.  \nSince Spotify’s skills in product delivery are fairly well known in the industry, we won’t spend much time on that here.  However, it is critical to realize that these investments are what enable Spotify’s empowered product teams to deliver outcomes, and not just output.  \nThis delivery infrastructure paved the way for Discover Weekly and countless other Spotify innovations, large and small.\nThe Results\nOnly a few months later, Discover Weekly was ready for its global debut, rolling out to all Spotify users.\nThe launch was a resounding success, with 1 billion tracks streamed within the initial 10 weeks. Remarkably, 71% of listeners added at least one song to their personal playlists, and 60% of those who tried Discover Weekly proceeded to stream five or more tracks. \nThe online buzz was equally enthusiastic, with users sharing emotional reactions like, “got really excited and started crying a little because I realized tomorrow is Monday, and Spotify is making me a new Discover Weekly.”\nProduct Teams and Product Culture\nHopefully this slice through product work at Spotify helps make clear the power of strong product teams, led by strong product leaders, working in the product model.\nWhile Spotify is well known for its empowered product teams, this example shows what that concept really means in practice.  It requires strong product leaders that provide the strategic context – especially the hard product strategy decisions – and know how to set up the environment necessary for product teams to do good work.\nThe co-founder Daniel believed in a structure where responsibility for business outcomes, aligned with a clear understanding of product strategy, using data-informed experimentation, would produce the best results—even if the ideas weren’t his own.\nOne of the reasons that this Discover Weekly example is so illustrative is because Daniel was openly skeptical about the product idea, and shared his concerns with the product team.  But to his credit, he gave the team a problem to solve, and then allowed that work to proceed.  \nAnd to the credit of the product team, they saw the potential of the enabling technology, and they proceeded to tackle the product risks responsibly and effectively. This is what’s behind so many tech-powered innovations, and this is what is truly meant by empowered product teams.\nLike other product model companies, Spotify recognizes that the most innovative ideas—those that truly resonate with customers—often originate from those who engage with the enabling technology daily – the engineers. They are uniquely positioned to identify emerging possibilities. \nGreat leaders understand the necessity of creating an environment where empowered product teams can exercise their creativity, discovering and delivering innovative solutions that not only customers love, but also drive business success.\nLearning More\nLast year, at the invitation of Crisp, I did a related talk aimed mainly at product and Agile coaches, trying to explain the different approaches to scaling, and why Spotify thrived while so many others failed, and you can view that talk here.\nAnd of course Joakim has spoken at length about Spotify and their culture.  Here’s one of his most popular talks, and he also teaches a course on the topic.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/product-model-at-spotify/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925800737,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Product Operating Model - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThe response to my last article announcing my work on TRANSFORMED was very encouraging, and I want to thank everyone that shared their enthusiasm for the project or sent along their questions that they hope to see addressed in the book.  \nThe feedback itself was not only a demand signal, but there were some really interesting perspectives that I had not encountered before.  More about those in an upcoming article.  \nBut one thing this new book is doing, is forcing me to come up with a term for what it is that companies are transforming to. I’ve written earlier about what it means to transform, but I have not named the destination.\nUnfortunately the tech industry is not great when it comes to standardization of terms.  We often have different terms for the same concept, or different definitions of the same term.\nI am not anxious to introduce new nomenclature, but I do need to be clear on what I mean when I talk about important concepts in this book.\nWhat I’m really referring to here is simply how the best tech-powered companies work.  \nThere are a set of principles, practices and competencies that together represent this way of working.  \nInside the strong companies themselves they usually simply refer to this “as their way of working” such as the Amazon way, the Apple Model, the Netflix way, the Stripe way, or the Spotify Model, but my work is all about teasing out the common principles and practices.\nIn my writing thus far, I’ve mostly tried to avoid naming this way of working, and you can see that when I refer to “the best vs. the rest” or simply refer to the types of product teams with “product vs feature teams”.\nSome companies refer to this way of working as the “product operating model” and some refer to it as a “product-led company”.\nI’m not crazy about “product-led company” or the related “product-driven company” because too many people think that means “product-management-led company” which of course it is not.\nI’ve found in my early writing on TRANSFORMED that the most natural term seems to be simply: “product operating model” or “product model.”\nI’m tentatively hoping to go with that term, although this article is a way of testing if that’s a good idea.  \nA tougher concept to name is what the other models are – the model you are transforming from.\nIn many companies, you’ll hear constant references to “the business” in terms of making requests, and they’re running what is commonly referred to as the “IT model” (as in, “IT is there to serve the business”).  \nA close cousin of the IT model is “the project model,” where the CFO plays an outsized role because funding and staffing is typically project-based.\nIf it’s general stakeholders, then it may be “the feature-team model” (because each stakeholder drives their roadmap of features).\nIf it’s sales driving, then you’ll hear “sales-driven product,” and if it’s marketing driving, you’ll hear “marketing-driven product.”  \nEvery once in a while you’ll find a company claiming to be “engineering-driven” or “design-driven” but in these cases, it is much easier to transform the company to the product model as they already have so many of the key ingredients in place.\nFor the purposes of the book, I’m tentatively intending to refer to whatever model you are coming from as simply the “prior model,” and I’ll refer to the model you’re working to transform to as the “product operating model,” or “product model” for short.\nThere are quite a few other important product terms and concepts that I’ll be using in the book, but I’ll be defining those in the chapters and articles where I discuss them.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-product-operating-model/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925839421,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Role of Domain Experience - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThis week a friend called to ask my opinion of a product management leader – I’ll call him David – whom I’ve worked with in the past. The hiring manager is an exec at a large consumer internet services company. He really liked David, but his question to me was: “He’s clearly an expert at Enterprise Software, but could he succeed at our type of business?”\nI had to laugh, and I went on to explain that just over four years ago I got a similar call about David. His future manager was telling me that “clearly the guy was great at Infrastructure Software, but could he handle Enterprise Software?”\nIn truth, David is not an Infrastructure guy, or an Enterprise guy, or a Consumer Services guy. His education wasn’t even in technology – he studied Finance. He is, however, a very smart guy, and one of the best product managers I know. One of the things that David does extremely well is that he can tackle new domains and new technologies very quickly, and this has allowed him to excel with several very different types of products.\nI’m often asked about the need for applicable domain expertise for product managers. Many product managers, in fact, are hired exclusively for their domain experience. I do think there are a few products where domain expertise is truly essential – if I ever need a defibrillator one day, I hope there was a product manager that knew something about cardiac care. But in my experience, this is by far the exception rather than the rule.\nI’ll even go further. It can be dangerous for a product manager to have too much domain expertise. I say that because people that have spent a long time building their mastery of one domain often fall into another common product management trap – they believe that they can speak for the target customer, and that they are more like their target customer than they really are. The product manager needs to constantly revisit assumptions about the domain and the customers. It’s not impossible for people with deep domain expertise to do this, but they have to work harder at it.\nThis is not to say that you don’t need domain expertise in order to do a good job with your product – in fact I think understanding your product domain is absolutely essential. And I don’t mean superficial knowledge either. But I believe that strong product managers can come up to speed on most new product domains very quickly if they approach the education process aggressively. I’ve learned that it generally takes me 1-3 months to come up to speed on a domain I haven’t worked on before, to the point where I feel confident charting a product strategy. Some people can probably learn faster, and others might take a little longer.\nI also believe that there are some different skills required for leading enterprise products, versus infrastructure, versus consumer services versus consumer electronics. For example, if your product is sold to a relatively small number of large enterprises (as opposed to hundreds of thousands or millions of consumers), then there are some different techniques used to understand requirements and try out product ideas. It is also important to understand the different types of sales and distribution channels because these impact the product as well. If hardware is involved, you need to understand the process and timeline differences. For large scale consumer services, the issues of scale and community management can destroy you if you don’t know how to manage them.\nBut overall, I consider about 80% of the skills and talents of a product manager to be applicable across the different types of products. (My white paper “Behind Every Great Product” goes into considerable detail on the common requirements for a strong product manager).\nThis is also not a statement against the value of experience in general, but the most valuable experience is not what you learn about some product domain or technology that is probably obsolete now anyway, but rather what you’ve learned about the process of creating great products, leading a product team, managing growth, and what you’ve learned about yourself and how to improve the next time.\nVery related to domain expertise is the topic of technology expertise. This used to come up more frequently than it does now, but I still hear it. I saw a description the other day for a product manager for an enterprise application company looking for direct experience creating Linux-based products. While it’s true that there are some important differences between operating systems, if the product manager can’t very quickly grok the important points as it impacts his product then this person has much greater issues than just lacking Linux expertise.\nWith technology, it’s all about how quickly you can learn new technologies, and most importantly, envision how you can apply the new technology to the problems you are trying to solve.\nTechnologies change so fast that product managers must be skilled at quickly learning new technologies and solving problems in new domains. When I interview prospective product managers, I’m looking not to see exactly what they already know, but for each of their products, what did they need to learn, how long did it take them, and how did they apply that knowledge?\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-role-of-domain-experience/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925962605,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Supermarket of Software - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nConsider your neighborhood supermarket. When you walk in, you see somewhere between 40,000 – 50,000 products. How do you decide which to buy? Do you buy products you already know? How often do you buy something you haven’t tried before or substitute a product with something new?\nIn tech, we’re asking people to shop in a virtual supermarket of software that’s more like 100x the size. Most of what they see they don’t know, and one category alone can occupy 20% of the shelf-space. \nFor example, the most recent annual martech report featured 9,932 solutions. That’s nearly as many solutions in that one category as there are cities on the entire planet! Do you build an app? Between the iOS and Android ecosystems, there are 5.5 million of them. That’s as many people as there are in the city of Miami. Even if you live in Miami, how many people do you actually know?\nThis is simply too much for mere mortals. And yet, we keep building more products, expecting if we build it, they will come. \nThose days are long gone. And while product marketing is the foundational work that helps clarify what a product does and why someone should care, there is simply not enough product marketing talent in the world to do all the product marketing required. If you’re building a product, you must also think of go-to-market as you build. You’re connecting your product’s value to how the market already works.\nSVPG has long argued that understanding product value (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it) is the most challenging to de-risk. Yet I continue to see far too many products that are usable, feasible, reasonable for a business, and have value to some customers, but don’t reach their true market potential. It’s because the standard defining value simply isn’t high enough to stand out in the supermarket of software.\nFor any product to reach its adoption and commercial potential, its value must be exceptional enough to displace an existing product, behavior or belief. It must do so for customers who can also help grow your business. Figuring this out is an iterative, dynamic process in which every product leader must be a partner and ask “what can we do better to enable evangelistic product adoption?”\nYou might have six areas of product value, but message only one. Not because the other five areas don’t add value, but simply because if you message all six, the most convincing area of value gets lost or diminished.\nYou might ditch the technical terms describing what you do and make it more “human readable”–even if you’re marketing to a really technical crowd. What a term means to those with deep category knowledge versus what it means to those dealing with the problem every day might be different enough that they don’t realize what you have to say applies to them. \nYou might prioritize one set of features over another because it helps engender word-of-mouth or is better at convincing customers they should upgrade. This might translate to investing more heavily in using the product itself to grow adoption. Or even just packaging products differently.\nEach one of these real-life examples is a classic product marketing challenge, but it was a product team that discovered a meaningful insight in their discovery work that had go-to-market implications. It was then worked on together with product marketing to decide what marketing actions should be taken as a result. This is the collaborative building of a product’s go-to-market. \nStrong product marketing is always an outcome of a deep collaboration between product, marketing and sales. That said, in many companies, the product team takes the lead – either because of resource constraints, lack of product knowledge, or because they’re furthest forward in discovery work when it comes to new solutions.\nYet every product leader I know already has more on their plate than they know how to do. Don’t think of product marketing work as “in addition to.” Rather, it is a way to frame the work you’re already doing so you learn and benefit from more market signal as you build. This in turn, makes product marketing stronger which helps accelerate product adoption.\nThe four fundamentals of product marketing frame what must be learned and done–whether it comes from the product or marketing side. I will explore each in subsequent articles and excerpts from LOVED. But for now, here is a primer on how to think about how they apply to product teams’ work.\nAmbassador. Connect the market and customer insights. If all you do is ask at every prioritization meeting “what’s some market wind that could be at our back?” or “will this make customers wildly evangelistic?” you’ll be connecting your product to market realities in a more meaningful way.\nStrategist. Direct your product’s go-to-market. Healthy product adoption comes from making every market-facing action count. This includes deciding on go-to-market models and what mix works best for your business. How much is product-led versus product sales-assisted versus done by a direct sales force?\nStoryteller. Shape how the world thinks about your product. Based on how you’re positioning your product you may decide to prioritize what you build differently. This can be powerful in shaping a product’s perception.\nEvangelist. Enable others to tell the story. What others say matters more than ‘official’ marketing and in the product world, this includes what your product does. What converts a casual user into an engaged, repeat user or has them bring in a colleague or friend? \nIf nothing else, consider how these four fundamentals should reframe some of what you already do. It will make your product more market-ready from the start and help it stand out in the supermarket of software.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-supermarket-of-software/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925878339,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Transformation Series - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tSeptember 17, 2022\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nWe are working on the next book in the SVPG series called TRANSFORMED.  It addresses the very difficult but critical topic of how a company can transform from the rest to the best.\nAs you may know, we often test out ideas and topics by publishing articles, and those topics that prove useful make their way into our books.\nThis page is meant to list the various transformation-related articles we’ve published.  We will continue to update this page as we publish additional articles.\nTransformation Fundamentals:\nTransformation Defined: What does transformation really mean?  What can a company that has transformed do now, that they could not do before?\nChanging How You Build: What is meant exactly by changing how you build?\nChanging How You Solve Problems: What is meant exactly by changing how you solve problems?\nChanging How You Decide Which Problems To Solve:  What is the role of product strategy and product leadership?\nProduct Operating Model Overview:\nProduct Model Competencies: The four critical product model competencies.\nProduct Model Concepts: The five core product model concepts.\nTransformation Strategies:\nTransformation in Action: What does a product organization look like that has successfully transformed?\nKeys to Successful Transformation: What are the keys to a successful transformation?  \nMeaningful Transformation: How do we get started on our transformation journey?\nWorking With Key Constituencies:\nPledge To Customers: How does a company’s interactions with customers need to change when moving from sales-drive feature teams to empowered product teams?\nPledge To Stakeholders: How does the product organization interact with key stakeholders in the product model?\nPledge To Executives: How does the product organization interact with executives in the product model?\nTransformation Assistance:\nTypes of Product Coaches: What are the different types of coaches that can help us on our transformation journey?\nTransformation Pitfalls:\nScaling With Process vs People: The problem with attempting to scale and transform with process instead of people.\nProcess People: Be careful of the disease of process people.\nBooks to Help Inspire An Organization To Transform:\nProducts and People: Build by Tony Fadell\nLead with Context not Control: No Rules Rules by Reed Hastings\nLearning More:\nIf there are specific transformation topics you’d like to see addressed, or comments or feedback on any of the articles listed above, please feel free to send along your thoughts to Marty. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Operating Model\n\tFebruary 27, 2024\n\tLea Hickman\n\t\n\t\n\tTransformation Theater\n\t\n\tBy Lea Hickman and Marty Cagan Recently we’ve been writing about two very common and very problematic forms of theater:...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Leadership\n\tFebruary 13, 2024\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Leadership Theater\n\t\n\tThe previous article on Product Management Theater proved to be quite popular, and I’m grateful for all the positive feedback.  ...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Management\n\tJanuary 30, 2024\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Management Theater\n\t\n\tFair warning that for many of you, this article is going to feel like a heavy dose of tough love....\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/transformation-series/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925833904,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"The Waterfall Product Development Process - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn the last newsletter we discussed the Agile Development Processes, and the implications for product managers. In this newsletter we look at the process that the majority of product teams still follow, which is known as the “Waterfall” process.\nEven though the Waterfall development process is more than 30 years old, and even though it is often cursed by engineers and product managers alike, it is still by far the most common process used to create software products.\nNote that it has long been unfashionable for a team to describe their product development process as “waterfall” yet in most cases that is essentially what is still being followed, albeit by many different names including Successive Refinement, SDLC, Phase-Gate, Stage Review, Staged Contracts, and Milestone-based.\nIn this article we’ll try to capture the strengths as well as the key weaknesses of this approach, and discuss what the product manager can and should do in order to maximize the chance of success with this process.\nGeneral Principles\nThe conventional waterfall process is extremely simple in concept:\n1) Phased Development – the model is that the software progresses through a well-defined series of phases beginning with a written description of the requirements, into first high-level architectural design, and then to low-level detailed design, then to code, then testing, and finally deployment.\n2) Phase Review – each phase ends with a review of the deliverables from that phase, followed by sign-off and an explicit transition to the next phase.\nThe Waterfall method can be applied either very informally or very formally, as in the US Department of Defense Standard 2167A (and later 498), which describes in excruciating detail every step of the process and the many document deliverables.\nSimilarly, the waterfall method is also at the heart of the very informal and much more common scenario where someone from the marketing department gathers some market requirements and delivers them to engineering, where they come up with a schedule, and work on an architectural design and then some detailed designs for the more complicated areas, and then move into implementation and testing, often a beta, and finally deployment.\nWhile we will soon discuss the most serious limitations of this approach, it is also useful to acknowledge the key traits that have kept this process in use for so long:\n– Management appreciates the (perceived) predictability of the process. It is possible, although not common, to come up with fairly accurate schedules for even large and complex software projects. This assumes however that you completely and accurately understand the requirements and the technology, and that there will not be changes. With iterative approaches you don’t really know how many iterations will be required, which can be disconcerting to management.\n– There are deliverables throughout the process. Many people (managers, customers/clients, and even many engineers) are reassured by seeing well thought out and thorough documents and design diagrams. It helps these people to gauge progress towards the end, and also helps them feel better about the level of thinking that has gone into the project (even though there is no way to test whether or not the confidence is justified because unlike software you can’t execute paper documents). Many people make the mistake of feeling unjustifiably reassured by impressive specifications and documents.\nProduct Management Concerns\nThere are a number of well-known concerns with this process, especially from the product manager’s perspective:\n– PM Issue: Validation Occurs Too Late in Process\nThe most costly issue is that there is no actual working software until nearly the end of the process, so there is little if any visibility into whether the software will be useful until after the majority of the investment has been made.\nThe product manager must ensure that prior to moving into the design and implementation phases, the product must be prototyped and tested on actual target users, so that the specification that is eventually provided to the product development organization is describing a product that has been successfully validated with the target audience.\nLikewise, if there are major technical risks, these too should be explored and feasibility questions resolved (by the engineering organization) prior to beginning the actual architectural design and implementation. Before proceeding, the team needs to know that the product specification is something that can be successfully delivered.\n– PM Issue: Changes are Costly and Disruptive\nAny change to decisions from previous stages destabilizes the process and causes considerable pain and cost, as much work has to be reviewed and reworked. Moreover, the coding and testing process often uncovers issues in requirements and in architecture that can cause major delays and pain in this process.\nThe product manager must constantly represent the voice of the customer and user and there will be times when changes are required. It is important to point out that the cost of postponing the change needs to include the cost of the follow-on release to make the correction. There will still be times when it makes the most sense to defer the change until the next release, but in many cases it will be much less expensive to course correct sooner rather than later.\n– PM Issue: Responding to the Market\nThis approach has a relatively high overhead in terms of documentation and process for moving through the phases. One consequence of this is that it can take considerable time to make even relatively small changes to the software.\nThis puts additional pressure on the product manager to ensure that they are providing a validated specification for a successful product in the first place, but it also means that the product manager will need to work with the product team to make course corrections after release as quickly as possible.\nSummary\nWe have all seen the consequences of the Waterfall process in practice, and it’s not hard to understand the motivation for alternatives such as the Agile methods like XP we discussed previously.\nIn many ways, the Waterfall process represents an idealistic but naïve view of the software development process, where people are able to anticipate the key issues and fully understand the requirements. When this is the case — usually for very small projects — this approach can provide a reasonable path to a quality implementation.\nUnfortunately, this is rarely the case with product software. In practice, the consequence is that the product ships later than planned due to changes, and then expensive, time-consuming follow-on releases are required in order to correct issues once real users have a chance to see and use the actual software.\nHowever, the product development process is often deeply entrenched in the product development organization, and the product manager must take steps to ensure that the potential problems are avoided. The most important key is to ensure the product spec is validated prior to moving to the implementation phase (remember to cover all three types of validation as described in “How To Write a Good PRD“), and you can save your team significant time and cost.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/the-waterfall-product-development-process/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925882793,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Time To Build - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy now everyone that reads these articles is aware that our industry has entered yet another one of its down cycles.  \nMost of the companies I know of and work with have had at least some level of staff reduction, and have worked to bring down their spend.  \nSome have a sizable war chest because they raised funds when it was easy, and were conservative about their spending.  Many weren’t so careful about their spending, and some are in real trouble.\nThe good news is that there are still lots of good jobs out there for those that find themselves suddenly without one.  But many people are naturally stressed from the change, especially those that had to leave a company and a manager they felt fortunate to work for.\nBut apart from the lives that have been disrupted, I can’t help but observe after so many years in the industry, and witnessing so many of these cycles, that very often the best products come from companies during these down periods.\nOthers have observed this too.  Much harder of course is understanding the reason.\nMore than a few CEO’s over the years have told me that “the easiest problems are the ones they can solve with a check.”  I don’t know if that’s something taught in business school or something, but that statement has always rubbed me the wrong way.  \nMy personal theory is that this belief contributes to many failed product companies.  \nIt’s not that they necessarily have too much money, but the lack of financial constraints means that they sometimes believe they can overcome the difficult problems (especially that pesky problem of getting to product/market fit) by spending heavily on sales, marketing, customer success, and the one that bothers me most of all, acquisitions (more about why acquisitions so often go so very wrong in an upcoming article).\nOf course there are some businesses which are focused on unit economics from very early on, and in this case extra spending doesn’t do too much to obscure the underlying reality of the situation.\nBut as most of you hopefully know, there are a great many business strategies in our industry that legitimately defer their focus on profitability.  Many of the best products in the world wouldn’t exist without leaders that understood the benefits of this strategy.\nBut I’m suggesting that too often that excuse is used to mask the underlying reality that the product is not where it needs to be.\nIn any case, when the money dries up, the product deficiencies become plain to see.  And that’s precisely where many companies find themselves today.\nWhen the product is inadequate, it makes marketing difficult and costly, it makes sales not only slow and expensive, but the sales organization is too often forced to do unnatural acts that rarely end well, and the poor people in so-called customer success are more accurately punching bags for unhappy customers.\nWhich is why, with a nod to Marc Andresseen’s 2020 essay It’s Time To Build, I am encouraging all of these companies that do not yet have the products they need to sustain their business, to focus their energies on building.\nThis means focusing on the core competencies of figuring out what precisely you need to build (product discovery), and getting that product to market (product delivery).\nSince many of these companies have not a single dollar or day to waste, I want to remind them that what’s hard about product is not so much figuring out what problem to solve, but rather, coming up with a solution that is demonstrably better than the alternatives, that users and customers will switch to your offering.\nOnce you have established product/market fit, then by all means invest in marketing, sales, and customer success.  But I promise you that you’ll find those investments producing a much greater return for you.  And most importantly, you will finally have happy customers.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/time-to-build/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925831388,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Titles, Roles and Responsibilities - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThe more I discuss the role of product management with people the more I run into confusion about titles. The title “Product Manager” can mean very different things to different people, depending on the industry they’re from or even the particular company they work at. To me this is a sign of how new the high-tech product development field still is.\nI don’t expect standardized titles and roles any time soon, but what we can do is to break the function down to key responsibilities that everyone can understand, and then discuss which functions are included when we refer to “Product Manager.” I’ve tried this out a few times now and have found this useful, so I’ll present it here:\nOpportunity Identification and Assessment\nThis refers to coming up with new product ideas, and then assessing them. Typically the new ideas can come from anywhere – discussions with customers, usability testing, your own product team, your sales or marketing staff, industry analysts – virtually anywhere. But then someone needs to take a hard look at the idea and decide if it is something worth pursuing. I consider this “opportunity assessment” role as something that the product manager should at least participate in if not be responsible for. Many companies write up this opportunity assessment into an MRD (Market Requirements Document) but I like to think of these as Opportunity Assessments which I consider as broader than just the market requirements.\nProduct Specification\nNow that you’ve decided that there is a good opportunity and your company is well-suited to pursue it, then someone needs to figure out what the solution actually is – the product – the necessary features and functionality, the user experience, the release criteria and the required timeframe. I view this as the heart of the product manager’s job. Some companies call this spec a Product Requirements Document (PRD), and others call it a Product Spec or Functional Spec. The key is that it describes the functionality and behavior of the product to be built, and not how it will be implemented.\nProduct Design\nA good product spec should fully describe the user experience, which means that the product designer (also know as interaction designer, UI designer, information architect, or human factors engineer) needs to be a partner in defining the product and creating the spec. Most product teams have professional product designers, but sometimes the product manager is the only one available to come up with the interaction design.\nProject Management\nOnce the product has been defined, the product development team will begin building the product. The project scheduling and tracking function is the core of project management. There are several different models regarding who does this project scheduling and tracking. Sometimes it is managed by dedicated project managers, and sometimes by the engineering manager (since most of the resources are usually from his or her team), and in some cases the product manager is asked to project manage. In my experience, any of these can work – it depends more on the culture of the company and the size of the project. Larger projects definitely benefit from a dedicated (and skilled) project manager.\nProduct Marketing\nOnce the product is ready, you will need to tell the world about that product. This outbound messaging is a key marketing function. Often companies ask the same person to do the product management (product definition) and the product marketing. This can be hard since the skills required are so very different, but in many companies this is nevertheless the case.\nIn my view, the defining responsibility for product managers is in specifying the product. If that is included, I consider the position true product management. Any of the other roles – opportunity assessment, product design, project management, or product marketing – may also be included, but the heart of the product management position is in defining the product that addresses the opportunity.\nSide Note: At Microsoft, the people that come up with the specs and drive the project schedule are called “Program Managers,” which is an unfortunate title given that the term is used in the industry already to describe project management which spans multiple projects. But they couldn’t really use the term “product manager” either because they already use that to represent the product marketing function. While I wish they used different titles (for both), in general I think they do a very good job on the critical product management role of defining

my normal areas of focus, and the article caused a considerable stir, with more than an order of magnitude more dialog via Twitter, LinkedIn and direct e-mails to me than I typically receive from my writing.\nMost importantly, the article seemed to help people to think more about the relationship between the product development process and the culture and mindset of the organization.\nThis article is not about that particular process, or really any particular tool or process.\nThe reason for this article is that several people tried to argue that any process or tool can be used for good or for bad, and you can’t really blame the tool or process. \nMoreover, several people pointed out that I’ve argued for many years that what’s most important is not the process but rather the culture, so why even waste the ink complaining about a process?\nThese two related points are extremely important to product teams, and I wanted to address them both, because I think these points undermine the efforts of many teams.\nOne of the things that makes this challenging is that there’s lots of different tools, methods and processes out there.  Even if we keep the focus at tech product teams, we have tools for product managers, tools for designers and tools for engineers.  We have processes and tools for managing objectives, managing roadmaps, managing projects, managing issues and of course managing the code and data that we use to build, deploy and run our products.\nIn my career, I have personally worked on tools and processes in all of these areas.  I spent the first decade of my career as an engineer building tools for mainly engineering teams – some of these tools were straightforward, mostly agnostic tools like debuggers and source code analyzers, and some were much more intertwined with how the team works – like software configuration management and change management systems.  Later the tools were more about underlying Internet infrastructure and scale.\nBut the common denominator in my career has been tools and methods for product development teams.  I still love the tools, methods and product development process space, but that doesn’t mean that I love all tools, methods and product development processes.\nThe key is to realize that every tool, method or process is trying to help the intended user to do certain things more easily, and they usually also intentionally make it difficult to other things.\nAs an example, an area of active tool development right now is the OKR space.  Now if you’re not interested in OKR’s then you wouldn’t want or need a tool, but if you are, then you may be considering one of the several tools available.\nThere are a number of principles behind the OKR technique and methodology – mainly around empowerment, alignment, transparency, and a focus on results.  Just to focus on one of these for a moment, to support the principle of transparency, the tools make it much easier to search to see if any other product team anywhere in your company might be working on a specific objective.  And most of the tools actually make it hard to not be transparent.  To me this is a good thing.  But to others, especially those that hold different views on leadership and empowerment, this might not be what they want.\nAnother example would be product roadmap tools.  As with OKR’s, there are a range of tools out there, and some have better user experiences and some have features for larger teams and organizations, but the deeper issues have to do with what the creators believe makes a “good” roadmap. \nI have seen several tools that are designed to make it easy to tally the requests from different stakeholders and from different customers or prospective customers, so that the product manager can make a “data-driven” decision on what the priority of the requested features should be.\nIf that’s how you want to determine what your team will work on, then these types of roadmap tools are helping you towards that end.  However, if you believe as I do that this is exactly the wrong approach to coming up with winning products, then a team forced to use a tool like this will have to fight the tool in order to try to do good work.\nI’ve just highlighted a couple examples from the product management tool space, but I could just as easily use examples from design or engineering.\nThe reason product development process is often such a religious topic is because that typically impacts everyone on the team, usually in fairly fundamental ways.\nWhen teams first moved to Agile methods like Scrum, most had to dramatically accelerate their release cadence (e.g. from releasing quarterly to releasing every two weeks). \nThat’s a pretty significant change, impacting release planning, design, engineering, quality assurance, deployment, product marketing, and more.  If you believe, as I do, that frequent small releases is much better for us and for our customers than big bang releases, then this is a good thing.  If you don’t, then you probably just circumvented the process by doing what many companies did – which is to just do a little QA each sprint, but only actually release to customers every 5 or 6 sprints.\nYou can hopefully start to see how these various choices either support cultural values or work against them.  With just the examples I used here, these choices impact team empowerment, transparency, innovation, and the importance of product quality and reliability.\nEvery product development process is predicated on some beliefs about teams and leadership and how to create value.  But you can’t go by what the tool or process vendor’s marketing material tells you. \nYou have to look closely at what behaviors and activities the tool, method or process is actively encouraging, and which they are discouraging, and you need to be sure this is aligned with what you want for your team and your organization.\nNOTE: Recently my friend Ken Norton published this excellent article on the same topic.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/tools-and-processes/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925761193,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Training Engagements -

Management Consultancies - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThere are several common anti-patterns when it comes to the reasons for failed transformation efforts.\nBut one of the most well-known, most common, and most frustrating has to do with the big management consultancies.\nEspecially since most people that have worked with these consultancies know that it’s not because their people are clueless.  In truth, most of the time the people there – at least the senior ones that you interact directly with – are well above average.\nAnd if you’ve seen what these management consultancies are charging your company, you know it’s not due to lack of investment on your company’s part.\nSo if their people are smart, and your company is willing to spend what they’re asking, what’s the problem?\nMy theory is that this anti-pattern is structural.  These firms are inherently unable to help, and transformations driven by them are almost certainly destined to fail.\nThink of it this way.\nSuppose your local power utility company wanted to move from fossil fuel powered energy to renewable energy.\nSo your power company calls up their contacts in the fossil fuel industry and ask “can you help us?”\nWhy would they do this?  Because they’ve worked together for decades.  And because of course the fossil fuel company is smart enough to position themselves as in the “energy” business.\nDo you expect the fossil fuel people to say no?  Of course they’ll say they can help.  \nBut really what you’re asking is for them to act against their own institutional interests.  And even if they were willing to do that, it’s unlikely they know how.\nTo bring this back to tech, in your existing stakeholder-driven, feature-team model of working, the stakeholders have long leaned on business consultants, but if transformation requires that this capability not only be brought in house, but also handled by different people (product leaders rather than the stakeholders), do you really expect this outside firm to be willing and able to push that change?\nStakeholders hire management consultants for help with decisions, and those consultants will not be incentivized to provide advice that diminishes the power of the people who hired them.\nThis is much the same problem as what happens with outsourcing in IT.  \nIf you’ve been outsourcing a significant percentage of your engineering to one of the outsourcing firms, but transforming requires bringing this competency in-house, do you really expect the outsourcing firm to advocate for that?  This is a direct threat to their business.\nTransforming to the product model involves changes well beyond how your stakeholders make decisions, and how you staff your product teams.  Understanding this is on you.  \nYou can’t expect your current management consulting providers or IT outsourcing firms to help eliminate your need for them.\nThat said, there are often very good people in the management consultancies and the outsourcing firms, and just because you shouldn’t hire their firms to help you transform, that doesn’t mean you can’t hire away some of their people.\nJust be sure you have someone with the necessary experience in the product model so that their minds and skills will be put to good use.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/management-consultancies/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925810150,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Transformation Defined - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Jon Moore and Marty Cagan\nThere are so many anti-patterns when it comes to transformation.  \nMany of us have witnessed failed transformations, but few have witnessed true successes.  Which makes the lessons learned from successful transformations unusually valuable.  We intend to write much more about both the anti-patterns, and the lessons from the successes.\nDefining Success\nOne question that we get quite frequently is, “what can a company that has transformed do better than a company that hasn’t?”\nSince we in the product world talk a great deal about outcomes and results, we think that’s the right question.  And we have been emphasizing the capabilities and results of those companies that have transformed, especially the ability to respond to threats and exploit new opportunities.\nBut assuming the leaders of a company believe they need to truly transform, what does that really mean?\nMany of you have heard us say things like: “transforming to Agile may be necessary, but it’s in no way sufficient.”\nOr, “the heart of transformation is moving from feature teams to empowered product teams.”\nOr, “the goal is to transform to a product-led company.”\nMoving To The Product Operating Model\nWhile each of these comments may speak to a specific aspect of transformation, they don’t give a good holistic picture of what is truly meant by transformation.\nSo, recently, we’ve begun to take a different approach.  \nInstead of applying a label (“Agile,” “Empowered Teams,” “Product-Led Company”), we find it useful to look at what is actually changing:\nChanging How You Build and Deploy\nDespite Agile being around for so many years, there are still far too many companies stuck doing quarterly (or worse), big-bang releases.  The rise of fake agile lets these companies fool themselves into thinking they’re Agile, without actually improving how they build in any meaningful way.\nOur company and our customers need us to have reliable, consistent and frequent delivery vehicles.  If you’re not doing continuous delivery, then at the very least you should be doing true releases no less than every two weeks.  Note that you don’t actually need Agile methods to do this, but moving to Agile is often the forcing function to achieve this.\nSee here for more details on changing how you build.\nChanging How You Solve Problems\nThis is the core of what is meant by moving from Feature Teams to Empowered Product Teams.\nInstead of stakeholders prioritizing their perceived solutions (features and projects) and providing these in the form of a roadmap to a feature team, now the product team is assigned problems to solve, and the product team is empowered to discover a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible and viable.\nIn practice this means developing the skills to do product discovery, and ensuring that your engineers and product designers have a true product manager (skilled in the customers, the data, the business and the industry) so that the product team has the necessary cross-functional skills to succeed.\nIt’s important to note that this change implies a new relationship with the company stakeholders; where the product team moves from a subservient relationship, to a collaborative relationship where the product team must discover a solution that the customers love yet works for the business.\nSee here for more details on changing how you solve problems.\nChanging How You Decide Which Problems To Solve\nGetting skilled at product discovery so that your teams can consistently and quickly solve hard problems in ways that your customers love yet work for your business is a significant leap forward by anyone’s definition, but it doesn’t address the question of “how did you decide this was the most important problem to be solved?”\nEvery company faces many threats and many opportunities.  Which threats you take seriously, and which opportunities you decide to pursue, can mean the difference between success and failure.\nA strong product-led company has a compelling product vision, and an insight-based product strategy to identify the most critical problems to solve in order to deliver on the business objectives.\nSee here for more details on changing how you decide which problems to solve.\nA couple of important notes:\nFirst, all three of these changes depend on strong product leaders (leaders of product management, product design, and engineering), and hopefully you can see why product leadership is hard.  The people on the product teams will require coaching and strategic context.  If your product leaders do not have the necessary skills themselves, then this is where finding a product leadership coach is key.\nSecond, it sounds intuitive to treat each of these three as steps in a progression, and indeed this would be one way to approach a company transformation, but they can in fact be pursued in parallel.  Rather than thinking of these three as a progression, we typically recommend to instead pursue all three (or whichever subset has not yet been accomplished) in parallel, but doing so with one or a few pilot teams, or a subset of the organization, and then expanding the transformation from there.\nSo to summarize:\nChanging how you build and deploy means moving from big quarterly releases to a cadence of small, consistent releases. \nChanging how you solve problems means moving from stakeholder-driven roadmaps and feature teams, to empowered product teams given problems to solve, and then using product discovery to come up with solutions that are valuable, usable, feasible and viable. \nChanging how you decide which problems to solve is typically the most profound change of all, as this drives what opportunities you choose to pursue, and how you make the most out of the investment you make, including product vision and product strategy. \nHopefully this framing can help you think more holistically about the transformation that your company may need, and where you may be on that journey.\nSpecial thanks to Chris Jones for his help with this

Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nTransformation Overview\nOne of SVPG’s most popular services is a private engagement to help companies in their transformation journey to the product operating model – whether they are new to working this way, or looking to reinforce and strengthen the practices within their organization.\nWhat is the product operating model?\nAt SVPG, we were created to share the practices of the top technology-powered product companies.  While there are differences at each of these top companies, they share common competencies, concepts, and most importantly, principles, and these are referred to as the product operating model.  Learn more here.\nWhat does it really mean to transform to the product model?\nMoving to the product model usually means changing more than you might imagine.  The transformation journey starts with understanding what it really means to transform.  Learn more here.\nWhy is transformation so hard?\nThe benefits of successful transformation are well known, but it’s also well known that it is not easy to make the necessary changes.  Why is it so hard?  Learn why here.\nCan you show us examples of companies, like ours, that have succeeded in transforming?\nWe are publishing a book that includes detailed case studies of several companies that have successfully transformed, none of which were born in the product model.  Learn more here.\nWhat is different about working with SVPG?\nOur partners have each personally led large companies through the process of transformation to a successful outcome.  We believe that this first-hand experience is absolutely critical to your success.\nWhat would an SVPG transformation engagement look like?\nSince every company is different – different size, different cultures, different stages, different types of products – the best answer to this question is to discuss your specific situation with one of the SVPG Partners. \nThat said, most of our transformation engagements involve executive briefings, stakeholder briefings, organization assessments, transformation planning, and training and coaching of product teams and product leaders.\nWhat if we’re not sure we are ready for a transformation? Is there an easy way to take the first step?\nFor many companies, they like to start with an organizational assessment, and/or an executive briefing. This is easy to do, does not cost much in terms of time or money, and then lets the company’s leadership team decide what specifically they wish to pursue, and how they would like to approach the transformation.\nHow do we get our executives on board?\nThis is why it’s so important to hold executive briefings so that the executives know what to expect, and how they can help.  But we’ve found it’s also important that this executive briefing be delivered by someone that has the necessary credibility with the senior executive team.\nHow do we explain the product model to everyone involved and impacted?\nTransformation to the product model involves significant changes across the company, not just to product and technology, but to finance, HR, marketing, business unit management, and more.  So it’s important to share the rationale for the product model, as well as provide several examples of companies that have successfully transformed, and the lessons learned.\nHow do you determine where we are on our transformation journey, and what is still necessary for us to address?\nWe start our transformation work with an organizational assessment. This involves interviews with people at every level, from CEO/GM to individual contributor product managers, designers and engineers.  This assessment helps us understand what areas are already strong, and which areas need attention.\nHow do we transform when our leaders have never worked this way before?\nWe provide executive briefings, workshops, training and books to help rapidly bring people up to speed, but beyond what we do personally, there are several additional options for ongoing help with your transformation effort.  SVPG has a global network of transformation coaches, product leadership coaches and product discovery coaches that we recommend – we have no financial relationships with any of them – but we have worked with them in the past and can vouch for their knowledge and skills.  \nWhen is the right time to get help in our transformation?\nThere is always this question of whether it is better to build the necessary organization first, and then show them a new way of operating, or to show your current organization the new way of operating, and then teach and coach your people, and recruit where necessary. Either can work, but the sooner your leaders understand what is truly ahead of them, and what the destination looks like, the sooner you can start coaching your people to success.\nI would like to discuss our specific situation with an SVPG Partner.  How can I do that?\nSchedule a conversation with an SVPG Partner to discuss your specific needs\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/transformation-engagements/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925793303,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Transformation Fail - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThe Root Causes of Failed Transformations\nIt is an open secret that the vast majority of attempted digital transformations fail.  Companies spend millions of dollars and years of effort, yet fail to make meaningful change.  The only real question is why?\nWe have been working for the past 20 years on the front lines to help companies that are serious about transforming to realize the benefits of moving to the product operating model.  Not all have been successful, but many have, and at this point we have strong opinions about what is necessary to successfully transform.\nIn this article, we’ll discuss what we consider the top 10 root causes of failed transformations.  Success starts with confronting these confusions and misunderstandings head-on.\nWe hope to give you a better understanding of why so many transformations fail, but also a deeper understanding of what is truly necessary to succeed.\n1. Underestimating Scope \nIt is very common for companies to believe that transformation is something that happens within the technology organization.  This is especially common when the company also thinks that transformation essentially means implementing Agile.  But as you’ll soon see, transformation impacts the entire organization – sales, marketing, finance, HR, legal, compliance and more.\n2. Underestimating Role of CEO \nAs mentioned earlier, transformation impacts the company far beyond the technology organization.  Too often, the CEO delegates the responsibility for transformation to a CIO, Chief Digital Officer, or Chief Transformation Officer.  But as Bill Campbell famously said, “the company cares about what the leader cares about.”  Which is why a successful transformation depends on the CEO being the “chief evangelist” of the company’s move to the product operating model.\n3. Underestimating Role of Technology \nSo many companies draw these artificial lines around what they consider physical products and what they consider digital products.  But the potential of technology is to improve all products, not just digital products.  More generally, it’s important to start thinking of technology as more than a necessary expense.  Moving to the product operating model is about turning technology from a cost center to a profit center.\n4. Underestimating the Critical Competencies\nIt is easy to give employees a new job title, but much harder to change how they think and behave.  And sometimes that new job title carries along with it expectations that existing staff may not be able to perform.  This problem is most common with product managers, but is also common with product designers and engineering tech leads.  Good products come from strong product teams, and strong product teams are made up of skilled people in these critical roles.  Without strong people on the product teams, the product operating model collapses.\n5. Misunderstanding Role of Engineering \nIt is remarkable how differently engineers are viewed at a product operating model company versus at other companies.  In many old companies this thinking is so ingrained that they follow this to the logical conclusion and they outsource their engineers, considering them a commodity.  Yet nothing could be further from the truth.  At strong product companies, engineers play a critical role in identifying the best opportunities and the best solutions.\n6. Misunderstanding Nature of Product\nThere are some fundamental differences between technology-powered products and services, and other types of products.  Steve Jobs used to refer to “the disease of thinking that an idea is 90% of the work” yet with technology the idea is just the beginning, and we understand that many (most) ideas will not deliver the hoped-for value.  Knowing what you can’t know is essential when working with technology-powered products, and this leads to an experimentation culture where we seek to quickly identify a solution that works.\n7. The Product Leadership Gap \nIf the product operating model depends on strong product teams, who is it that coaches the people on the product teams to ensure they are capable of performing their critical roles, and then have the context to make good decisions?  In so many companies trying to transform, this critical responsibility is either ignored or delegated to others.  Yet in strong product companies, this is the primary responsibility of the product leaders.  \n8. Peanut Butter Product Strategy \nTo succeed, your business needs to be sure you are pursuing the most impactful opportunities, and responding to the most serious threats.  Yet in most companies they simply allocate resources to the many stakeholders across the company in what is known as the “peanut butter product strategy” (spreading the companies resources thinly across the company).  Instead, the company needs an inspiring product vision and a holistic, insight-driven product strategy.\n9. Prioritizing Predictability Over Outcomes\nEvery company ideally wants both predictability (so they can know what is happening when) and outcomes (achieving the necessary business results).  Yet most companies do not understand the relationship between the two.  Strong product companies understand the difference between time-to-market and time-to-money.  Time-to-market is of course important, but not nearly as important as achieving the necessary business results.  In so many old companies, the technology teams do not feel empowered to achieve business outcomes, so the best they can sign up for is to deliver output.  But in a product company, predictably delivering output that does not provide the necessary business results is an empty victory.\n10. Looking For Love In All The Wrong Places \nYou are probably wondering how could so many companies be making so many fundamental mistakes?  In most cases, the reasons companies made these mistakes is because they looked for guidance from people that had never actually built products.  As surprising as this sounds, we see this problem across the industry.  This is most often the management consultancies, or the Agile coaching community.  But as with most things, it is buyer beware.  You need to be sure the people guiding you have truly been there and done that, and that they know what good looks like.  As a very explicit example, you need to make sure the people teaching your product managers have actually done product management at a product operating model company.\nMoving to the product operating model means successfully navigating each of these issues.  It’s not easy, but hopefully you have a sense of what to look out for, and where you need to get to.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/transformation-fail/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925786227,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Transformation Theater - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBy Lea Hickman and Marty Cagan\nRecently we’ve been writing about two very common and very problematic forms of theater: product management theater, and product leadership theater.\nWe’ve been intentionally trying to shine a bright light on these behaviors, as we see them at the source of so many weak product organizations, causing a great deal of frustration for all of those involved.\nIn that same spirit, there are several other forms of “theater” that pertain to efforts to transform how a company builds products.  This certainly includes the two forms we’ve already written about, but it goes much further.\nIt’s no secret that most transformation efforts fail to deliver the desired results, so in the spirit of trying to call out the problematic behaviors so that they can be recognized and addressed, we wanted to share the most common forms of theater we encounter.\nMost of these behaviors involve going through the motions, without actually changing how the people or the company operate.\nTransformation Theater\nAt the highest level, there is often theater pertaining to the transformation effort itself.  The most common symptom of this is when the organization is focusing on transformation activity, and not transformation results.\nYou might recognize the irony of this.  As transformation to the product model involves moving from output to outcomes, the problem here is that the transformation effort hides behind output (activities) rather than outcomes (results).\nRealize that outcomes are much harder to achieve, and people will revert to what they know, so one of the most common forms of theater is to showcase all the various activities – new training and new certifications, reorganizations, new ceremonies, new processes and tools – yet still doing business as usual.\nAnother possible cause is that in many companies, from the viewpoint of the many employees, the company has been “transforming” for years.  There has been one big company transformation initiative after another, usually tied to some new senior leader.  No wonder that the people suffer from change fatigue.\nIt’s also not a surprise if some people decide to wait it out, and hope that this too shall pass. Unfortunately, this behavior can create its own self-fulfilling prophecy. \nIf people are just going through the motions, this is theater and not helpful.\nTitle Theater\nVery analogous to the concept of title inflation, is the concept of title theater.\nThis is when key titles change, and often the job descriptions change, but the same people are performing the same role as before.\nThis is most damaging when it happens to the roles most critical to transforming: the product model competencies.  When product owners or business analysts are re-titled to product managers.  Or when graphic designers are re-titled to product designers.  Or when engineers are re-titled to tech leads.\nWithout people that know what good looks like, who can usefully and accurately assess the skills of the employees, and then coach the people to the necessary competence, the transformation is almost certainly doomed to fail.\nInnovation Theater\nMany organizations have largely given up hope that their product teams are capable of innovation, so they then get the idea to create a dedicated “innovation team” that is supposed to do the innovations.  \nUnfortunately, while these innovation teams often can and do discover good potential solutions, they rarely end up making it to customers.  That’s because the product teams that discover the solutions, need to be the same people that will deliver those solutions, otherwise they will very likely go nowhere.\nMoreover, culturally, this creates two classes of product people – those responsible for innovation, and those responsible for… non-innovations? \nDiscovery Theater\nMoving from feature teams to empowered product teams is at the core of changing how you solve problems, and this involves introducing real product discovery skills.  Yet it’s easy to just continue doing the design and development of new features, but now pretend this is product discovery.\nThe key is whether or not the solution generates the necessary outcome.  But you can also look at the number of ideas the product team is trying out, and if they are just designing and building all their ideas, then this is just discovery theater.  You want to see that they are discarding at least half of their ideas, and only building the ones where there is evidence the solution is worth building.\nAgile Theater\nOne of the most frustrating problems in companies that need to transform, is that in so many cases, they previously spent significant time and money on transforming to use Agile methods, yet they have little in the way of results to show for it.\nToday they may have an army of Agile coaches, Agile-specific roles, and ongoing Agile ceremonies, yet they are still releasing monthly or even quarterly, and there’s no empowerment to speak of. This is commonly referred to as Fake Agile and is one of the most obvious forms of Agile theater.\nThis is not just a development process argument.  It gets to whether the company can truly take care of its customers, and whether it believes in empowering its people.  The difference between doing agile and being agile.\nStrategy Theater\nSimilar to discovery theater and Agile theater, most companies today talk about product strategy, but for most of them it is much easier to continue to give allocations to the various stakeholders and just let them decide what they each need.  This is sometimes referred to as “peanut butter product strategy” as in spreading the resources very thinly over the company, doing many things but nothing well.\nLooking holistically across the company requires both strong and skilled product leaders, and the senior executive support to focus on the most impactful areas, and say no to countless other less meaningful distractions.\nStakeholder Collaboration Theater\nOne final form of theater that is important to call out.  \nThere’s no question that moving from stakeholder-driven roadmaps to product leadership-driven product strategy represents a shift in control, and many of the stakeholders will understandably be apprehensive about this change.\nWhat sometimes happens is that the product leaders and product managers view this change as a transfer of power from the stakeholders to them.  But what is really needed is to move to a collaborative model.  Remember that a strong product team is asked to solve problems in ways our customers love, yet work for the business.  And “work for the business” typically requires real collaboration.\nWhat sometimes happens is that the product leaders and product managers start ignoring the stakeholders, or maybe just humoring them – pretending to listen and care.\nIf the stakeholders feel they no longer have the ability to influence what the product team builds,  and if they feel like their responsibilities have been co-opted by the product teams, the transformation is headed for some very rough waters.\nIn order for stakeholders to support the product model, they need to believe there are competent people in the product teams that make a sincere effort to learn and understand the different stakeholder needs, and will respect the constraints of the business.\nTo gain that knowledge there needs to be a trust-based relationship between the product leaders in the organization and the stakeholders they partner with. \nSummary\nIt’s important to understand that none of these forms of theater are usually intentional. It is simply that changing to the product model is hard, and people most often follow the path of least resistance, which is typically to avoid change.\nBut if you are aware of these behaviors, and understand the reasons they occur, you can work to identify and address these issues early in your transformation efforts, and direct the attention to the examples where this is done well.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/transformation-theater/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925791864,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Transformed FAQ - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThis page is here to hold questions and answers that come up once the TRANSFORMED book is published and we can no longer add them to the “Objections” section of the book.\nADDITIONAL OBJECTIONS AND QUESTIONS\n“Our product managers are already so busy, how can we possibly add more responsibilities onto these people?”\nThis question is already covered in the book, but this comes up so often that we wanted to include here for people that do not buy or read the book.\nWhen transforming from a feature-team product manager to an empowered product team product manager, the job is essentially completely different. \nThe feature-team product manager job is fundamentally about project management, and as such, as with virtually every project manager, their number of meetings simply expand to cover the amount of hours available.

A lot of communication and coordination, primarily to get work through the delivery process.\nYet in an empowered product team, the job is not about delivery or project management; it is about product discovery. \nWe have long advised product managers to offload the project management to one of the project managers (whatever title your company uses for this: delivery managers, project managers, or program managers).\nWe have also long advised that it takes most product managers on the order of four hours per day to cover their product discovery responsibilities (discussed in depth in INSPIRED). And then we encourage product managers to save an additional hour a day to answer questions from the engineers that come up during their delivery work.\nBut the real point is that when moving from feature teams to empowered product teams, you are not adding responsibilities, you are changing responsibilities. This is why true product management in the sense we’re describing here is considered a new competency.\n“You say in the book that the support of the CEO/GM is essential, yet you also emphasize how much the product leaders can do to drive the transformation, and even what an individual contributor product manager can do. Are you suggesting a transformation can only succeed with an already supportive CEO/GM?”\nIn our experience, this is not a binary thing – where the CEO is either supportive or she is not. In practice, it is about progressively earning the trust of the executives. I sometimes explain this as like a multi-level game, where you start at level 1, and once you’ve shown you have achieved a certain level of skill, you are able to enter level 2, and so on. It’s very much like this. \nThe product manager or the product leader demonstrates that they can contribute towards real outcomes at one level (e.g. a product manager with her own skills, or with her product team, and a product leader with a set of product teams), and the company leaders see this progress and give them more room to have larger impact, and this continues during the transformation, until a full business unit has transformed, or until the full enterprise has transformed.\nWe consider this not only reasonable, but prudent. The CEO may be very supportive in theory, but likely can’t know if the product teams and product leaders have the skills and the motivation to successfully deliver outcomes.\n“Are you suggesting that an individual contributor can take on the responsibility of transforming a company?”\nNo, we have never said this. However, we have pointed out many times that an individual contributor has more ability to impact her work environment than most people realize. And if she does this – such as by up-leveling her skills from a product owner or feature-team product manager to an empowered team product manager – then it’s not unusual that she finds herself getting recognized and sometimes even promoted. And if she makes it to product leader, then she has much more ability to impact the broader company.\n“What about Product Ops? I don’t see this described as one of the four critical competencies. Are you suggesting that the role is unnecessary?”\nThis is also in the book, but we’re expecting many of the people that are worried about this are not likely to read the book, so let us try to clarify here: There are several quite different definitions of Product Ops we have encountered in companies around the world. In this article we summarize the six major definitions we see. If you read the article you will see that some of these definitions we find very helpful, and others range from harmless to serious anti-patterns. So a crisp answer on this is difficult because of the ambiguity out there. \nWhen the Product Ops people are helping the product teams to quickly answer questions qualitatively (primarily via user research) or quantitatively (primarily via data analysis), we find that to be very helpful. For more than two decades this has existed in strong product companies, and demonstrated real value, it was just not called “product ops.”\n“How do you define which companies are considered the best?“\nWe have long used the heuristic that the company must have demonstrated that they are capable of consistent innovation. \nWe point to companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix, Slack, Spotify, and Stripe, as well-known examples. We also note that it’s not just us that consider these companies consistently innovative. The stock market has recognized these companies as well.\nNote that this doesn’t mean that every product effort is successful. In fact, failures come along with innovation. But it does mean that the company has shown they have the skills to have multiple significant successes, even as they scale.\nThis also means that an early stage startup that may have a truly innovative first product, but has not yet shown that they can continue to innovate as they scale, would not be included (no matter how much we may love that startup).\n“Since every company is different, can you really leverage practices between companies?“\nYes, every company is different, just as every person is different. But fortunately the principles are remarkably consistent across the best companies. \nIt is true that one of the most common excuses is the classic “but we’re different,” so don’t be surprised if you encounter this argument. \nIn product, we look for “differences that make a difference.” And when it comes to the product principles underlying the product model, we find those principles in virtually every type of tech-powered product company we know, whether they are building hardware, software, for businesses or consumers, from regulated industries to entertainment. So just because every company is different in some way, does not mean that they would not benefit from learning from the best.\n“I know someone that works at one of these companies considered among the best, and he says that not every team at this company is an empowered product team, and that some are feature teams.”\nEven at the best companies we know, some teams are not truly empowered. There can be various reasons for this. In some cases, the people on the team have not yet demonstrated that they have the necessary skills. In other cases, their leader has reverted to micro-managing. In any large company, you will find a mix. The question really is what is the primary model at this company? Remember that no company is perfect.\n“I know someone that works at one of these companies considered among the best, and he says that their culture is terrible and nobody should try to emulate them.”\nThe cultures of the companies we highlight vary dramatically, and have usually been heavily influenced by their founders. They also change over time (especially after the founders leave). We focus instead on the underlying product first principles, and we find that these are remarkably consistent across innovative companies. Those are what we focus on, and what we encourage others to learn from.\nBut more generally, if you are looking for reasons to avoid the effort to try to make your company better, it is not hard to find them. In fact, we highlight the most common reasons for failure here.\n“Is a bet at one level, just a feature at another level?“\nA bet is an outcome you are seeking (a problem to be solved), and a feature is output (a particular approach to a solution someone wants you to build).\nA bet is just one metaphor for expressing your product strategy, and your product strategy is what drives the areas your company wants to invest in. The key to empowerment is to be sure to give your product teams as much latitude in coming up with the most appropriate solution as possible.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/transformed-faq/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925892386,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Two in a Box PM - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my earlier article on the six different models of Product Ops I have found in practice, I mentioned that there were two overarching issues behind the most damaging models, and I promised to discuss each further.\nIn my last article I talked about the tendency to think you can scale with process rather than with people, and in this article I’d like to talk about the tendency to want to split the product management job in two, referred to as the “two in a box” PM model.\nOne of the things that makes this problem difficult to discuss is that so many people in the product world can’t even agree on what the real role of the product manager is.  \nThis is endlessly frustrating to me, but I’ve come to understand that the root of this confusion is that as an industry we use the same title – product manager – for two very different situations: feature teams vs product teams. \nOne of the few things both groups generally agree on is that however you define the job, it’s often too much work for one person.\nHence the very understandable desire to cut the role up, and split it among two or more different people.\nI will tell you up front that in a great many situations I see, the way the job is defined indeed really is too much for one person.  And when I say “too much,” I don’t just mean stress level and work hours, I also mean not having the time to focus on the activities truly critical for success.\nBut the way the job is scoped down is the key, and unfortunately, the most common ways of trimming down the role have consequences far worse than most companies realize.\nLet’s begin this discussion by first saying that what I’m talking about here in this article is the PM role on an empowered product team.  In fact, much of what I say below doesn’t even apply to the PM role in a feature team, although many of the remedies do apply.\nThe job of a product manager of an empowered product team is to be responsible and accountable for addressing value and viability risk.  The designer covers usability risk, and the tech lead covers feasibility risk.  Together, they create a product.\nIn order for the product manager to be effective in addressing value and viability, there are a few things that are absolutely critical, and these are what you need to be very careful about preserving as you go about scoping down the role:\nDirect Access To Users and Customers\nThis should be obvious but without direct, unencumbered access to users and customers, the product manager has little hope of any kind of success in solving for value.  The users and customers provide not only inspiration for unaddressed problems but also the means to rapidly test our proposed solutions.  A little less obvious is the need for direct access to the data about these users and customers, such as how our users interact with our product.  I don’t mean direct access to raw data – but definitely direct access to the data tools, and to data analysts that can help interpret confusing or ambiguous data.\nDirect Access to Business Stakeholders\nSolving for viability is about solving for business constraints, and it’s essential that the product manager has direct access to the experts across your business that are responsible for these constraints – in marketing, sales, services, finance, legal, compliance, manufacturing, subject matter experts, and more.  The product manager must establish relationships with these people where the stakeholder believes that the product manager understands the relevant constraints and will ensure they are addressed in any proposed solution.\nDirect Access to Engineers and Designer\nFinally, value and viability depend on usability and feasibility, and the engineers work daily with the enabling technology, and the designer is directly responsible for the user experience, so discovering a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible and viable is predicated on deep, ongoing collaboration with engineering and design.  When you understand why engineers are so consistently the source of true innovation, you understand that if you lose this direct access, you quickly lose your chance at innovation.\nWhat this means is that you need to protect the product manager’s direct access to these three constituencies, and fight any temptation to place a person (or process) between the PM and these people.\nIt is in fact the direct, ongoing access to these three constituencies that enables the product manager to make good decisions regarding value and viability.\nThis is leading to another discussion on the very nature of technology-powered products and innovation, but that’s a more philosophical topic, so I’ll be going deeper on that point in an upcoming article, but for now, the point I wanted to make is to please do not slice up the PM role such that direct access to any of these three is lost.\nBecause this is such an important point, I want to be explicit:\nCutting up the PM job to have a product manager that interacts with customers and stakeholders, but a different person (e.g. product owner) that interacts with the engineers, causes the PM to lose the direct access to engineers.\nSimilarly, cutting up the PM role to have a different person (e.g. one of the definitions of a product ops manager) interacting with one class of stakeholders – sales, services, support, operations – loses the ability for the PM to have direct access to these critical sources of input.\nWhen I refer to the two-in-a-box PM anti-pattern, it is referring to splitting up responsibility for these three constituencies among two different people.  There are many ways this happens, but in my experience, this is a very serious mistake leading to long-term negative consequences.\nHopefully at this point, even on an intuitive level, you can see how if you want your product managers to be responsible for value and viability, you understand why this direct ongoing access to customers, stakeholders, and engineers would be key.\nSo, you might be thinking, what’s left to cut?\nA remarkable amount, it turns out.  \nNow don’t misunderstand me – all the responsibilities I’m about to describe below are ones I have seen PM’s be responsible for numerous times, but that doesn’t mean that it’s common that a PM has all of these additional responsibilities.  Fortunately, I don’t recall ever seeing a situation that bad.  But it’s not unusual to find more than one, and realize that each of these can represent a very significant load.\nProject Management\nThe most common additional burden on a product manager is project/program/delivery management.  I’ve written many times about this issue.  The good news is that this can be remedied relatively easily and quickly, although ironically sometimes the PM is reluctant to let go of these responsibilities, so coaching may be required.\nProduct Design\nIn some companies, while they may have designers, if they are graphic/visual designers rather than product designers, there’s a pretty big gap left uncovered – service design, interaction design, and often user research as well.  This may be tougher to fix because finding product designers is generally harder than finding delivery managers (that’s just an observation on market supply, not a judgment).\nUser Research Administration\nIt’s increasingly common for product teams and especially product managers to take an active role in user research.  That’s a good thing because of the principle of shared learning in product discovery.  However, in many cases, while the product designer plays the key role in user research (they’ve usually been trained on doing that well), the product manager often picks up the research administrative load.  This includes recruiting, screening, and scheduling users and customers.  It’s not that this is cognitively hard, but it is time consuming.  When I find this situation, I strongly encourage the organization to get some part-time administrative help to support this work.  It’s a low-cost and high-leverage fix.\nQuality Assurance\nThis one never ceases to amaze me when I find it, but in a surprising number of companies, the engineers pride themselves on not having QA or test automation engineers.  They think test-driven development and a nice suite of unit level regression tests is all they need to do.  But in practice, the PM’s end up having to play the QA role, which is normally a very time consuming job, and a big responsibility if the company cares at all about their customers.  Now it’s important to note that it’s normal for the PM to be responsible for acceptance testing, but that is a very minor responsibility compared to the much larger quality assurance role.  When I find this I tell the CTO they need to either have their engineers step up and ensure they are delivering working software, or they need to hire QA engineers.\nCustomer Service\nEvery product manager has some level of customer service responsibilities, if nothing else helping the customer service people diagnose issues and problematic use cases.  But in some cases, especially in smaller companies that have yet to staff up customer service or a customer success function, this load can easily grow to consume the PM.\nProduction Operations\nI discussed this in the Product Ops Overview article, but for certain products, the run-time operations load is significant, and while it’s good for the PM to understand the issues so that automation can be addressed where it makes sense, this can also be a very significant and stressful use of time.\nProduct Marketing\nThe product marketing role (PMM) is often under-appreciated and understaffed.  Especially for B2B companies with a direct sales organization, this can be a very large responsibility and very much a full time job on its own.  Not every product team, even in the same company, is impacted by product marketing responsibilities to the same degree, but if you have a PM that has significant PMM responsibilities as well, that is a recipe for long hours and a lot of stress.\nPeople Management \nI’ll admit that this one really irks me.  But I meet too many PM’s that tell me that they want to hire an “associate PM” (or some such title) reporting directly to them (in a people management sense) to handle mundane tasks like attending standups, writing user stories, dealing with tickets in Jira, scheduling meetings, or whatever.  Yet I point out to them that they can easily end up spending as much time managing this direct report, as they might get in any time savings.  But more generally I really don’t like the message a PM assistant role sends to the rest of the product team.  The engineers don’t like spending time in Jira either.  Should they each hire “associate engineers” to cover the administrative tasks they don’t like doing?  Product teams should be a flat structure and the product manager should not have to worry about people management as well as their product’s value and viability, so please don’t do this.\nProduct Team Size and Scope\nThe most obvious way to reduce the scope of a PM job is to consider the size and scope of the product team.\nThere is a natural balance between the product manager and designer, and a given number of engineers.  If you have a single product manager responsible for providing valuable and viable solutions for more than about 10 engineers, then this may simply be too much for a single product manager to keep up with, and it may be time to split teams.\nOr, occasionally I’ll see a company where each product manager is responsible for multiple product teams, sometimes with more than 20 engineers in total.  In every case like this I’ve seen, the results have been weak, almost always devolving into delivery teams.\nThe tougher case is when the balance is within the normal range, but depending on the nature of the work, and the experience level of the team members, you may still be out of balance.  It’s normally a lot less work for a PM to cover a team of 4 engineers versus a team of 8 engineers. In this case, you can consider reducing the size and/or scope of the product team.  \nBut this quickly becomes a team topology topic, with much more significant implications. Further, there are other benefits to having larger scope product teams, especially in terms of empowerment and autonomy.  So I prefer to focus first on reducing the personal responsibilities of the product manager.\nBut as you can see, if you want to prune down the responsibilities of your product managers to ensure they have the time and energy to sustainably cover their critical responsibilities, there are usually several very effective ways to do that, without gutting the role and destroying your chances of innovation.\nOne last important caveat: There is a real difference between a product manager at an early stage startup, versus at a growth stage or established company.  In many early stage startups, there literally are not enough funds to have people dedicated for many of the roles, and in practice the product manager often picks up much of this work (everyone usually has to wear multiple hats).  Partly this works out ok because the load is usually still small (e.g. we don’t yet have many customers or stakeholders).  But I’ll also admit that I’ve never felt more pressure than during my early stage startup experiences, so it’s important to know what you’re getting into if you want to join an early stage company.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/two-in-a-box-pm/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925821508,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Types of Product Coaching - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tWhen I announced the experimental Coach the Coaches session in London in May, I really didn’t know what level of interest to expect, but the demand has been remarkable and very encouraging.  I was worried we wouldn’t be able to fill up the room, and now I feel bad for all the people we won’t be able to fit into the session.\nBut one other benefit of reaching out to the product coaching community is that several of them have reached back out to me and introduced themselves, and shared with me their career and coaching goals.  Many have asked questions about the nature of the different types of coaching I see out there, and I found myself explaining some of the same concepts multiple times, and I realized that there really isn’t a well-accepted taxonomy of the different types of product coaching.\nSo my goal with this article is to suggest such a taxonomy.  There’s nothing earth-shaking in here, but I do think it would help both coaches, and the companies those coaches engage with, to have a consistent way of describing the different types of help.  I’ve used these terms myself for many years, although I’ve never really explained them in my writing.\nLet me say up front that these different types of coaching I’m about to describe are not mutually exclusive.  I know more than a few coaches that are very capable of coaching at multiple levels.  But I think it’s also true that even with those people, they have a strong preference for where they like to spend their time.\nFirst I’ll describe the product-related coaching I see out there, and then the adjacent types of coaching.\nDelivery Coaching\nMany companies are still releasing monthly or worse.  Moving to the product model means small, frequent, reliable, uncoupled releases, and being able to collect the data to prove that you achieved the necessary outcomes.  If a company has never moved to continuous deployment, or put in place the necessary instrumentation / telemetry / monitoring tooling, or the infrastructure for running A/B tests, then a delivery coach can work with the engineers to put this foundation in place.\nDiscovery Coaching\nThe foundation of product coaching is discovery coaching.  I’ve written about this type of coaching before as it’s so important.  Just as product teams looking to improve their delivery skills will often use a delivery coach to help them improve on delivery, teams learning to do product discovery often benefit from discovery coaching.\nI see more discovery coaching opportunities out there than anything else, simply because there are so many product teams out there asking for help.  Moving from a feature team to an empowered product team primarily means learning how to discover a solution worth building, and this is what product discovery is all about. \nAll the successful discovery coaches I know are former product managers, product designers, or tech leads, that have learned the skills and techniques of effective product discovery, and love to share their knowledge with others.\nOne thing I have learned over the past few weeks is that there are a much larger number of in-house discovery coaches than I realized, and there is a real need to provide these in-house coaches the necessary tools and training.\nProduct Leadership Coaching\nAs I’ve said many times, product leadership is hard.  Especially when trying to move from a feature-team based organization to empowered product teams.   There are now big and critical topics like product vision, team topology, product strategy, team objectives, and of course developing their own staffing and coaching skills.\nMany people, especially in rapidly growing companies, have had “battlefield promotions,” and now find themselves leading product, design or engineering, and they know they need help.  The client here is usually the CPO/VP Product and/or the CTO/VP Engineering.\nAll the successful product leadership coaches I know are former heads of product or heads of technology, who have figured out how to tackle these big topics, and want to share what they’ve learned with others.\nTransformation Coaching\nThe third main type of coaching I see are those that help guide the senior leadership team through the necessary changes in mindset and culture needed to move from a feature-team based company to empowered product teams (aka moving from a project to product-based culture).\nThe client in this case is usually the CEO or GM of a large business unit.  They know they need to change product and engineering, but they know it will be even more difficult to change the way they fund (finance), the way they staff (HR), the way they market and sell (sales and marketing), and more.\nWhat makes this type of coaching especially tough is that the vast majority of CEO’s simply won’t trust the future of their company to a product coach that has not “been there and done that” as a senior leader with other large and complex companies.  \nThey need someone that can hold their own with the company’s CFO, and explain to the head of sales why changes are necessary, yet can also engage directly with engineers, designers and product managers.\nIt’s little wonder why so few transformations succeed.  There are just very few people equipped to help.  In every successful transformation I know, there was someone that knew what was necessary, and had a trust-based relationship with the CEO.\nOther Types of Coaches\nIn addition to the very common Agile/Delivery Coaches I already mentioned, there are also several specialty coaches including OKR Coaches, CEO Coaches, Growth and/or Retention Coaches, Marketing Coaches and Sales Coaches.\nYou could argue that what I’m focused on now, coaching other coaches, is another type of coaching, sort of meta-coaching, but I think it’s likely a niche.\nHopefully this taxonomy of discovery coaches, product leadership coaches and transformation coaches makes sense and is useful to both coaches, and those of you at product companies.  And just to be clear, the Coaching The Coaches session is open to all three types of product coaches.\nIf you know of other relevant types of coaches, please share that with me.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/types-of-product-coaching/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925891135,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Value and Viability - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThere’s an adage about product managers that goes, “When the product succeeds, it’s because everyone on the product team did what they needed to do; but when the product fails, it’s the product manager.”\nI am fairly certain that I first heard this from Ben Horowitz many years ago, but I’ve no idea if he coined the phrase, or if he learned it from others.\nIn any case, a few people recently have asked me about this, and if it’s really fair for the product manager to take the blame but not the credit?\nIt seemed to me that this is a good excuse to highlight the essential difference between the role of the product manager on an empowered product team versus a feature team.\nAs a reminder, on empowered product teams, the product manager is responsible for value and viability, the designer is responsible for usability and the engineers are responsible for feasibility.  Together we make a product.\nNote that if you’re a product manager on a feature team, then you’re not responsible for value or viability (the stakeholder requesting the project or feature is), so this doesn’t apply to you.\nBut for those on empowered product teams, this adage is trying to remind product managers of two important points:\nFirst, since product managers don’t actually build anything, it should be obvious that they would never get sole credit when something succeeds.  They certainly share in the credit, and they are generally well-rewarded for success, but good luck trying to create a successful product without the help of designers or engineers. \nSecond, since value is in no small part a consequence of viability, usability and feasibility, if a product fails – in other words, if the product does not succeed in demonstrating the necessary value – maybe because the solution wasn’t viable, or wasn’t usable, or wasn’t feasible, or maybe the solution wasn’t any of these things, yet somehow the product still shipped.  When we say that “the product manager is responsible for value” we’re saying that we’re counting on the product manager to ensure that all of these risks have been addressed.\nThere is no question that being accountable for overall value is a significant responsibility, and not an easy one.  \nStanding up and taking responsibility for mistakes is something good cultures encourage.  We can learn a great deal from mistakes, and it’s the foundation for improvement.  It’s also the foundation for the critical sense of ownership that we try so hard to nurture in empowered product teams.\nBut put yourself in your CEO’s shoes for a minute.  You have product teams asking to be empowered to figure out the best solution to the problems they’re asked to solve, and saying they are willing to be held accountable to the results.  \nBut who exactly is the CEO supposed to look to for that accountability?  If it’s not the product manager, then who?  Most designers and engineers certainly didn’t sign up for that (and haven’t been trained and coached for that).\nIn companies where the product managers are not willing or able to take responsibility for value and viability, then the leadership ends up looking to others to take on that responsibility.  Sometimes it’s a stakeholder or a line manager, and sometimes someone is named a GM or other form of business owner, and they’re given the responsibility.\nUnfortunately, now you’re a feature team there to implement what that stakeholder or GM considers valuable.\nWhile I don’t want to understate the difficulty of taking responsibility for value and viability, and I know that some people are not interested in that level of responsibility, I also know that for many people, this is precisely the role they are looking for, and gets right to the core of why the product management job on an empowered product team is so rewarding.\nThis article is primarily about ensuring value, but the discussion makes me realize that I also need to elaborate more on what it means to be responsible for viability.  \nFor a product to be viable, our marketing organization must be able to effectively market it, sales must be able to effectively sell, finance needs to be able to effectively fund and monetize, and our offering needs to be legal and compliant with relevant regulations, as just some of the most common examples.\nWhen a product manager says, “not my fault” that sales can’t sell, they are not only mistaken, but they are missing the point of their role.\nBut that’s another article, or more likely a series of articles.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/value-and-viability/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925903773,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Videos Archive - Page 2 of 3 - Silicon Valley Product

Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tMy husband and I were watching the Daily Show the other night on our DVR, fast forwarding through commercials as we usually do.\nOut of the corner of my eye, I noticed the text “Palm Pre” and yelled, “Back up!” to my husband. I hadn’t yet seen the Pre and was interested in Palm’s latest ‘Hail Mary.’\nA head-in-the clouds (literally) waif spoke in an ethereal voice about days when all the streetlights turn green. I could kind of see a glimpse of the product behind her well-coiffed head. Finally, she held the phone up so I could see it and zipped through three unintelligible screens. The commercial ended suddenly with the phone’s slick black case closing–hiding the whole interface–and the text ‘Palm Pre.’ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIknaMyJhvw&feature=related.\nI’m a big fan of the song they chose, which is the ONLY reason I enjoyed any of the commercial.\nMinutes later, an ad came on for the new iPhone. I could see the phone. I saw the apps in action. It was no mystery why the phone they were showing was impressive. After 30 seconds, I was both more interested and educated.\nThese ads were sandwiched between others for movies and life-style cars–lots of darkness, big action, and sexy people. Especially in fast forward, one smart phone ad stood out. The other didn’t.\nI felt sad…really sad for Palm and all the hard-working people whose interesting product remained utterly mysterious to me, a potential early adopter and evangelist.\nRelevance Requires Context.\nProducts need to be relevant for people to pay attention, and that requires setting the proper context. If you don’t understand your customers’ context–how messaging appears relative to everything else around them–your marketing won’t work.\nA recent Stanford University study found that our hunger for connections is what creates huge audiences for stories about Jon and Kate’s marital woes or Michael Jackson’s death. It gives us social currency and connects us to a larger national conversation. Even ‘experts’ on a subject, tend to talk about things everyone knows to establish a connection.\nSuccessful marketing requires knowing what’s in the national conversation, and I don’t mean current events.  It’s hard for products to seem relevant if its marketing isn’t. This ranges from understanding cultural context to the visuals and messaging competing for people’s attention. Technology marketers tend to be intellectual snobs about mass media, but at the end of the day, everyone–even your most elite customers–downshift their brains.\nWatch Cable TV and Read Pop Culture Magazines. \nChoose something targeted, which provides both more to study and usually more relevant competition context for technology marketers. But also read People magazine or look at entertainment headlines because the glitzy stuff is what’s getting people’s attention. Think about how and if you can tie your product into what’s culturally relevant.\nYouTube is also great to browse through because you can see exactly how much traction and audience something has found. Study what’s working and you’ll start to find common threads.\nCreate a Hook.\nLike good pop songs, good marketing needs a hook “P-p-p-poker face, Mum mum mum mah…” (if you don’t know that reference, you need to get out more.) Especially if you’re trying to differentiate in a crowded category, your marketing must quickly communicate why people should pay attention. Hooks can be stories, a cool feature or innovative visuals. Regardless of the hook, be sure to SHOW not TELL your product’s ‘hook.’ Watch this phone do this amazing thing vs. “Look at our amazing phone!”\nPeople believe what they see and can judge for themselves. This is why infomercials and direct marketing never die–seeing is believing.\nHow to Show Relevance Beyond Pop Culture.\nCritical reviews, identifying categories or their attributes, analyst reports, third-party studies, success, blogs, comments or commentary, and stories all set context. Become a student of what grabs your own attention or what seems to be getting others’ and apply this knowledge as you create or measure your own marketing.\nSo yes, cruise Twitter even if you hate it. Spend idle time on Facebook. Get caught reading People magazine. Watch reality TV.\nIt is not just a guilty pleasure. If you’re in marketing, it’s part of your job.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/watch-cable-tv-and-read-people-magazine/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925953466,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Waterfall Deconstructed - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIt’s hard to find anyone that actually defends a Waterfall process anymore.  Agile methods might have their flaws, but at least they are usually much lesser flaws than Waterfall.\nYet I actually meet many teams that claim to be practitioners of Agile and Lean, yet when they show me how they work, I all too often have to reluctantly point out to them that they might have the rituals and ceremony of Agile, and they’ve got the Lean buzzwords down, but when you peel all that away, they are really still practicing Waterfall.\nI wrote about this topic more generally in Product Fail, but one follow-up question I often get is what are the telltale signs of teams that are still caught in this trap?\nThere are three defining characteristics of Waterfall teams.  Any one of these is a very strong indicator of Waterfall, but in my experience, if you find one you will usually find all three:\nRisks At The End\nIf the team waits months until their engineers have actually built a product or feature, or even a half-baked approximation of a product (usually incorrectly referred to as an “MVP”) before they see if this is something they can sell, and that user’s can use, and that is technically feasible, and that can work for the business, then all the risk is at the end of the process; which is the traditional defining characteristic of Waterfall.\nWe are looking for the team to tackle these risks before they have the engineers spend the time and money to build a shippable product.\nRequirements Driving Design Driving Code\nIf the team has a product manager defining (or worse, gathering) requirements, either in the form of some requirements document and/or user stories, and then passing those along to a designer that is asked to design a user experience that meets those requirements (usually in the form of annotated wireframes and/or comps), and then that information is provided to engineers at Sprint Planning where they are asked to architect an implementation, estimate and then build, then this sequential product definition gets to the heart of what makes a process Waterfall.\nWhat we are looking for instead, is defining the product collaboratively, with product, design and engineering working side-by-side, in a back and forth, give and take, to come up with a solution that is valuable, usable, feasible and viable.  The enabling technology informs the design and the functionality, as much as the other way around.\nFocus on Output\nIf the efforts of the team are focused on delivering a feature or a project, usually due to some product roadmap commitment, and there is no team accountability to an actual business result, then this is the third clear sign of Waterfall.\nWe are looking for a team to take responsibility for solving the underlying business and/or customer problem and not just delivering the feature on the roadmap.  If that feature doesn’t solve the problem, then they need to iterate on that feature, or take another approach to solving the problem.\nSometimes Agile teams talk about the concept of “Done Done” which generally refers to getting something to the point it really is shippable – not just done coding, but is integrated, QA’d and shipping.  That’s significant, but not nearly as far as what I’m talking about.  For modern product, it also has to solve the underlying business problem, and that typically involves much more effort and skill.\nThe Big Tell\nThere is one extremely easy way to quickly assess if the team is very likely still Waterfall.  Just find out overall how many things were defined (in the last month or quarter), and then how many things were actually built and delivered (in the last month or quarter).\nA team still essentially doing Waterfall will deliver roughly as many things as they define.\nA team that’s truly embraced modern methods and has meaningfully moved beyond Waterfall, will have tried out at least twice as many ideas in discovery as they build out in delivery.  A really good team will deliver an even smaller percentage (not by delivering less but by trying out many more).\nIt’s only product discovery if you’re actually discovering a solution that works.  It’s just same-old product definition if you’re simply defining what you want engineering to build.\nThis is why I push teams, whatever their preferred process or techniques, to ensure they are focused on these three big areas: tackling the risks up front, defining products collaboratively, and focusing on results.  These are also, not coincidentally, the three overarching themes in my new book.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/waterfall-deconstructed/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925976613,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"What Makes a Great CTO? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThe job of the product manager is to define the products that the product development organization will build. Even with the greatest product ideas, if you can’t build and launch your service, it remains just an idea. So your relationship with the product development organization is all important.\nI thought I would discuss in this article the leader of the product development organization. I wrote this piece together with my partner Chuck Geiger, as he has run several world-class product organizations. I have often said that if as product manager you have a good working relationship with your product development counterpart, then this is a great job. If you don’t, you’re in for some very tough days. So in the spirit of developing a better appreciation for what makes a great product development organization, we offer this summary.\nFirst, let’s be clear which organization we’re referring to. This is the organization responsible for architecture, engineering, QA, site operations, site security, release management, and usually project management. This group is responsible for building and running the company’s products and services.\nThe titles vary, but often include VP Product Development, or CTO. For startups, the title is often simply VP Engineering, but as companies get larger, the focus is not solely on engineering and expands to product development and technology overall. In this article, we’ll refer to the head of this product development organization as the CTO – chief technology officer, but feel free to substitute the term your company uses.\nThere are five major responsibilities of a CTO. We present them here in priority order, and discuss how each is typically measured:\nOrganization\nBuild an excellent organization, with a strong management team committed to developing the skills of your employees. We typically measure effectiveness here by looking at development plans for all of the employees, the retention rate, and the evaluation of the managers and the overall product organization by the rest of the company.\nDelivery\nMake sure this organization can rapidly, reliably and repeatedly deliver quality product to market. There are several measures of delivery, including some measure of the quantity of work delivered, the consistency and frequency of release vehicles, and the quality/reliability of the delivered/launched software. Some organizations just look at reliability here, but productivity in the sense of quantity and quality is the real key.\nArchitecture\nMake sure the company has an architecture necessary to deliver the functionality, scalability and performance it needs to in order to compete and thrive. The measures for architecture will vary based on your business, but in general we look to track and measure headroom/infrastructure work, and measure site outages due to architectural issues.\nDiscovery\nMake sure that the architecture and senior engineering staff are participating actively, and contributing significantly, throughout product discovery. If your engineers and architects are only being used to write software then you are only getting a fraction of the value from them you should be. We suggest you track the participation of the product development/technology organization in product discovery (both duration and coverage), and the number of innovations that are credited to the engineering/architecture participant. It is also useful, although a little sensitive, to track changes to schedule post-discovery (churn), as you are always trying to reduce churn.\nEvangelism\nThe CTO will serve as the company spokesperson for the product development/technology organization, demonstrating leadership in the community, with developers, partners and customers. This is often measured by establishing a university relations/recruitment program, and sponsoring or participating in at least two events per year in the developer community.\nYou may want to go to lunch with your engineering counterpart and discuss what they see as their biggest challenges and how you might be able to help from the product side. Anything you can do to help each other out will go a long way to creating a truly effective overall product organization, able to define and deliver winning products.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/what-makes-a-great-cto/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925976352,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"What Product Management Is Not - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI find that many companies remain stuck in old, failed models of product management, and don’t always realize how important role definition is to building effective teams and successful products.\nIn several articles I’ve tried to explain what the role of the product manager is really all about, but in this article, I’d like to come at this from another angle and try to emphasize what the job is NOT. I’m hoping that calling out these misunderstandings will help companies realize where they have issues and hopefully revisit how they are defining this role.\n– Product Management is not defining the business case\nSome product managers believe their job is simply to define the business case for why this product should be built. Is the business case important?\nOf course. Mainly because management will use this to make decisions on where to invest. But this doesn’t really do anything to contribute to actually creating the product. In many organizations the product manager does put the business case together, or at least contributes to creating the case, and this is fine, but don’t confuse this with the product management job.\n– Product Management is not defining market requirements\nFor many companies, they think the product manager defines the market requirements and the engineers build a product to meet those market needs. The product manager creates an MRD (Market Requirements Document) that enumerates what the product manager thinks the market is looking for, and then actually defining the product that meets these requirements is an exercise left to the reader (which is typically an engineer). There are really two issues here.\nThe first is the fallacy of so-called “market requirements.” Markets don’t have requirements. People do. And the person that’s actually going to be defining this product has got to talk to these people directly. If the engineer is the one defining the product, then that person is the true product manager and you can only hope he understands that as the product manager he needs direct face-time with actual users and customers.\nThe second issue is the fallacy of market requirements separate from product requirements. The whole idea is to discover a product-market fit and this requires a deep understanding of both the market needs and the technology’s capabilities. It is during the discovery process that you identify true market requirements and technical solutions that successfully address these requirements.\n– Product Management is not requirements gathering\nMany companies, especially those with a direct sales organization, have the model where the job of the product manager is to gather up the requirements from the customers or prospective customers, document them for engineering, and then make sure those requirements are delivered by the dates the sales guys promised the customer.\nThis is not product management. This is project management for custom software solutions. True product companies know that customers have issues that need to be addressed, but they are not in a position to dictate the product requirements. In other words, you can’t make the mistake of confusing a customer requirement with a product requirement.\nBe wary of anything that encourages this “requirements capture” or “requirements management” mentality. It is a very slippery slope and one of the surest paths to failed products.\n– Product Management is not project management\nIn some companies, the product management group was borne out of the project/program management organization, especially when the company has an IT or custom software heritage. In this model, the product manager is considered the person to collect and document the requirements, and manage the project from conception to delivery. But the discovery process is not simply a task in a project plan. It is its own process, which is very different than the product development process. Moreover, rarely do you find individuals that like both product management (discovery) and project\nmanagement (delivery) as the nature of each type of person is so different.\n– Product Management is not product marketing\nFinally, product management is not about pricing, promotions, positioning and messaging, or product launch activities. Nor is it about online marketing and customer acquisition strategies or influencer marketing programs. These are all critically important activities, and the product manager will provide input to many of these activities, but don’t confuse them with product management. These are product marketing activities, and for all but the smallest products, you are going to need a skilled marketing person dedicated to this. While the company might be tempted to ask the product manager to cover these responsibilities as well, realize that the nature of these marketing-based activities is dramatically different than the discovery-based activities, and it’s very hard to find people that are skilled at both.\nIn contrast to the above, the product manager is responsible for discovering a product that is useful, usable and feasible. If he can do this, he’s done his job. If he can’t, there’s no point in spending the time and money to build and launch the product.\nIf your company makes any of the mistakes above, pass this note on to your management. Ask if perhaps you could try adjusting the role on your next product to see what happens. I think you’ll find that if you can focus on discovery, you’ll get a chance to show your company what product management is really all about.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/what-product-management-is-not/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925870091,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"What is a Product? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tI promise this will not be one of those navel-gazing exercises.  This is going to be a very pragmatic article about a critical and fundamental topic.\nOne of the consequences of the popularity of the earlier article on empowered product teams is that it uncovered several significant areas of confusion about product.\nThere are many important dimensions to the general topic of what’s a product, but in this article, I want to talk about why being a truly cross-functional product team is so essential, and not just some industry buzzword.\nFor a little context, when product was first explained to me, I was an engineer at a very engineering-centric company (HP Labs).  If you weren’t some form of engineer you were generally considered overhead.  Even the designers called themselves “Human Factors Engineers.”\nWhen I was being coached on the tech lead role, my engineering manager needed me to understand that when creating products for the real world, engineering was not enough.  He drew on the whiteboard a very simple but important equation:\nProduct = Customer x Business x Technology\nHe went on to explain that a successful tech product has to solve for the customer, has to solve for our business, and has to solve for the technology.\nThis equation maps to our four big risks in tech products: addressing usability risk is part of solving for the customer; addressing feasibility risk is part of solving for the technology; and addressing business viability risk is part of solving for the business.  And value risk is a function of all three.\nAnd further, he pointed out that if you don’t address any one of these three, then the result (the product) is going to be a failure (for the mathematically challenged, anything times zero is zero).\nHe then went on to describe the role of the product manager in solving for the business; the role of the designers in solving for the customers; and I was already pretty well-versed in the role of engineers in solving for the technology.\nHe went further to explain that these three areas were deeply intertwined.\nThe technology decisions can dramatically impact what the designers can do (for better or for worse).  Likewise, the design decisions can significantly impact the business considerations.  And, of course, the business constraints can and will impact the design and technology options.\nBecause I was moving into the tech lead role, he emphasized to me that my job was no longer just about engineering.  I had to step up and collaborate with the product manager and designer on discovering effective solutions.\nHopefully, for most of you, this is all Product 101.  You’ve already figured this out one way or another.  However, I can tell you that many people in the product world have not.\nI constantly meet startup founders and product managers that think it’s all about the business model.  They bring me a business model canvas that’s all filled in (but unvalidated) that shows a beautiful business that’s sure to make a ton of money.  They’ve thought through pricing, cost structure, value proposition, and go-to-market strategy.  All they need from me is the name of an agency that can whip them up an app.  I wish what I just wrote was an exaggeration.\nI also meet far too many designers, and even some design leaders (and more than a few product managers), that think product is all about the user experience.  They believe that if they just make their customers happy they’ll be successful.  If only it were that easy.  They don’t even pretend to be concerned about the economics or other business considerations – revenue, costs, sales, marketing, legal, privacy, etc.\nAnd it’s also no secret that there’s many engineers out there that don’t see the point in either product management or design.\nIt’s absolutely critical that your company’s leaders in product management, user experience design, and engineering all have a deep understanding of this fundamental equation of product, and they need to actively coach their product managers, designers and engineers on this as well.\nJust to drive this point home, I’m going to be very explicit here:\nIf the CEO of your company gets it in his or her head that one or more of your product managers has no real understanding of how the business really works, then that person has little hope of being trusted and empowered.  I can tell you that the CEO is judging product managers on this, and if they are perceived as naïve or worse, it is going to be very hard to turn that perception around.  This is why I’m pretty relentless with new product managers that they absolutely need to do their homework.\nMoreover, if the CEO views one or more of the leaders of product, design or engineering as not understanding what’s involved in solving for the business, that leader has little chance of having a seat at the table when important decisions are made.\nSo don’t let anyone try to tell you it’s all about the business, or it’s all about the customer, or it’s all about the technology.  Product is harder than that.  It’s all about all three.\nSpecial thanks to my SVPG Partner Chris Jones for his help with a draft of this article.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/what-is-a-product/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925977087,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"What's a Beta? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tFor years people have been arguing about what the real purpose of a “beta” is. I used to argue this point as well, but today the term is so ambiguous that we all just need to accept that the term can be used for many different purposes, and what’s important to you is what you’re trying to accomplish.\nSome teams use “beta” as essentially a QA phase. Basically you’re letting your customers help you test the product. Either because you don’t have much QA staffing yourself, or because for your product, there are just too many run-time environments out there for you to replicate and test, so you put the software out in “beta” and then tackle the bugs as they come in. This sounds worse than it is. In truth, there are many bugs that you’ll only find once you launch, especially related to scale and performance. As long as the release has achieved a reasonable level of quality before launching this is fine.\nSome teams use “beta” as a gentle deployment mechanism. See https://svpg.com/gentle-deployment/ for the details, but the idea is that you deploy the new release as “beta” while you keep the existing release live, and over time you move users from the old to the new system, and when enough are there, you remove the “beta” tag and you then phase out the old. Think Yahoo Mail’s massive gentle deployment to their new Ajax-based mail client over the past year.\nOther teams use “beta” as a way to get user feedback on a product idea. For most types of products there are much less expensive ways to get this feedback than to build and launch the service like this, but for some types of products, it really is the only way to see if the idea is a good one. Especially products introducing something new enough that there isn’t an established or proven market, and you don’t really know if enough people out there are interested enough to make this product idea worthwhile.\nAll of these uses of “beta” are useful and appropriate in the right situations. The key is that all three of the above cases are actively managed by the product team and site analytics and feedback from users is used to make the product better as fast as possible.\nThere is, however, one other use of the term “beta” that is not quite as virtuous, but is nevertheless fairly common. Some teams use the term “beta” to represent software that has largely been abandoned by its product team. The software has the “beta” label because nobody wants to stand behind it. It essentially means, “take it or leave it.” This may be because the idea didn’t get traction, or because there aren’t people available to work on it because it’s not a high enough priority, or because business priorities changed, or because the company has a form of corporate ADD and they simply lost interest part way through. The internet is so littered with these “betas” it reminds me of all the orbiting space junk. For much the same reason. It can be easier to launch a new web service than it is to kill it and tell users they have to get off.\nI’m not thrilled about this use of “beta” because it can harm the three good uses of “beta” above, as it can make users hesitant to engage with something called “beta.”\nIf you have a product in this last form of beta, this is where it’s useful to be honest with your users and let them know that you are no longer promising to take this forward. Some teams label these products “sustaining only” meaning you’ll keep it running but that’s all. In any case, engaging with your users is good, and using their feedback to improve the product is even better.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/whats-a-beta/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925975182,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"What's in a Name? Less Than You Think. - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNo one coming to your website? Company image tired? Business plans changed? It’s time for a rebrand!\nOr maybe not.\nSomehow “brand” became magic pixie dust to sprinkle on company problems and make them go away. But you can’t create or fix a company with just a name, logo and color palette. Anyone remember Webvan’s “rebrand” into oblivion? In technology, we tend to think we’re the exception to all the rules. The problem is most don’t know the rules, which means brands don’t do what tech companies expect.\nWhat’s the problem? A true brand is much more than a company’s name, visual identity, or how much it advertises. A brand is a promise to customers that transcends any individual product or service. The best brands are built on a foundation of a simple product or service provided consistently. Cheap food fast? McDonalds. Mid-afternoon coffee boost? Starbucks. Need help finding the perfect tie for your suit? Nordstroms. Coolest new tech gadgets around? Apple. Need it overnight? FedEx.\nNow quick–Do you know how many logos these companies have gone through in the last five years? My guess is no, and you probably don’t care. This is the power of brand done right and also why creating one is so much harder than people think.\nMany high-tech brands start like this: the powers-that-be get together for a “brand brainstorm,” come up with a list of rational brand attributes like ‘smart’ and ‘innovative,’ put it in a PowerPoint presentation, hand it over to an agency that charges a small fortune to create a name and a logo the founders like, and viola a new brand is born. For most companies, the brand experience begins and ends there.\nAnd that’s the problem. Great brands are powerful because their relationship to us is emotional, not just rational. More importantly, they come from the systematic delivery against every aspect of the 4Ps, starting with products (or services). Genuine connections with customers can’t simply be brainstormed into a company mission statement. If your product or service doesn’t fulfill your brand promise, your name and logo don’t matter. Think about most of the newest generation of “breakout” online brands–YouTube, Facebook, FlickR, MySpace. They didn’t succeed because they spend millions on advertising or had great logos. They delivered a consistent product experience. The same holds true for the major online brands that preceded them: Google = search, Amazon = buy online, eBay = buy/sell peoples’ stuff.\nA brand isn’t any one thing; it is the collection of all the ways a company touches its customers–on the web, in advertising, in PR, in sales, in retail, and the products themselves–that create or reinforce a brand. This is why new logos and names don’t solve company problems; they usually aren’t the problem.\nSo if you’re a relatively new brand aspiring to become one of the great ones, what do you do?\n1. Start with your product/service.\nIn technology, you can’t have a great brand if your product or service isn’t. This doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be the most amazing product on the planet-just that what it is and does must be easy to understand, consistent in its presentation, and serve a need people remember or value. It’s easy to look at a company like Netflix and say, “Everyone knows the red envelope. It’s a brilliant brand.” But it’s their rich service that made the brand ubiquitous and successful.\n2. Be consistent.\nAfter having a good product, this is the single most important thing you can do, and it doesn’t take extra money, just discipline. Anything that touches the customer is part of the brand and either reinforces what you want the customer to believe or makes you look untrustworthy. This is the one of the biggest failings of technology companies; they stop at the colors and logo being on everything and fail to ensure all aspects of content and product support the brand.\nApple’s recent iPhone pricing debacle is an example. Strategically, a high price point at launch was a shrewd business decision–it limited distribution while they ironed out bugs and instantly gave early adopters the show-and-tell goodie of the decade. But when Apple dropped the price so quickly for essentially the same phone, it sent their fiercely loyal customers into an uproar. It made Apple look like they were exploiting their most loyal fans which is totally inconsistent with Apple’s “power-to-the-people,” populist brand. To Apple’s credit, they immediately addressed the problem.\n3. Look at the customer’s entire experience.\nEverything that touches a customer needs to embody a brand for a ‘brand effect’ to occur. From language, to look and feel, to how people behave-even dress-it all has an impact. One enterprise startup I know defined a key brand attribute as “leadership,” and they worked hard to ensure everything they did validated it. Their initial target customer list was Fortune 100 only so their customers’ brands could reinforce their leadership claims. Their employees also dressed in formal business wear when visiting a customer. They were told in competitive sales situations, they out-classed their competition, and this perception was reinforced by how everyone dressed. They behaved like leaders, even when they weren’t. Of course they had the products to back up the brand, but it all created a brand effect and momentum that helped them become an undisputed category leader over time.\nAgain, Apple is the king in technology of using the customer’s entire experience to reinforce their brand, from the elegant, hip packaging, to the lack of documentation, to the “geniuses” in the Genius Bar in Apple Stores-the very fact that they have a store-their advertising, and of course, their consistently stunning products.\n4. Don’t underestimate the power of people, pictures and music.\nThis is the easiest way to move something from rational to emotional. Those “Priceless” Mastercard ads have milked this to an extreme. VW uses music brilliantly in all their ads; BMW did an entire movie short series with A-list talent. But you don’t need to spend millions on TV or film ads to infuse emotion into your brand. People connect with people. Think about where you can humanize your brand experience-such as putting the picture of a tech support or sales person on your website saying “Talk to me live now!” Real people/customer quotes is another example. Having a real customer pick up the phone and call a potential customer is a powerful brand statement. And certainly if you have a direct sales force, they are your foremost brand emissaries.\n5. Separate company brand from product and service names.\nMany technology companies put their brand investment behind individual products or name the company the same as the product. This can be a fine start but make sure you adapt quickly if your business/products do. The difference is as simple as Oracle Database 11 instead of Oracle 11 or Yahoo! Search instead of just Yahoo! This type of brand strategy is called a “master brand” strategy and means 1) you invest in your company’s brand meaning, not your individual products 2) because the company name carries the consumer promise, it precedes every product or service name. It’s the most common brand and naming strategy used in technology where products change quickly.\nToo often technology companies don’t make these distinctions fast enough. Not only does this make things confusing to customers, it can put your business in a corner that is very hard to fight out of. Think about how many years, millions of dollars, and acquisitions it took Oracle to get beyond being just a database company. One of my alma maters, Netscape, never defined the brand beyond the browser, so when the browser was in decline, the entire company was perceived to be in decline. Don’t make this mistake.\n6. Be patient-stay steady.\nBuilding a brand takes a lot longer than you might wish, even when you employ the best techniques and everything is going great. It’s true some brands reach mass market recognition faster than others, but even the fastest take years before they reach mass consumer awareness. The more a company’s brand elements change in that period, the less a consumer has to hold on to and understand exactly what the company is about. Consider that each time some part of the brand experience changes, you’re starting over with some customers. And if the ultimate goal of brand is to short-cut decision-making, changes at the brand level take that potential away.\n7. New brands are okay for the right reasons.\nIf your market penetration is knowingly impeded by your existing brand’s baggage, then it makes sense to opt for change. My favorite example is Microsoft’s Xbox. They needed a new brand for gamers that shed the Microsoft baggage because, let’s face it, they just didn’t have street cred with gamers. Halo 3 is also marketed as its own brand, not as Microsoft Halo. It took Microsoft over a decade of trying with “Microsoft Home” and various other brand extensions before they finally took the plunge with a new brand. No doubt this was a battle with the corporate brand police, but ultimately, it was necessary for the product line and brand to succeed.\nGreat brands engender loyalty beyond reason – because an emotional attachment and consistent experience provide a short-cut for decision-making. Ultimately, brands are about trust-which is hard to gain and easy to lose. So when it comes to brands, take time to think about all aspects of your brand so it can help your company achieve its goals.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/whats-in-a-name-less-than-you-think/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925975326,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"When Performance Is Measured By Results - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNOTE: I was invited to write the foreword for Christina Wodke’s new book on OKR’s, Radical Focus, and I am sharing the foreword here.\nI was extremely fortunate to have started my career at Hewlett-Packard as an engineer during their heyday, when they were known as the industry’s most successful and enduring example of consistent innovation and execution.  As part of HP’s internal engineering management training program called “The HP Way,” I was introduced to a performance management system known as “MBO” – Management by Objectives.\nThe concept was straight-forward, and based on two fundamental principles.  The first can easily be summed up with the famous General George Patton quote: “Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results.”  The second was captured by HP’s tagline of that era, “When Performance Is Measured By Results.”  The idea here is that you can release all the features you want, but if it doesn’t solve the underlying business problem, you haven’t really solved anything.\nThe first principle is really about how to motivate people to get them to do their best work, and the second is all about how to meaningfully measure progress.\nSo much has changed since my time at HP.  The technologies are dramatically more advanced, the scale and scope of systems we build is several orders of magnitude larger, teams move much faster, generally with superior quality and performance, all delivered at a fraction of the cost.  However, these two performance management principles are still at the foundation of how the best companies and teams operate.\nThe MBO system was refined and improved at several companies over the years, most notably Intel, and today the primary performance management system we use is known as the “OKR” system – Objectives and Key Results.\nUnfortunately, another thing that hasn’t changed is that most teams still don’t operate with these principles.\nInstead, groups of executives and other stakeholders all too often come up with the quarterly “roadmap” of features and projects and then pass them down to the product teams, essentially telling them how to solve the underlying business problems.  The teams are just there to flesh out the details, code and test, with little understanding of the bigger context, and even less belief that these are in fact the right solutions.  Teams today are all too often feature factories, with little regard for whether or not the features actually solve the underlying business problems.  Progress is measured by output and not outcome.\nChristina’s book is intended to help any organization start operating like the best organizations.  I have seen these techniques deployed successfully in organizations as large as a 60,000 employee company to as small as a 3-person startup.  Large or small, if you’ve worked hard to hire smart people, this system will help you unleash their potential.\nChristina’s book is now available on Amazon.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/when-performance-is-measured-by-results/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925975232,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Where Should Product Management Live? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tThe single most frequent question I get from product leaders in companies both large and small, is where should product management live? The choices are most often engineering or marketing. While if you have the right personalities, it can work in either place, I’m actually not a fan of it residing in either.\nIn this note I’d like to lay out the considerations and my views on where product management should live organizationally.\nThe most common situation I find is that product management lives within the marketing organization. The problem with this organizational design is based on the misconception that you get products from talking to your customers, and that it is marketing’s job to talk to customers. I won’t repeat all my arguments here, but suffice it to say that there are several key reasons why you won’t find successful products just by asking your customers, and further, what usually happens is that the product marketing role and the product management role get combined. These roles and the skills required are so different that what usually ends up happening is that one or the other (or both) gets poorly executed.\nThe next most common situation is that product management is put in the engineering organization. While this has the benefit of putting the people that invent and design the product next to the people that actually build the product, this can also be problematic because engineering organizations are really designed to focus on building a product right, rather than building the right product. It takes a different mindset and different skills to come up with the right product to build. Moreover, it’s easy for the product management team to be consumed in the details and pressures of producing the detailed specs rather than looking at the market opportunity and charting a winning product strategy and roadmap.\nSo if not the marketing organization, and if not the engineering organization, then where?\nI am a believer in raising the level of the product organization to be on par with engineering and marketing. Ideally, the product organization includes the design team, because the interaction between product management and design needs to be absolutely as close as possible. Increasingly, you’ll see an organization with the name of “Product” or “Product Management” or “Product Management and Design” and often with a VP of Product or even a Chief Product Officer running it.\nThere are several benefits to this organizational design, but the biggest reason is that I believe that the head of product needs to have a seat at the table on the executive team. Companies are all about products, and marketing and engineering each have other considerations that typically supersede product. Additionally, this organizational structure makes it clear that the product is not being driven by the technology, and not being driven solely by the sales or marketing needs either.\nOne special case exists in many larger companies. Often large companies have a centralized engineering function and decentralized business units. This lets the company focus on multiple business lines, while potentially enjoying efficiencies in common engineering services. In such organizations, the product management and design function might be located in the centralized engineering/product development organization, or it might be in its own organization, or it might be a part of the business units themselves. Often in such an organization, the business unit managers must play a major product management role, so it can create problems if the product management team isn’t part of the business unit. In these situations, I usually prefer integrating product management and design into the business units.\nWhile I’ve explained my reasons for the ideal locations, it can be very hard to implement organizational design change, and your company may not be willing or able to go this route. This does not necessarily mean that you’re destined for problems. It still boils down to the people involved and the skills they bring. If you can develop your product team’s skills and demonstrate their value across the company, any of these organizational structures will succeed.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/where-should-product-management-live/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925973997,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Where To Work? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIt’s no secret that first due to the pandemic, then due to the economy, many people in many different industries have been furloughed or their companies have shut-down.  This has impacted product people as well.  Where just recently, a strong product person had their choice of great options, today the landscape looks quite different.  \nHopefully this will be temporary, but in any case many people have been asking me which companies are great places for product people to work?\nEspecially because many people realize that they are currently working on a feature team, and they really want to learn how to do true product management as part of an empowered product team.\nI have shared publicly the names of several excellent companies that are built on true product teams.  Google, Netflix, Amazon, Stripe, Atlassian and Apple are some of the well-known names.  And there are many excellent startups and growth-stage companies, far too many to list.\nHowever, I always try to point out that even at the strongest product companies, not every team is an empowered product team.\nBut what matters more than the company, is the person you would be reporting to.  \nThat is especially true if you are relatively new to product management, and/or have never worked at a company that is strong at product.\nSo I encourage people looking for a good position to do their homework.  They should find out who the hiring manager is, and use LinkedIn to see where they have worked, and if you know anyone that knows this manager, ask what they are like.\nWhen you’re interviewing, make clear to the hiring manager that you are there because you want to learn from her, and that you’re willing to put in the necessary effort, if she is willing to help you become exceptionally strong at your job.  \nRealize that even if the manager has the knowledge and ability to coach you, she may not have the time, so she may be looking for someone more experienced.  But most hiring managers would love someone that has strong potential, is very serious about their career, and is willing to put in the effort.\nBut be warned that hiring managers at strong product companies generally take the staffing responsibility very seriously, and they expect strong candidates.  Be sure you’ve done your homework both on what strong product managers are responsible for, and on the company, products and leaders you’d be working for.\nIt’s not very hard to spot how a company works during an interview.  If you have never worked in a strong product company before, and you need some help on what to look for, I’d suggest you review the series of articles on the before and after of transformation.  Just remember that no company is perfect so don’t be unrealistic, but at least you should know what you’re getting into.\nAnother pro tip is to read the book Never Search Alone and take advantage of the advice in there.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/where-to-work/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925793613,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Who Is Product Operating Model For? - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\nOne very common question we hear is: “We’re not a tech company, so is the product operating model even relevant for us?”\nThis is a very widespread confusion, and it’s putting countless companies at risk of disruption, so I’m hoping to do what I can to try to clarify this.\nWhen our industry refers to a “tech company,” this is not referring to what the company sells, it is referring to how the company believes they should power their business.\nTesla sells cars. Netflix sells entertainment. Google sells advertising. Airbnb sells vacation lodging. Amazon started with selling books and now sells just about everything.\nThe difference is not what these companies sell; it’s how they design and build what they sell, and how they serve their customers.\nThe product operating model is for companies that believe they should be powering their business with technology. \nToday, that’s a very wide range of businesses across virtually every industry. \nOne very common manifestation of this confusion is the framing in so many legacy companies of “digital product” versus “non-digital product.”\nSo many people think that – at most – the product model applies to their “digital products.”  But the real power of the product model is when applied holistically to all products.\nI realize that there is selection bias with the companies I work with, but virtually every product I see is a powerful blend of the digital and the physical world.\nConsider when you use the app on your phone to request an Uber, the many digital and physical-world interactions behind this experience.\nOr when you use your banking app to easily transfer funds to a friend on the other side of the world.\nOr when you track an important overnight delivery from a retailer.\nOr when you translate a printed menu written in a foreign language.\nOr when you track your fitness using your watch or engage in a Peloton workout.\nOr when you enlist the help of your veterinarian to decide if a pet’s behavior is something that might need treatment.\nOr simply to find the fastest route through traffic to your destination.\nEvery one of these examples is a blend of on-line and off-line, digital and non-digital experiences powered by technology.\nWhen I compare companies that take a holistic view of product where everything is powered by technology in order to serve customers, with those legacy companies that draw artificial lines around where they think they should apply technology, it’s easy to see the seeds of disruption.\nCan you separate the physical and digital?  Of course.  And sometimes there are domain-specific reasons to keep specialized people focused on non-digital aspects.\nBut I am seeing a growing stream of new companies, in nearly every industry, that are applying the product model to disrupt their legacy competitors.\nIn fact, I find it much more difficult to imagine a company that would not benefit from enabling technology across their offering.\nIf you want a simple heuristic, if you have a set of engineers working to build technology that helps to power your business, then I would argue that you would benefit from the product model.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/who-is-product-operating-model-for/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925969602,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Why Traditional Messaging Fails - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tBack when I was a product manager for Microsoft Office, we spent hundreds of thousands on positioning research. Messaging lived for years on store shelves, so getting it “right” was important. We thought about every word and enforced consistency, summarily dismissing changes from well-intentioned copywriters.\nToday, that messaging would fail.\nWhy? Because unless you have an eight-figure marketing budget, you must assume the first place people hear about your product is from someone someplace beyond your control.\nMessaging’s job today is to engage at least as much as inform. This requires much more concrete, bite-sized messaging that can easily be understood and conveyed by others. Facts, stories, enthusiastic quotes, ratings, explanations—not just benefits—are all essential parts of messaging because they are more authentic than claims.\nThe three most common problems I see in messaging are:\n“We’re new so people care” or “Let-me-tell-you-what-I-want-to-tell-you”. As technologists, we believe what we’ve created is great and that people care about something new and cool. At the end of the day, what people care about most is “I love it. It solved my problems. It was great.” Features and even cost become much less of a factor when you have other people as fans for proof. And no, I don’t mean case studies.\nNot tailoring messaging to customer lifecycle. All customers have a life cycle that provide different opportunities to message around acquisition, activation, retention, referral and revenue. What’s good for one often differs than what’s good for another. Too often messaging is built around just one of those areas (usually acquisition) instead of being specific to the desired behavior along another point in the customer’s lifecycle. Split-testing has made this level of messaging specificity easier.\nNot adapting messaging to audience and adoption-curve. Beyond the customer lifecycle, early adopters need different messaging than mainstream consumers. This is perhaps the biggest reason why messaging must be much more varied than ‘traditional’ marketing allows. Leave consistency for brand and positioning—messaging must adapt to where a product is on its adoption curve and what a particular audience needs to hear at a given point-in-time.\nAs you examine your messaging, here are a few basics to think about (caveat – design and presentation matter a lot which I won’t address here):\nClarity over comprehensiveness. By ‘traditional’ messaging standards, this 37Signals example looks pretty good: “Pay as you go. No long term contracts. No hidden fees. No surprises.” Lots of information in short, easy to read, rhythmic sentences. Yet the simple, clear articulation of what to expect outperformed it: “Sign-up takes less than 60 seconds. Pick a plan to get started!” Don’t overload your messaging. Keep people focused on just what they need to hear to move through that one point of conversion.\nAuthentic over authoritative. Studies proved the most easily scanable yet comprehended text is a short sentence followed by bullets. So most websites default to messaging in that format. But it has a dramatic effect on tone, that in today’s world, doesn’t differentiate or help with engagement. Take a look at Expedia vs. Kayak:\n“Why it pays to book with Expedia:\nHuge savings on Flight + Hotel vacations\nNo Expedia booking fees on flights\nMore hotels (and more deals!) in more place”\nYawn. I’m bored and probably skipped it entirely. Sounds like and looks like everyone else. Here’s Kayak’s more conversational approach:\n“We’re Completely, Entirely,…Totally Different.\nWith Kayak, you can compare hundreds of travel sites at once (that’s right, you don’t have to search 20 travel sites anymore)….oh, and Kayak is free to use.”\nKayak’s approach engages and communicates a lot about the brand. If you bothered to read it, you probably actually processed what makes them different.\nEvidence-based messaging. Different people need to hear different things to take action, but facts vs. claims are always more powerful. Mint.com does a great job of providing lots of evidence directly on their Home Page for why someone should try them: social proof, endorsements from major media, video showing the product in action (vs. just telling you what it does), a pain-point they can solve (tax time) and how they manage security. Although social proof has a lot of attention these days, the larger point is you need to show proof–not just make claims–and there are many kinds. Don’t force users to look hard for evidence that you are worthy of their attention.\nTest everything. With site analytics and split testing, the answer to what’s the best messaging should always be, “Let’s see.” Don’t try to follow a formula. What works best for one service is not necessarily the best messaging for you. Remember, the context someone sees before finally finding your ‘official’ messaging will always be different.\nFor example, which of the following do you think converted better?\n(A) “Get Free Email Updates: Join 14,752 others!” or\n(B) “Get Email Updates (it’s Free)”\nAnswer: For that site, (B) the version WITHOUT social proof outperformed those with it by over 100%! This isn’t the result most would have predicted, given today’s huge push toward social proof. But for that site, the design and presentation of social proof didn’t help. Make no assumptions. Test and trial everything. (for complete analysis: http://diythemes.com/thesis/increase-conversions-split-testing/)\nI hope this gives you a new lens through which to look at your messaging. Remember: engage your customers with what THEY want to hear and test EVERYTHING. It’s the path to more authentic messaging that moves toward conversion…messaging’s ultimate job.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/why-traditional-messaging-fails/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925956925,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Why Women Make The Best Product Managers - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tRecently I gave a keynote address to the Mind The Product Conference in London, and in that talk I wanted to illustrate, by example, the essential role that very strong product managers play for their team and their company.  Most people noticed that all six of my examples were female.  I didn’t call that out explicitly during my talk because my view is their performance speaks for itself.   But many people did ask me about the gender aspect afterwards (If you haven’t yet read that article, I hope you read it first as this article will make much more sense if you know just what traits are necessary for strong product managers).\nWhen I first started working on the keynote, I realized I had a unique perspective having had the opportunity to work with such a large number of technology product teams for over 35 years.  So I wrote a list of all the “rock star” caliber product managers I knew, and I immediately noticed that more than half my list was female. While females are 50% of the general population, it is not at all representative of the technology product manager population, or of corporate America in general.\nMy observation was in no way statistically significant, but it did beg the question if women tend to be so under-represented as product managers, why are so many of them exceptional at the job?  Is there something bigger to learn from these women?  And ultimately, should more product teams work harder to actively bring in women product managers?\nI have long held opinions on this topic, but this is the first time I’m sharing my thoughts publicly.  Let me state upfront that what follows are my personal theories about why women so often make the best product managers.  Let me also say this entire article is based on generalizations, and I personally know exceptions to each point I make below.  But I’m putting these theories out there in the hope that people find the points worth considering and discussing.\nAs a final disclaimer for those that don’t know me, I’m male.  But I think that makes it easier for me to have this discussion because if a women said the exact same things, it might appear self-serving.\nSo I hope people of all genders take this in the spirit it is given.  While I am focusing here on the advantages women bring, I strongly believe that every product manager benefits from these traits.\nTable Stakes\nJust to be clear, I believe strongly that for any product manager, male or female, to be competent, they must be smart, creative and persistent.  This is admittedly a high bar (and far too many teams suffer from the lack of a competent product manager), but I don’t see differences across gender in these aspects.\nIn this article I’m not talking about what makes a competent product manager; I’m talking about what distinguishes the competent ones from the best.\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not arguing here that these traits below make someone a better human being; I am just arguing that the product manager job in a tech company is extremely difficult, and that these skills substantially improve your ability to succeed.  It’s also important to acknowledge that sometimes the way we acquire these skills or traits is not through positive and constructive coaching from a skilled manager or mentor, but rather through very painful lessons learned.\nBalanced Ego\nIn my view, the absolute biggest advantage women have stems from having a well-balanced ego.  I’ll define that as someone being confident yet modest.  It is the rare woman who is over-confident. Even someone as famously accomplished as Sheryl Sandberg didn’t assume she was the smartest person in the room (even when she clearly was). Confidence is a necessary ingredient for success, but it is most effective when it doesn’t drift towards arrogance, or an over-inflated belief in one’s point-of-view.\nOne of the main reasons I see otherwise capable product managers fail is due to ego.  So much depends on the relationship of the product manager with the other members of the team, and especially with the alpha leaders of the company.  It is essential for product managers to not take disagreement as a personal affront.\nThe balanced egos many women possess let them hear what’s being said without it reflecting as a challenge to themselves. This lets them work effectively with even the alpha males.  This balanced sense of self also shows up as women being much more likely to give credit to the team when things go well, yet take the blame on themselves when things go poorly.\nAs an example of what I mean here, for each of the six women I highlighted, in every case, their only real hesitation was that readers of my article might not give enough credit to their team.\nEmotional Intelligence\nIn a recent article about Lady Catherine Ashton’s crucial role in negotiating Iran halting development of its nuclear program, emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to both identify and manage one’s own emotions, pick up on the emotions of others, manage them and, in so doing, build trust, grow influence and achieve better outcomes all round.\nIt’s not one skill, as much as many skills deployed to navigate people and situations of all types, from brilliant but sometimes dogmatic engineers, to passionate designers, to executives that might be genuinely fearful of, or threatened by, technology, to angry customers, and the many people that just don’t like change.\nThis emotional intelligence allows the product manager to engage constructively with each of these people, actually listening closely enough to identify the underlying issues and constraints the person is trying to express, and working creatively to find solutions that work for the various parties involved.\nSo much about the product role boils down to navigating the complexities of people and constraints to come up solutions that work for customers and work for your company.  It’s hard to do this consistently without serious emotional intelligence skills.\nHumility\nYou could argue that being humble is a consequence of having a balanced ego, but I think it goes further than that.  I would argue that to be a strong product manager, you need to consistently question yourself and your decisions.  The truth is we’re all very often wrong.  Good product managers get that, and are comfortable with that.  They even embrace it.\nSo often with males, I find them taking it personally when they’re wrong on something.  Women seem to be much better at separating their personal self-worth, from whether or not particular ideas turn out to work well with customers.  This mindset and attitude rubs off on the whole product team, and I believe is a necessary ingredient for consistent innovation.\nRelated to this, or maybe because of this, I find that women product managers take self-improvement seriously.  Women more naturally bring a growth mindset. In my coaching sessions with women, they tend to be so much more productive because we can talk openly about weaknesses and how to tackle them.  All too often I struggle to convince the male product manager that they have a weakness we need to work on.\nStamina\nAnyone that has ever been involved in technology product efforts, especially in larger companies, knows that they are their own sort of marathons.\nTo be able to persist for months and usually years, constantly evangelizing, inspiring, problem solving, handling people with difficult personalities at every level of the company, dealing with those that resist change; this takes a special level of stamina. It requires a form of patience, but definitely not acquiescence.  Male product managers very often get so frustrated with the sheer duration of the struggle that they eventually lose their composure.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s frustrating for all of us, it’s just that I find that women can typically persist much longer.\nSo this is my theory as to why I see a disproportionate number of very successful technology product managers that are female.  A balanced ego, strong emotional intelligence, humility, and extraordinary stamina.\nHiring Women Product Managers\nIf you agree with my reasoning, then there’s one very important consequence of all this that you’ll need to be cognizant of: you need to find ways to encourage more women to apply to product management jobs, even if they haven’t done it before.\nI can’t tell you how many companies complain to me that they want more women as product managers, but simply not enough women apply for the product jobs.\nHere’s the thing: if you post a job for a product manager, many exceptionally qualified women will not actually think they’re qualified, and they won’t apply.\nFor example, if your job description asks for 4 years of technology industry experience, then as a general rule, a man will apply if he has at least 1 year, but a woman will only apply if she has at least 5 years.  You may think I’m exaggerating on this but I’m really not.\nPart of the problem is the job description itself.  Many people have obsolete or overly simplistic beliefs about what is required.  A degree in computer science is not required.  Good understanding of technology and how to apply it to solve problems is required.  An MBA is not required.  Good understanding of the workings of business is required.  Go take a look at the LinkedIn profiles of the six women I highlighted.\nI’ve found that I have to actually go and personally approach the women I think are especially well-suited for the product manager job, and explain to them that they really need to apply, and that they should please trust me, that I’m really good at spotting talent, and the fact that they are not sure they’re prepared for the job, is part of what makes them so good.\nThe best women product managers are often those who never thought about doing the job, but are natural fits by how they think, work and act. Find them. Actively recruit them into the discipline. Train and invest in them. Your product teams, your company, and ultimately the entire tech industry will be the better for it.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/why-women-make-the-best-product-managers/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925972946,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Women in Product - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tNote 1: I’m focusing in this article on women, however, my points here are intended to apply to all under-represented groups.\nNote 2: I am highlighting here the product role, which is a subset of the “women in tech” topic.  I would also love to see more women in engineering and design roles, but I am especially focused on the product role because it’s such a strong path to CEO and GM roles.\nI still remember the first time I personally witnessed gender-based discrimination in the tech workplace.\nI was a young engineering manager at HP, and during one of the quarterly meetings where we’d stack rank everyone across the different parts of the organization, there was a discussion comparing the performance of two people, one male and one female.  One of the senior managers made the argument that the male should get ranked higher because he had a family to support, the implication being that the female he was being compared to did not.  I remember thinking that even if this was something that should be considered, she could very possibly be a single head of household, so that didn’t make much sense to me.  But I didn’t know either person being considered, and I was new to this whole management thing, so regrettably I didn’t say anything.\nToday I rarely see such overt discrimination, at least when it comes to sexism.  It still exists; it’s just more subtle, and I’ve come to believe that much of it today is not intentional.  But even though active discrimination may be less prevalent, the legacy it has created persists.\nIt hit me recently that it’s one thing to not be a sexist or racist, but it’s another thing to be actively anti-sexist or anti-racist.\nWhile I like to believe I’m not a sexist or racist, at least not intentionally or consciously, what have I really done to actively combat sexism or racism?\nIt’s one thing to not intentionally discriminate against women, and it’s another to actively work to reverse the legacy of that discrimination.\nI was inspired recently by my friends that put on the Craft Conference in Budapest.  I consider this one of the best new conferences for software engineers, and last year they had a very visible policy of non-discrimination, but this year they went further and offered “diversity scholarships” to try to actively increase the representation from under-represented groups.\nTo me, that’s an example of not just having a policy against discrimination, but proactively working for meaningful change.\nThere are many things I think we can all to do to actively work to correct these imbalances and inequities.  Here are some examples:\n– When you recruit, don’t just prioritize resumes of under-represented groups, but go out and figure out how to increase the pool entering your funnel.\n– Make sure every member of your team is able to contribute from a safe place.  If you don’t know what I mean by this, check out the recent article describing how significant this factor is.\n– If you see harassment or discrimination taking place, call it out – it diminishes us all.\nFor myself, going forward, I’m committing to doing more than just not discriminating:\n– I have already begun to actively work to change the image people have in their mind when they picture a strong, smart, hard-working product manager.\n– I’m now offering several scholarship spots in my public workshops to try to remove the financial barriers for women and other under-represented groups.\n– Finally, as I encounter these smart and ambitious people, I am going to try to personally make sure they get placed in a good product company working under a proven product leader that can help them reach their potential.\nAnd I’ll continue to seek out other ways I can use my platform in the technology community to help.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/women-in-product/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925894744,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Working From Home - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Management\n\tMarch 12, 2020\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tCertainly there are disadvantages to being physically separated from your colleagues, and those are well known, but in this article, I’d like to focus on the potential advantages of working from home (WFH), and encourage you to make the most of this situation.\nMost product managers complain to me that their biggest struggle is to find quality time to work on many of the most important yet most time-consuming aspects of their job.  Well, now you might have that time.\nThere is a big caveat to the suggestions below.  Many people that have found themselves in a WFH situation, have also found themselves needing to serve as full or part-time childcare, or home-school teacher, or other family obligations, and these people can struggle to get even a solid hour of work in during the day.  So these suggestions are obviously not intended for these people.\nIf you are a product manager, and you are finding yourself with some significant time on your hands, I’ve got ten suggestions for you.  Maybe you’ll only have time for one or maybe you’ll be able to do all ten.  But I can say that when you do return to your team, you can be a much more valuable contributor:\n Pick the most important key decision that your team is facing, and do some real thinking and write up a written narrative. Then iterate on this narrative with your designer, tech lead, and your manager until it is solid.  This is one of the most impactful things you can do to develop as a product manager and product leader. \n Do an analysis of your product strategy, or if you don’t have one, propose one.  I have just recently published a series of articles on the importance of a strong and thoughtful product strategy, and I also pointed out how most teams don’t actually have a product strategy.  I strongly suggest writing this strategy up in a written narrative form as well.\n Do a deep dive on your data.  You are looking to build understanding, and to identify insights.  You may need to ask questions of your data analyst, but that can work fine as you and your data analyst are working from home.  Focus on three perspectives on the data: how your customers are interacting with your product; how that interaction is changing over time; and the financial data about your product.  Make sure you have a clear and deep understanding of the various KPIs that describe your product’s health.\n Improve your qualitative understanding of how your users and customers engage with and react to your product.  Reach out to your user research team. Ask for them to share as much of the learnings as they can with you. Ask them questions about their findings and opinions.  You’re not just looking for their assessment of your product, you’re also looking for what they think are missed opportunities.\n Investigate potential enabling technologies.  Machine learning alone should keep you busy, but there’s still much to be learned regarding mobile, especially as it’s used in much of Asia, big data, or augmented reality.  Discuss your findings with your tech lead. The question you are trying to answer is: is there new technology that would allow us to solve long-standing problems for our customers in ways that are just now possible?\n Do a deep dive on your industry and the competitive landscape.  Study Stratechery’s Aggregation Theory and Disruption Theory and consider how these apply to your product and your industry.  Write up your findings and thoughts in a written narrative. Do an analysis of the potential disruptors in your industry.  What are the things that you think each competitor does well and what do you think they are each missing? \n Use the opportunity to take a fresh and in-depth look at your customers.  Arrange a series of 15-30 video calls – they may be working from home as well – and talk with them about their experiences.  You’re not looking to hear how much they love you; you’re looking for the things that you’re not doing for them. Write up your thoughts in a written narrative.\n Pick one of your most important stakeholders – finance, legal, privacy, sales or marketing are all good examples – and do a deep dive to learn as much as you can about their area.  Write up an FAQ of what you think the most difficult questions and concerns would be from that stakeholder’s perspective, and then craft thoughtful, evidence-based written responses. Discuss your FAQ with that stakeholder.  Your goal is to raise your knowledge level in this area so substantially that this key stakeholder begins to consider you as a true colleague in addressing their very real challenges.\n Do a self-assessment of your skills and then craft your own improvement plan.  If your manager is willing to do this with you even better, but I have seen many people make real strides in their own abilities by a) being honest with themselves about their weaknesses; and b) taking seriously the effort to improve.\n Take the time to read some inspiring and relevant books.  There are many really good ones out there, and you can always ask me for more.  Here’s a few good ones:\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things\nWhat You Do Is Who You Are\nLeaders Eat Last\nCreativity Inc.\nSo as you can see there’s a great deal that can be done with any time that is freed up while working from home.  I hope you can make the most of this situation, and above all, wishing that you and yours stay safe and healthy.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Management\n\tJanuary 30, 2024\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Management Theater\n\t\n\tFair warning that for many of you, this article is going to feel like a heavy dose of tough love....\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Management\n\tDecember 19, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Predictions 2024\n\t\n\tRecently I was invited by Productboard to give a talk on the topic of what 2024 might have in store...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct Management\n\tJune 21, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tPledge To Stakeholders\n\t\n\tNote: As a company moves from stakeholder-driven feature teams to empowered product teams, there are some fairly significant changes to...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/working-from-home/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925974123,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"You're Not Helping - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tMost of my writing is aimed at the product organization, and in helping that organization evolve to where it needs to be to truly serve the needs of the company.    I have also written about how the leaders of the company can help facilitate this.  This article, however, is aimed at those leaders that are not actually helping, even though their intentions are typically good.\nSo here are what I would list as the top 10 behaviors in which leaders aren’t actually helping:\n1.  Drive-by Management.  Also known as “swoop and poop.”  This is the typically extremely busy leader that drops in occasionally (every few days or weeks) and does a harried brain-dump of all the ideas or frustrations he’s saved up since the last time he came by.  The issue here isn’t so much the frequency of interaction, it’s the nature of the interaction.  It’s typically very one-way and demoralizing.  Instead, try changing the nature of your interaction to discuss what the team has learned since the last visit, what experiments have you tried and what are you intending to try next.\n2. Micro-Managing.  This is a tough one for so many product leaders, as they typically really do want their teams to step up and they want to empower them, but the leader may not feel the team is ready or able to step up.  Unfortunately, this quickly becomes self-fulfilling, as a micro-managed team quickly becomes disempowered and comes to the conclusion they should just wait for instructions.  My view is that you need to make sure you have people in your product organization you can entrust, and then you need to empower them and hold them accountable.  The alternative just doesn’t scale and doesn’t yield the type of motivation necessary for sustained product efforts.\n3. Customer Control.  Some leaders think that they must control all access to the customers and prospects, either because they feel that’s their job, or because they don’t trust the product people not to say something inappropriate, or that the product people should stay with the team working on building the product.  However, unless the product team can establish itself as the experts on the customer, the products will never be where they need to be.  And if you really can’t trust the product team to know how to behave in front of customers, then you need to get people there that you can trust.   Or send your product managers to “Charm School.”\n4. Bright Shiny Thing.  It is normal for those of us that love this industry and technology to frequently get excited about new opportunities and new technologies, but we’ve all seen the leader that changes his mind every few weeks on what the “next big thing” is going to be.  As the leader, you do have some silver bullets to be used when a truly big opportunity does come along, but you only have a few, because once you’ve done that too many times, it’s like the boy that cried wolf.  The team learns to not really pay much attention because they know you’ll change your mind again in a few weeks.\n5. Last Customer Visited.  A problem commonly associated with Drive-by Management and Customer Control, is the leader that completely guard rails after each customer visit.  They get called into a customer that is having big issues, and then they come back and want to change everything based on that customer’s issues, which lasts until the next time this happens.  In my experience, this is most commonly a problem when the leader only visits customers occasionally rather than frequently, and is a bigger problem at enterprise companies.\n6. Confused Business Strategy.  Very often the product team is thrashing because they either don’t understand the business strategy because it hasn’t been clearly articulated, or because the business strategy keeps changing on them.  A business strategy typically has a profound effect on the product, so clarity around this is one of the key responsibilities of the leadership.  The head of product may need to help the leaders to articulate this strategy, but the leaders must own it.\n7. Acquisitions without Product Due Diligence.  Leaders often get very excited about potential acquisitions, and they know they must do financial due diligence, but often they forget the product due diligence.  Everyone in our industry knows how low the success rate is of mergers and acquisitions, yet it’s amazing to me how few are willing to do a post-mortem as to what they could have done differently to have achieved a better outcome.  You can go a long ways towards helping by including product (and technology) due diligence.\n8. Confusing Risk Aversion with Risk Mitigation.  When companies are just starting out this is usually not so much of a problem because you don’t have much to lose, and you’re all just doing everything you can to find that product/market fit.  However, once some measure of success has been achieved, it’s normal for the organization to move into the mode of trying to protect what they have rather than continuing to move aggressively forward.  Risk aversion is when you’re scared to take the risks you need to in order to move forward.  However, it’s the job of the product organization to mitigate those risks so that you can continue to experiment and learn without putting the existing business at risk.\n9. Engineers and Sales People.  There are a surprising number of leaders out there that still believe deep down that the only people that really matter are engineers (to write the code) and sales people (to sell the product), and the rest of the organization is essentially overhead.  Old beliefs die hard.  However, even if this is what you believe, by all means don’t ever say so out loud.  You will demoralize the team and likely lose the very people that your company depends on for its future.\n10. Demonstrating You Care.  As my friend Danny Shader says, the organization cares about what the leader cares about.  If the leader doesn’t demonstrate every day that he cares about your customers and your product, then the organization won’t either.  Do something every day to demonstrate this caring.\nI want to thank a product manager that I know for his suggestion of this topic and the title.  I’m not naming him here just in case his CEO sees this article \n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/youre-not-helping/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925972008,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Your Business Plan is Wrong - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\tIn my last article on “Lessons From the VC Industry” I included some thoughts suggested by a VC friend of mine, Josh Kopelman of First Round Capital.  In his thoughts he shared with me he had another insight that I didn’t include because I thought it was so important and fundamental that I wanted to dedicate an article to this topic.\nHere’s Josh in his own words:\n“Most venture capitalists see several thousand business plans a year – and the one thing they all have in common is that they all are wrong.  The moment an entrepreneur hits save, print or send, the plan is out of date.  Competition, Technology, and Market Dynamics all effect the plan.  Most successful entrepreneurs understand that they need to “pivot” as they get additional data and learning.  Many successful venture-backed businesses are “pivots” – PayPal started as a technology to send money from PDA’s, and YouTube started as a dating site.”\nJosh went on to emphasize how VC’s understand this dynamic and encourage it, yet product companies seem to fight or deny this reality.\nConsider how much weight a typical product company puts on the business plan for their proposed projects.  It’s not unusual for product companies to require detailed projected ROI or ECV analysis, market projections, and/or granular cost estimates.   And senior management makes investment decisions based on these plans and estimates.\nWhile good VC’s assume these plans are wrong, product companies not only assume they are reasonably accurate and base decisions on them, but  then they make the process of change painful and expensive.  A pivot is generally not something that is encouraged or even welcomed.\nIt’s no surprise to me that so many product companies complain of lack of innovation.  In large part, the innovations and big insights result from these pivots.\nThis is why I focus on the broad concept of “Product Discovery” rather than the very narrow “Requirements Specification” that most people associate with product definition.  Discovery by its nature must be open to these pivots and course corrections.\n(By the way, have you noticed that with every additional word of specification documentation you put down, you become less open to new ideas and different approaches?  This is why it’s so important to hold off on writing anything up until after you’ve discovered something worth describing in a spec.)\nI do think there are two important flavors of discovery, and I’ve written earlier about the distinction between market discovery and product discovery.\nFor many product companies, especially startups, the real objective is just to find some product that resonates with a market.  Marc Andressen calls this “product/market fit”.   This might mean discovering a new market, but most of the time it means discovering a product solution that does the job better for existing markets.\nOnce a company is more established, very often the company has a specific need, and the purpose of product discovery is to try to find a product that meets the specific need.  For example, maybe your company depends on a mobile payment solution, but you don’t yet know what that mobile payment solution looks like.  Product discovery is meant to figure that out by coming up with a solution that is valuable, usable and feasible.\nSo when Josh says that all business plans are wrong, this has big implications for both product portfolio planning, and for product discovery.\nFor product portfolio planning, we need to pay much less attention to the specific numbers in the business plan, which are very likely wrong, and more attention to the team, the opportunity and the process of discovery.\nSometimes when I explain this to people they think I just don’t like the models or the spreadsheets.  But the models are typically fine; the issue is that at the very early stage that most companies create these models, there’s just no way to know the idea’s potential in terms of real customer demand, whether the team can discover a solution that meets the needs, and the eventual cost to build and deliver this solution.  So it’s garbage in, garbage out.\nA critical part of good product portfolio planning is acknowledging what you can know, and what you can’t, and managing risk intelligently.\nFor product discovery, we need to realize that it’s not only okay to seek out these pivots, this is what product discovery is all about.\nBy the way, you can read more of Josh’s thoughts on his blog at www.redeyevc.com.\n\t\n\t","url":"https://www.svpg.com/your-business-plan-is-wrong/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925840674,"host":"www.svpg.com","page_title":"Youth versus Experience - Silicon Valley Product Group","text":"\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tIf you have been wondering what’s going on with all these startups with 20-something founders and product leaders, you’re not alone. There are some great companies that have been started by some very young people, several of whom dropped out of college to pursue their ideas. I’ve talked earlier about the value of experience, but in this note I’d like to talk about the problem I see of people discounting product leaders because of their youth.\nIn truth, I think there are outstanding product leaders across the age spectrum. But how is it that someone can be only 25 years old and an exceptional product leader? First, remember that the Internet has really only been around since 1995 or so, so anyone who today is 24 or older probably has about the same amount of experience online as the rest of us. And people that were in their teens during the rise of the Internet grew up taking for granted technologies that many are still trying to figure out. Further, while experience can play an important role and naturally develops over time, other traits like innate intelligence and product passion are not a function of our chronological age.\nI personally had to get used to the idea of working for someone in their early 20’s when I worked for Marc Andreessen at Netscape. But I quickly forgot about how old he was once I started seeing how quickly he was absorbing the new technologies and assimilating the literally thousands of customer visits he was doing. Anyone just listening to him would assume he was at least in his 40’s.\nBut what this is really about is finding great product people – regardless of their age, gender or race. I’m not here to talk about the moral issues involved in the different forms of discrimination, but I do want to talk about the business issues. I believe there are still stereotypes and biases that get in the way of companies creating the best product teams and products possible. In his new book “Blink” Malcolm Gladwell makes a similar point (among several other very useful points for product managers).\nOne reason I love the Bay Area so much is because we’re so diverse. At the typical Silicon Valley tech company, within a single product team you’ll typically find males and females, straight and gay, Caucasian, Chinese, Indian, and Russian. But even in the most progressive of companies I think there are often hiring biases based on our mental image of a great product leader. For example, we know that communication skills are essential for a strong product manager, so we sometimes look for someone with native English language skills, even though others that may be much stronger have more than passable language skills.\nI point this out not to chastise anyone but just to try to make us aware that we might be missing some truly outstanding product leaders by unintentionally restricting our view of what makes a great product manager and where great product ideas come from. So the next time that 22 year old college hire comes to you with a product idea, you may want to listen. Her idea might be the next Facebook.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tfeatured content\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tTransformed FAQ\n\t\n\tThis page is here to hold questions and answers that come up once the TRANSFORMED book is published and we...\n\tarticle\n\tread more\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tProduct\n\tNovember 28, 2023\n\tMarty Cagan\n\t\n\t\n\tAlternatives To Product Managers\n\t\n\tI doubt anyone is surprised to learn that many people have been asking me about Brian Chesky’s recent comments.
