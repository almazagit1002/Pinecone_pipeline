But knowing the right questions to ask during customer conversations and win-loss interviews takes a lot of practice and a healthy dose of curiosity.\nHere are ten open-ended customer interview questions I have in my arsenal that have worked well for me over the years when engaging with prospects and customers on products including ProductPlan. Asking a few of these questions can make a difference in the features you decide to include on your product roadmap.\nDownload My Customer Interview Tool Box ➜\n1. Why?\nThis is by far the most powerful question you can ask, so ask it often. Product managers should rarely accept a customer’s initial response; promptly moving onto the next point without pressing further can cheat your own understanding. By asking “why” as a follow-up question you can often extract a more enlightening response and get to the crux of their issue. For example, when I interviewed people about the product concept that became Citrix GoToMyPC we spent less time talking about remote access features and more time asking why their life would be better with our solution. As a result, we uncovered a stronger value proposition for the product.\n2. How do you do that today?\nThis is a great question when a customer asks you for a specific feature. Rather than taking their feature request at face value, dig in to really understand how they are accomplishing the job today. If you can, have them show you their process or how they are using their current product. This line of questioning proved particularly useful for ProductPlan when we interviewed product managers to understand how they were building and communicating their product roadmap.\n3. How do you know you’ve had a successful year/month/day?\nThis is a valuable question for business products where you are trying to uncover metrics and customer goals. If your product can help your customers achieve their goals or help make them more successful, you are well on your way to a valuable product.\n4. How do you feel about your current solution?\nThis one is good for understanding opportunities to differentiate your product from competitors, especially during win-loss interviews. A good follow-up question might be “Where does your current solution provide the most benefit? What do you like best about it?” These questions make it clear that you are searching for opportunities to understand the motivations behind their choice; not judge the chosen solution.\n5. What is the most frustrating thing about your current solution?\nThis is a multi-purpose, open-ended question that you can use to open up the conversation flow and to discover pain points. If the solution you are validating doesn’t solve a real pain point, it might not be valuable enough for your target users.\n6. What do you wish you could do that you can’t do today?\nThis is a variation on the “If you could wave a magic wand…” question asked by many product managers. I’ve found that questions like these work well for very specific features or use cases. Be careful about asking this question in too general a fashion or too early, as it can lead to ambiguous results or a blank stare.\n7. How would your day/job/task be different if you had this?\nI use variations of this question depending on the circumstances, but the objective is the same: understanding how your solution or feature solves a problem and what type of value a customer would place on solving that problem.\nDownload the Customer-Centricity Checklist ➜\n8. Can you give me an example?\nThis is another great general-purpose question that can give you a goldmine of supporting evidence for your new product or feature. In customer interviews, especially for early-stage market validation, it can be easy for conversations to stay high level. Asking for specific examples lets your interviewee know that you are willing to dive into the details, which will provide you with much more information than a higher-level discussion.\n9. If this were available today, would you buy/use it?\nThis question in itself may not result in an accurate answer (and can often lead to false positives). It’s what you do after this question that counts: Ask this question and then be quiet. Listening to their response for 60 seconds can give you insight into their decision process and the value they place on your product or feature. Make sure to follow-up with detailed questions such as “Would you walk me through the purchase process?”\n10. Why would you recommend our solution to others?\nYou can use variations of this “ultimate question” to gauge satisfaction with your solution and then ask follow-up questions.\nTry a few of these questions with customers or prospects during your next interviews. Some are better suited for new product development, but most will work well for your ongoing feature validation and win-loss interviews. Of course, great questions aren’t worth much unless you listen closely, read between the lines and then ask deeper follow-up questions.\nIf you’re interested in more information on customer interviews, check out our Customer Interview Tool Box.

In this series, I’m writing about SaaS pricing lessons I’ve learned from launching several SaaS products including GoToMeeting, AppFolio, and ProductPlan.\nIn the first part of our series, we reviewed why pricing based on customer value is key to a great product strategy. In the second part, I described how SaaS gives product managers flexibility to be creative with pricing models. We cover the art of subscription pricing in our webinar below:\nHere are 10 tips for how to price your SaaS product that you can use. While many of these apply to SaaS products, the lessons overall apply to software product pricing in general.\nRead the Power of SaaS Pricing Experiments ➜\n10 Lessons for Pricing SaaS Products\nPricing must be a part of early validation. While you may not nail your final pricing until later, the earlier you can zone in on your SaaS pricing model, the better off you will be. This gives you a greater chance of building your pricing model into the value proposition. At a minimum, during the product conceptualization stage, actively interview potential decision-makers about their purchase process, how they purchased their current solution, and frustrations with the current solution’s pricing.\nBallpark LTV as early as possible. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is so critical to a SaaS business model that you need to estimate it as early as possible – well before you have customers and revenue. LTV influences the sales model and what you can afford to spend to acquire customers. While there are lots of ways to calculate LTV, I recommend keeping it as a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation with input from customer interviews and similar products.\nLTV > CAC. The formula for success is simple in the SaaS world: LTV overtime must be significantly greater than customer acquisition cost (CAC). SaaS companies with a recurring revenue stream like Salesforce.com have LTV multiples that are three to five times the cost to acquire that customer. Doing back-of-the-envelope calculations on CAC will help you avoid surprises down the road.\nYour sales model influences your pricing. Conversely, SaaS pricing constrains the sales model options available to you. For example, if you have an expensive field sales force, you need to ensure that your customer LTV is high enough to support that model. You’ll struggle if your average customer purchases $50/month over a two-year lifetime. Ultimately, your buyer persona determines your sales model, so make sure you understand the expected purchase process.\nCreate upsell opportunities within your pricing model. One of the advantages of SaaS is the ability to offer upgrades and services that drive additional revenue. Consider these within your SaaS pricing model, as they can make a substantial difference in long-term product revenue. This is the model we used with great success at AppFolio.\nUse caution when offering annual prepurchase discounts. Many SaaS products that license on a monthly basis will offer a discount for annual prepurchasing. However, with SaaS pricing, use this with discretion. Analysis shows that over the long term, you leave significant revenue on the table.\nConsider free trials. If your acquisition and activation model is simple enough, providing a limited free trial is a great way to increase your sales conversions. It’s common to offer 15- and 30-day trial options.\nService is key. Because SaaS is typically licensed as a subscription, your customers are at risk of churning every renewal period. Service and support are even more critical than with traditional software. For this reason, many SaaS products build support and regular upgrades into the standard licensing fee. Consider whether your customers will be receptive to additional fees for support and maintenance for a product that they expect to work flawlessly.\nCustomers don’t care about your costs. I’m not suggesting you ignore your costs, but don’t price your product working backward from cost. This is not how your customers will think about the pricing. Sure, the cost of goods sold needs to be a factor for you to be viable, but this is not related to how customers value your product.\nPricing perception doesn’t follow economic rules. Customers often buy products for reasons that seem disconnected from the Return on Investment calculation. Pricing, specifically SaaS pricing, is highly psychological. For this reason, the demand curve is not linear – a lower price doesn’t necessarily equate to more customers and revenue. Take this into account by thoroughly understanding the qualitative value that your product provides.\nTakeaways\nWith web-based SaaS products, it’s easier than ever to conduct A/B tests to gauge buyer behavior, pricing, and acquisition costs (before and after launch). As you test the user interface, I encourage you to test your pricing with equal fervor.\nUse qualitative customer interviews to get enough data points to make good decisions. Get it right for SaaS pricing, and you have a recurring revenue stream that places your product’s portfolio value well above traditional software products.\nPragmatic Marketing Webinar: Missed Jim Semick from ProductPlan for the Pragmatic Marketing Webinar?

Predictions about future trends are tricky because of the uncertainty of them coming to pass. Lists of trends that survey the past should be easier by definition, right? After all, what’s happened has happened. Let’s look at some of the biggest trends we identified in 2022.\nTrends (still) impacting the newly converted\nOrganizations that have more recently recognized the importance of product management to the success of their business are those that are transitioning from being “sales-led” or “customer-led” to “product-led.”\nAgile vs. agile\n“Are you Agile, or are you agile?” Adopting Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, eXtreme Programming, or some combination of the above has been a trend, or some might say a craze, affecting digital product management for many years. The process has been going on long enough to spawn backlashes proclaiming its demise. As others have said, the idea that Agile methodologies are a thing of the past is a gross exaggeration. Still, the problem that this discussion raises is a real one with which many organizations continue to struggle.\nAt issue is the difference between Agile (capital “A”) methodologies and an agile (small “a”) mindset. Yet many organizations continue to jump head-first into the adoption of Agile practices. And they do this without an understanding of why these practices work. Organizations that fail at Agile practice adoption often haven’t taken the time to embrace the agile mindset.\nUnfortunately, this trend is likely to be with us for a while. Fortunately, many companies do eventually get through botched implementations and false starts. Failure is a great teacher.\nDownload the Product Planning Workbook➜\nData-driven decision-making\nAnother persistent trend is the continued growth of an appreciation for grounding decisions in data – both quantitative and qualitative. This trend has supported the emergence of the Data Product Manager as a role on the product team dedicated to the process of collecting, organizing, storing, and sharing data within an organization. At the time of writing this post, there were 525 postings on LinkedIn for positions in the U.S. with this focus. When broadening the scope to include data scientists and data analysts, who often work closely with product managers to answer questions with data, the open positions swell to almost 7,000.\nOutcome-driven vs. feature-based roadmaps\nIf you are unfamiliar with the difference between these two types of roadmaps and why it matters, let’s quickly unpack that. They showed a list of features on a release timeline: this quarter, we will ship features a, b, and c. The next quarter will feature d, e, and f. There are several problems with this type of roadmap:\nFeature-based roadmaps are often inaccurate because forecasting the completion date for a new feature is imprecise.\nThey don’t typically reflect the reasons why any feature ships.\nLittle attention is paid to whether the shipment of a specific feature led to a profitable outcome. The act of shipping a feature is celebrated rather than the achievement of a measurable result.\nOn the other hand, outcome-driven roadmaps are very different. They focus on the results that the team is looking for. Either way, they recognize that the product changes are more hypotheses than guarantees. Moreover, they embrace the uncertainty of the timeline. Finally, they accept the agile (small “a”) reality that priorities change.\nIn full disclosure, placing this trend on the list of those affecting organizations early in their product management journey reflects a bit of a bias to which some may object. The bias is based on the judgment that those still using feature-based roadmaps fall low on the product management maturity scale. Although some companies have been on their product management journey for many years and still use feature-based roadmaps, their reluctance to accept the limitations of this approach and embrace an outcome-driven approach is holding them back.\nTrends for product management leaders\nWhile the list of trends above is relevant to those who are further along their product management journey, they are no longer top of mind. Whichever side of the ongoing debates these organizations fall on, the companies in this group have picked a position and are now looking at a different set of concerns.\nOptimizing data pipelines\nProduct Ops: hero or villain?\nThe extent and limits of product management authority\nA warehouse-first approach to data\nThe next step after recognizing and embracing the importance of using data throughout the organization is to figure out how to deal with the pitfalls many companies fall into when they first embrace data-driven decision-making. As many product managers learn, it’s not enough to have the data; you have to be able to put it to use. The inability to perform analyses that require combining account data with usage data is a frustrating roadblock. Learning about an incompatibility between systems initially chosen as point solutions is a common facepalm moment as product leaders mature in their organizational data requirements.\nOne solution to this problem that is growing in popularity is to take a “warehouse-first” approach to data collection. In other words, the data warehouse is the source of truth and the central node in the data pipeline strategy. Account, app usage, clickstream, and marketing data are all stored in a data warehouse where it is cleansed and transformed as necessary before being pushed out to other tools like marketing automation.\nThe advantages of a warehouse-first approach to data are compelling, especially considering the ability to avoid vendor lock-in resulting from key data being imprisoned in a proprietary database. The challenges, however, are also significant. Key pieces of the puzzle are lacking, so you may need to adopt a hybrid approach until the tool you need supports the ability to ingest data from an external source. In other cases, the tools exist, but issues can arise for those handling healthcare or other sensitive data that cannot leave the U.S. due to regulatory restrictions. If you find yourself looking into the tools available, be sure to verify whether the vendor can guarantee HIPAA or other relevant compliance before going too deep on an evaluation.\nProduct Ops: hero or villain?\nIn February 2022, product management author, blogger, consultant, and pundit Marty Cagan lit up product management discussion groups and Slack channels with his post, “Product Ops Overview.” In this controversial post, Cagan identified six distinct definitions of the Product Ops role that he describes as “most damaging, to most valuable.”\nReincarnated PMO Model\nTwo-in-a-Box PM Model\nDelegated Product Leader Model\nProduct Operations Rebranded Model\nProduct Marketing Manager Rebranded Model\nForce Multiplier Model\nThe post generated controversy because his opinions hit close to home for many people. The Product Ops role has been proliferating on product-related job boards for several years, and it has solved a lot of problems for a lot of organizations. Cagan would likely argue that those problems arose from more fundamental problems in product management practices. Regardless, the debate over the role of Product Ops within a product management organization is not over.\nDownload Scaling Product Teams with Product Operations➜\nThe extent and limits of product management authority\nA popular product management book on product leaders bookshelves is Influence Without Authority by Allan R. Cohen and David L. Bradford. This book describes how to use an understanding of what motivates others to achieve mutually beneficial agreements when the ability to control the actions of others through managerial edict doesn’t exist.\nThe idea that a good product manager is the CEO of the product was first articulated more than 20 years ago by Ben Horowitz in his memo, “Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager.” Horowitz has since added a disclaimer to the top of the document, possibly because of the backlash over some people taking his original concept, that a “good product manager takes full responsibility and measures themselves in terms of the success of the product,” to an unintended extreme. Some product managers have used this statement to assume authority where none exists.\nEmpowered product teams, another of Cagan’s contributions, are essentially the antithesis of feature teams. The latter is given a list of features and enhancements to implement that are defined and prioritized by stakeholders outside the product team. The former is given problems to solve and trusted to discover, design, build, and implement solutions that solve those problems.\nNone of these concepts are new to 2022, but the discussion is alive and well. At the heart of the debate are challenging decisions about how an organization will be run. As product management teams mature from infancy through growing pains associated with company expansion and possibly bumpy roads, these decisions are inevitably revisited.\nTrends on everyone’s mind\nRegardless of where you are on the product management maturity scale, there’s a good chance you spent some part of 2022 considering one of these topics:\nThe impact of artificial intelligence\nObjectives & key results\nThe great talent shortage\nThe impact of artificial intelligence\nOn the mind of virtually every digital product manager with enough capacity to think ahead a few steps is the question of how artificial intelligence plays into their product strategy. For some, of course, this question is not one for “someday” but for “right now.” The financial product manager who is not at least thinking about how they can leverage AI today is probably already falling behind in the market.\nAI impacts all stages of the product lifecycle, from design to development and testing to marketing to customer service and support. If you’re not considering how AI will affect how to design, build, market, or operate your product, you can bet your competitors or future disrupters are.\nObjectives & key results (OKRs)\nIs there anyone who hasn’t at least dabbled with OKRs yet? This organizational management methodology has been around for decades but has exploded in recent years into one of those “everyone’s doing it” trends. Seemingly every unicorn in Silicon Valley and beyond, not to mention the largest and most successful companies in the world (Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Adobe, Intel, Amazon, Dell, GE), have embraced OKRs to align their people around the corporate strategy. A well-executed OKR implementation promises not just to get everyone in the company paddling in the same direction but also to increase morale and retention by helping every member of the team to understand how their day-to-day work supports the big, strategic goals.\nThe great talent shortage\nFinally, a growing appreciation for the importance of solid product management has combined with an expansion in the overall jobs market to add product manager to the list of roles that are difficult to fill, along with product designer, software developer, and many others. The candidate shortage has contributed to a rise in wages which has made the ease of changing positions in search of higher pay more common, so positions are difficult not just to fill but to keep filled.\nLearn how to transform your product launches from chaos to success➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/2022-product-management-trend/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925757303,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"3 Questions to Ask About Every Potential Product Feature","text":"\n If you’re a product manager, then you know that demands for new features come from all directions.\nSometimes these demands come from key customers asking for a specific feature to support a workflow unique to them. Other times they might come from your sales team hoping for that one last feature they need to close their next big deal. Still, other times these demands might come from your general user base simply asking for more features in your product. But with all of these new ideas, how are you to decide which is the best investment for your product?\nLuckily, there’s a simple way to evaluate the impact of adding new potential product features to your product by asking three simple questions. These questions will help you understand not only whether a new feature is worth pursuing, but also how that feature might contribute to your product vision.\nAre you intrigued? Excellent, then let’s learn what these questions are.\n1. Who is this feature for?\nThe first and most important question you should ask about every potential feature is which of your users are most likely to benefit from it? Is the beneficiary a persona known to be a regular user of your product? Or, would this feature appeal to a buyer who is known to influence the purchase of your product? Perhaps the beneficiary is neither a current user or buyer but instead maps to a persona you hope your product will appeal to in the future.\nFor example, imagine that your product is a CRM application designed to help busy sales executives track interactions with prospects more effectively. Your next feature allows sales executives to record notes from interactions with clients using only their voice. This feature likely appeals more to day-to-day users of your product rather than salesforce managers or IT administrators influencing product purchases. On the other hand, if your next feature provides oversight into a salesperson’s daily activities to help managers understand how proactively they are engaging with their prospects, it’s likely to appeal more to salesforce managers who approve the purchase of your product than day-to-day users.\nIn any case, if you can’t articulate exactly which of your personas will benefit from a potential new feature, or if that persona is known not to be a beneficiary of your product, then you should be wary of investing time into bringing that feature to market.\n2. What capability will this feature enable?\nThe next question you should ask about each potential feature is what capability it will actually provide. For example, will this feature support a previously-defined initiative that your product is already pursuing, or does this feature clearly map to the desired capability already on your roadmap?\nWhile there’s always room for a bit of unexpected inspiration, you should carefully consider any potential product features that don’t directly move your product closer to its stated direction.\nGenerally speaking, users tend to show more affinity to products with a tightly cohesive feature set compared to products with a large set of unrelated features. Products with cohesive feature sets tend to be better able to solve your users’ specific problems in obvious ways. That’s why you should favor features that are more likely to contribute to the direction that you’ve already chosen for your product.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\n3. Why are you building this feature?\nThe last question to ask is, why you are building this feature in the first place? Specifically, what benefits does your organization stand to gain from bringing this feature to market?\nWill bringing this feature to market give your product a competitive edge, potentially opening up new market share? Or will this feature add value to an already strong product offering or generate incremental revenue opportunities? Are the benefits of this feature even more subtle, such as increasing your organization’s operational efficiency or increasing the value of your organization’s brand in the market?\nRegardless of what benefit a feature stands to bring, if you can’t articulate exactly how your organization stands to benefit from investing in that feature, then you should be wary of doing so in the first place.\nDownload the Essential Feature Kickoff Book ➜\nStarting with who\nOdds are, you’ve probably already seen variations of these questions in your career as a product manager. In fact, you may have even asked these same questions about some of your own features, in the past. The difference, however, is that most teams who follow this approach start with what.\nStarting with what often results in product managers first identifying a feature, and then working backward in an attempt to justify how it might contribute to the product vision. This often results in products bloated with features of dubious value. Or, products lacking a coherent vision or purpose.\nBut by starting with who, you take time first to understand not only who your target users are, but also what problems they are facing. As a result, you’re more likely to create features that will add value to your users’ lives and deeply resonate with the problems they face on a daily basis.\nHowever, there’s also another, less obvious advantage. By first focusing your efforts on developing a deep understanding of who your users are and the problems that they face, you increase the likelihood that you’ll also identify additional opportunities to solve similar problems for those same users in the future. Not only does this better position your product to become more entrenched in your users’ daily lives, but it also enables you to grow your product by offering more capabilities to your current user base rather than forcing you to continuously identify new types of users and problems to solve.\nPutting this to work for you\nNow that you understand what questions you should be asking about each potential product feature that you’re considering, how do you put this to work with your product?\nA great place to start is by looking at some of the requests at the top of your product backlog. Ideally, these should be requests that have been made by some of the parties mentioned earlier but that you haven’t yet committed to delivering.\nDownload the free Backlog Refinement: How to Prioritize What Matters Book➜\nFor each request, evaluate it according to the Who/What/Why framework described here. And then, consider what you learn as a result of doing so. For example, does the priority of any of these features change as a result of being viewed through the lens of this framework, or do some features simply not seem as important to your product’s future as they once did?\nWhatever the outcome, it’s likely that the Who/What/Why framework will add a new way of evaluating which features will genuinely add the most value to your product, and thus the best return on investment for your organization.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/3-questions-to-ask-about-product-feature/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925771690,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"3 Reasons You Should Hire a Senior Product Manager","text":"\n \nOnce you’re blessed with the opportunity to expand your product management team with a new hire, you have options to consider. You can hire a senior product manager who will bring their years of real-world experience and savviness to the table, or you can bring on new talent you can mold and mentor yourself.\nOf course, there’s a little more to this decision. When hiring a senior product manager, their compensation is greater. They are more difficult to find, recruit, and win over. Also, they may have firmly-entrenched ideas about how things should work.\nMeanwhile, a junior product manager will be a more affordable investment. You might even be able to get two for the same price as one senior PM. But they’ll likely require handholding and closer supervision. They won’t start off with much credibility and could turn out to be the wrong fit for the job.\nIn our 2020 Product Management Report, we found that 23.5% of respondents planned to hire a junior product manager this year. Compared with 48.2% expecting to add a “regular” product manager. Directors of Product and Chief Product Officers were less likely to be hired (at 9.8% and 4.8%, respectively).\nIn our 2021 State of Product Management report, hiring was one of the primary focuses of product leader’s budgets.\nSo why should product team leaders favor experience versus potential?\n3 Reasons to Hire a Senior Product Manager\n1. You get what you pay for.\nWhen you hire a senior product manager, the cost is greater, and there’s no getting around that truth. Someone with years of experience knows their worth and commands a higher salary.\nA senior product manager can hit the ground running. They won’t be new at being a product manager. They’ll still need to make the rounds getting to know key stakeholders, sit in on some customer interactions, and bone up on the product and its market. They’ve already learned the basics of the job and gone through all the invaluable steps required to take on this role at a new company before.\nBesides possessing a fundamental grasp of what the role entails, a senior addition to the team brings their specific experiences and expertise. They can begin making keen observations and suggestions predicated on what they’ve dealt with elsewhere.\nMost importantly, product leaders should start handing off real responsibilities to a new senior hire quickly and with confidence. Their learned experience will shorten the time between their first day on the job and their first days of actually adding value. Getting things off your plate is one of the main perks of expanding your team, so the sooner you can confidently make that happen, the better.\n2. Great time investment.\nMentoring, coaching, and showing newbies the ropes can be incredibly rewarding. For some managers, it’s their favorite part of the job.\nBut it’s also incredibly time-consuming. Instead of delegating and focusing on something else, you’ve got to keep a close eye on junior staff as they get their sea legs. It’s important to avoid any costly missteps or indirect damage to your own reputation.\nWhile building up a bullpen of talent may be a strategic goal for your organization, it’s not expected to come at the expense of delivering fantastic user experiences and increasing revenue and profitability. If you’re spending too much time grooming and nurturing, that means your product’s evolution and growth could suffer.\n3. Strong performers elevate teams.\nSome product leaders worry that bringing on a talented, experienced product professional could come back to haunt them, primarily by outshining their own performance.\nBringing on strong performers and positioning them for success is part of being a leader. The benefits these senior staff members bring should raise the profile of the entire product team. There is evidence that the best leaders hire people who are smarter or better than them. Why wouldn’t you want the best players possible on your team?\nExceptions To The Rule\nAre there fresh-faced product professionals that can run circles around established PMs despite their lack of experience? Sure! It’s possible you could luck into an overachieving product savant. One that outperforms their salary and brings incredible value to the organization.\nBut there’s no way to know that before they’re on board until they are in the thick of things. Even then, they’ll need some basic training and additional coaching as they come up to speed.\nBetting on a promising undiscovered talent can pay massive dividends if they pan out. However, when you only have a small number of hires to make during your tenure, do you want to risk it? This isn’t to say that you should never hire an associate product manager with minimal experience. It’s a longshot; you’ll see the same returns as you would from someone with a proven track record.\nAddressing Specific Needs\nAdditional headcount is usually intended to serve a specific purpose as few companies add personnel for the heck of it. That’s why it’s important to remember you’re not building an abstractly ideal organization. Instead, you’re actively filling a role that’s desperately needed. The specifics of that need should be the primary driver for the job description and whom you select to bring aboard.\nBefore you stock up on junior product managers to build your mini-empire and celebrate your new staffing budget, take a step back, and consider what will actually be helpful for you and the product organization:\n Business Analyst\nNeed help with reporting and sorting through reams of data to make informed product decisions? A business analyst could fit the bill, or you could build out a separate analytics team.\nProduct Owner\nDoes the development team need so much attention that there’s no time to think about strategy? Maybe a product owner would be the right fit. They would free staff members to focus on their roles while the product manager deals with the day-to-day issues during implementation.\nGroup Product Manager\nAre there too many products with their own separate schedules, priorities, and customers to supervise? A group product manager can take some of that load and provide the mentoring and attention to detail required. This would help create a consistent approach to product management processes and a single point-person for senior leadership.\nSenior Product Manager\nLaunching a new product and want to give it the attention it deserves and requires? Hire a senior product manager. Put them on the project and remain confident they won’t have to learn on the job for this important new initiative.\nProduct Onboarding Manager\nAre you struggling with your product’s successful adoption (s) and need to shrink the time to value? A product onboarding manager can take on a holistic approach to improving this critical stage in the customer journey. They do this by improving the KPIs the executive team is counting on.\nProduct Operations Manager\nMaybe the day-to-day processes and operations are becoming overwhelming in their own right. Do you want someone to own those and take the reigns for those issues?

ProductPlan’s State of Product Management Report revealed that 72% of product managers are mostly happy or extremely happy in their current role. It’s a dynamic role with a lot of room to grow, so it is no surprise that we see an influx of product managers looking for advice to stand out. If you take away only one idea from this post about improving your product manager resume, I hope you’ll remember this: Highlight the impact of your work, not just the work itself.\nIn my years as a product leader, I’ve reviewed a lot of product managers’ resumes. If I had to point to the most common shortcoming in these documents, it’s that their authors told me only what they did. They didn’t tell me why (or if) it mattered.\nWhy is that so important? I’ll explain below. Then I’ll offer a couple more ideas to give your resume a better chance of standing out from the pile on product leaders’ desks.\nDownload the 2021 Product Management Report ➜\n3 Tips to Make Your Product Manager Resume Stand Out\n1. Show us why your work mattered.\nWhy this works: It shows not only that you’ve done things (which doesn’t mean much) but that you’ve made a difference (which means everything).\nProduct management isn’t about crossing items off of to-do lists. Nor is it about filling your day with tasks, meetings, and commitments. You’ll succeed as a product manager only to the extent that your work makes a positive impact on your company and your customers’ lives.\nLet’s say I’m reviewing a product manager’s resume, and I see bullet after bullet like the following.\nEstablished KPIs for the product team\nCoordinated with several departments across the organization\nResponsible for maintaining the strategic product roadmap\nHeld regular meetings to update executives and other stakeholders\nConducted customer surveys to gather product feedback\nI have no way of knowing whether or not this candidate is an effective product manager. I have no reason to feel confident that this person even knows what product management success looks like. It’s definitely not showing up in those bullets.\nA related point: When I suggest that you highlight your work’s impact, I don’t mean only in terms of revenue or other inward-looking metrics. Product leaders—or at least this product leader—will want to see evidence that you empathize with your customers. That’s the key to success in product management. It’s also lacking in nearly all of the resumes I’ve ever read from product managers.\nHere’s how I’ll be evaluating those bullets in product managers’ resumes and why.\nNot good:\n“I created product ABC.”\nThis tells me nothing about the impact product ABC had—or didn’t have—on anyone.\nBetter:\n“I created product ABC, which earned $X in revenue.”\nWith this statement, I at least get a sense that the product resonated with some users. But I’d be disappointed if the product manager didn’t also think to describe—even briefly—how the product positively affected those users.\nBest:\n“I created product ABC, which helped improve the daily workflows—and therefore, in a small way, the lives—of more than 10,000 users.”\nNow we’re talking!\nThat statement accomplishes so much. It highlights the product’s impact. It demonstrates the product manager’s empathy with their user persona. And it shows humility by acknowledging the product helped to improve lives “in a small way.”\nA resume built around these principles is going to get attention.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\n2. Show us how you bounced back from a mistake.\nWhy this works: It demonstrates you’re able to learn, adapt, and solve problems.\nWhile interviewing product managers over the years, I remember several times uncovering a candidate’s most impressive attributes only after some prodding. Sometimes it happened entirely by accident. The details didn’t appear on their resumes. In fact, the candidates often seemed reluctant to share them with me at all. I think I know why.\nOne of the most valuable skills in product management is the ability to course-correct after the original course proves unsuccessful. But to show a hiring manager that you’ve proven capable of finding a new solution after a failure, you have to acknowledge that past failure.\nHow many times have you included on your resume a story about a disappointment or mistake in a previous job—and how you adapted to overcome it? I’m guessing none, and I don’t blame you. We’ve all been conditioned to believe our resumes should show only success after success.\nBack to those interviews I mentioned above, where I had to pull this information out of a reluctant candidate. Let me describe how it would happen because it usually happened the same way. I’d have the candidate’s resume in front of me, and I’d ask them to elaborate on something they’d written, such as: Implemented several best practices at the company.\n“Give me an example,” I’d say.\nI could tell they wished I hadn’t asked.\n“Oh, well, I introduced a few new processes to the product team when I started with the company. But honestly, they didn’t work out well. So, I tried a different approach. And those processes were really successful. In fact, we ended up sharing them with other departments in the company. They became best practices.”\nTalk about burying the lead!\nThis is the type of story product leaders want to hear from product management candidates. We know you’re not perfect. Nobody is. But we want to know how you’ll react when you make a mistake or suffer a setback.\nBesides, the information in that story illustrates so much more than a “mistake,” if that’s even the right term. It shows growth, a problem-solving mentality, the ability to admit a mistake, and the ability to change direction when necessary.\nAlso, product managers should be effective storytellers. Everyone loves a great comeback story. Including a “How I bounced back after a setback” anecdote will definitely give your resume a competitive edge over the rest.\nWatch our webinar, Hiring and Growing a Successful Product Team, to see what product leaders look for when hiring new team members:\n3. Show us who you inspired… not what you ran.\nWhy this works: Product leaders want to see your ability to persuade, build chemistry, and help a team succeed.\nProduct managers don’t actually “run” anything. All of the teams you’ll work with as a product manager—in development, design, marketing, etc.—report to other people, not you. As we’ve written here at the ProductPlan blog, two of the biggest lies product managers tell themselves are: “I am the CEO of my product” and “All product decisions need to go through me.”\nRunning a team isn’t your job as a product manager. Your job is to persuade, inspire, and lead a team by earning its trust.\nProduct leaders know all of this, of course. So, when you describe your previous product management role as “running” a cross-functional team or major product initiative, you’re not revealing anything unique or interesting to the hiring manager reading your resume.\nThe real question is: Can you bring together several groups of specialists from across your company, make them feel like a team, get them working toward a shared goal, and give them the support they need to do their best work?\nThat’s what a product leader wants to learn about you while perusing your resume. We want to know about your ability to:\nBuild team chemistry\nInspire your colleagues\nCollaborate and get along with all sorts of personality types\nKeep a large group of professionals, many in different departments and even different geographic locations, all pulling in the same strategic direction.\nIf you can demonstrate those abilities in your Product Manager resume—heck, if your resume even demonstrates that you know the value of those abilities—you’re going to stand out among product management candidates.\nAnd if your resume reflects the principles I’ve outlined above, please send it my way.\nRead the Career Guide for Product Managers ➜\nRead more of my conversation on this topic here:\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-manager-resume/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925740581,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"4 Key Responsibilities of Outstanding Product Managers","text":"\n The Definition of the Key Responsibilities of Product Managers\nIn most cases, your core role as a product manager will be two-fold:\nFirst, to set the long-term vision and strategy for your company’s products.\nTo communicate this strategy to all of the relevant participants and stakeholders.\nTypically, the primary tool you will use to accomplish your key roles will be a product roadmap, a strategic, high-level visual document conveying the “why” behind the products you’re building.\nThe product manager’s job description is often not well defined for such a vital and pivotal position within many companies. In addition, product manager responsibilities often vary from company to company, and at first glance, it seems like no two product manager jobs are identical. Case in point: The three statements below come from three very different (and accurate) product manager job descriptions and the key responsibilities of product managers.\nExample Job Descriptions of the Key Product Manager Responsibilities:\nManage from concept to design, sample production, testing, forecast, cost, mass production, promotion, support, and finally, product end of life.\nDelivers the operating plan: the achievement of growth objectives, including market share, revenue, profit, and return on investment for all the channels/categories of business and key customers.\nResponsible for managing and implementing marketing activities through research, strategic planning, and implementation.\nThat’s quite a variety of skills. Whether we look at three or ten job descriptions, you can see that each product management role is varied and unique. I’ve seen the role and influence each product manager has depending on many dynamics—the company’s size, the type of company, the type of product, and the stage of the product. We recently reported the key skills for the role, metrics, and challenges between large and small companies differ significantly.\nSo, what are the key responsibilities of a product manager? What do they all have in common? Moreover, how can you use the role most effectively to usher successful products into the world?\n4 Key Responsibilities of Outstanding Product Managers\nAs a product manager, it is essential to understand that you are a central hub within your company for a lot of critical information about your products, market, competitors, customers, prospects, fundamental industry analysts, and many other constituencies.\nTo succeed, you will need to continually gather and analyze data and business intelligence from all of these sources (as well as your internal sources like sales and customer service). Then, use this data to inform the creation of your roadmap strategy.\nYou will interact with a broad range of departments to ensure your products’ success. You will also translate the input and data you gather to build a case for many decisions you present in your roadmap. As such, there are several vital skills you’ll need to bring to your role as a product manager.\n1. Be transparent about your prioritization and roadmap process.\nRemember, much of your role as a product manager will be explaining “why” to various stakeholders and constituents. Why you’re prioritizing one feature or theme over another in a release; why you’ve chosen to focus more on one particular goal for the next two quarters versus another goal.\nThe best way to get the relevant constituencies — sales, marketing, engineering, your executives — on board with your strategic thinking is to be clear and open with them about why and how you are making decisions.\n2. Be able to say “no,” but explain why in terms that stakeholders understand.\nThere will be plenty of times when an executive will ask for a new feature his gut tells him will be great… when an engineer will suggest tabling the development of a feature set to save time on the next sprint… and when a sales rep will ask (even beg) you to add a specific tool to the next release because a prospect has promised to buy if it’s included.\nBut if those requests will undermine your strategic objectives for the product, you will often have to say no. The key will be in your ability to articulate why (that all-important word in a successful product manager’s vocabulary) you cannot accommodate the request. Again, the more strategic and backed by evidence you can make your roadmap, your constituents’ more likely to understand when you need to say no.\n3. Be a ruthless prioritizer while balancing the needs of customers and stakeholders.\nRegardless of your company’s size or budget, you will always face limited resources for your product development. That means you will always need to prioritize and continually weigh the competing factors of your products, your company’s limited resources, and demands from various stakeholders.\nIf you’re unsure how to set priorities or weigh various factors in developing your roadmap, several great models can help you get started — such as weighted scoring and the Kano model. Some of our team explained more about how the model works in the video below.\nFor a detailed explanation of these and other proven models, you can use to prioritize your roadmap in an environment of limited resources, download ProductPlan’s free book: Product Roadmaps: Your Guide to Planning and Selling Your Strategy.\n4. Bring evidence-based decision-making to your communication.\nAs I’ve stated previously, one key trait of successful product managers is their ability to answer “why” to the many questions they must field from stakeholders throughout their organizations. One of the most effective ways to answer why is with evidence. It’s much more compelling than your opinion — or anyone else’s.\nIf you have real-world user data, customer feedback, and metrics on your product, then you already have an excellent source of business intelligence to inform how best to build your product roadmap. So let your analytics help guide your decisions.\nIf you don’t have real-world user data on your products yet, don’t worry. There are plenty of other ways to gather useful intelligence about your product, customers, and market. Ask your customers directly. Study your competitors’ products. Read online communities or comments on your company’s blog where your prospects or customers discuss your products or your competitors’ products—study research reports from the analysts who cover your industry.\nWhen an executive or sales rep asks why you’ve selected one direction over another for the next iteration of your product, your ability to present a compelling explanation backed by real data will go a long way toward earning their buy-in.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nBecause you play a central role in your organization — always gathering valuable intelligence from various stakeholders, customers, and your market — you are in a unique position to define the success of your product. Your role as the product’s strategist and evangelist will be central to your success and the success of your products.\nReady to put these skills into practice?

Carlos González de Villaumbrosia is the Founder of Product School, originally based in San Francisco. Product School was founded in 2014 and now maintains 20 campuses around the world where they offer certifications in Product Management. They organize events discussing innovations in the software and technology space.\nIt can be easy, especially within large businesses, to take someone’s skills for granted. From the outside, a Product Manager (PM) is a resolute individual responsible for completing a product’s development. This involves (among other things) careful data collection, design awareness, and business knowledge. But today we’re going to talk about one of the most important traits a product manager needs. Product management leadership requires an ability to support their teams to victory! This comes from a combination of collective management and individual relationships; every PM must be equally good at both.\nYou might be able to electrify audiences at the launch of your latest feature, but then find yourself struggling to strengthen relationships within your teams. This is a problem because stakeholder management work is very much bottom-up: it doesn’t come from your claim to authority but from a slow build-up of respect with each team and team members across the company.\nOne very good moment to establish or improve professional relationships with specific team members is on product team one-on-ones.\nRead the Career Guide for Product Managers ➜\nWhat are the 4 Phases of a Successful Product Team One-on-One?\nPhase 1: Look for the signs that your team communication isn’t working.\nSilence in the room: Did you just propose a pretty radical change of direction and nobody said a word? That’s a sign your team needs better communication. A healthy team should at least wonder why you are doing it.\nLack of dissent: If you’re being knowingly tough on a particular project and nobody questions you, then you cannot learn or collaborate.\nUnexpected pitfalls: Milestones are not reached, there are undetected bugs, and there’s an impossible deadline. A normal office should feel free to communicate these pitfalls in advance.\nPutting out fires: Rather than acting, you spend a lot of your time reacting. Again, this is a sign of poor team planning.\nConflicting communication: You speak to your team, and everything’s good and normal. You speak with other teams or even superiors, and everything’s falling into pieces. This sort of mismatch calls for one-on-ones.\nOpen challenges: It’s one thing is to get constructive feedback. It’s something different to be contradicted in front of everyone. That’s a sign that something has gone wrong in your communication.\nIndividual isolation: If one member of the team seems removed from collective activities, operations cannot really function.\nEvery situation will be different. It’s not the same to work at a small startup compared to a big enterprise. It’s not the same to seek a discussion with a colleague you have known for a long time compared to a new hire. And it’s definitely not the same to hold a product team one-on-one during a normal check-in compared to a huge failure. Keep these different parameters in mind and apply some common sense.\nTo have the most successful product team one-on-one in all of these contexts, we recommend the following.\nPhase 2: Prepare for your product team one-on-one.\nGather information and data that back-up your claims.\nSituation, action, result. What’s the situation that you wish to correct? What‘s the action that this person can do to help you out? What’s the intended goal?\nBe tactful. A private meeting with your Product Manager might sound intimidating. According to a study performed by Google, one aspect of their most successful teams is psychological safety. “The safer team members feel with one another, the more likely they are to admit mistakes, to partner, and to take on new roles.”\nOpen the communication stream both ways. Make it clear to your team that they can also use this time to voice their own concerns and ask their own questions. This is as much for them as it is for you.\nPhase 3: Run effective product team One-On-Ones.\nState the topic from the start.\nHave an action point at the end of the meeting.\nBegin with a positive discussion. Then, bring up “negatives” in a constructive way.\nListen, don’t anticipate. Clear your mind of what you’re expecting to hear, and really hear them.\nPhase 4: Close the loop after your One-On-One.\nCreate a shared document that you both have access to and can edit.\nWrite down the key takeaways and actionable steps from the product team one-on-one immediately and share them with your colleague to make sure you’re on the same page.\nBe patient. Many times, Product Managers lack the authority to act straight away. On the other hand, if this is something that you expect to become routine; share!\nPut your insights together and find a common narrative that you can explain to the team.\nTransform this qualitative information into actionable metrics. Set relevant targets from the meeting. Are you trying to decide on the need for future hires? Did a team member request further training to be funded by the company?\nHow to Know Your One-on-Ones are Working:\nTeamwork and organizational trust are critical to operations, but as they are abstract concepts they can be difficult to measure. Paul J. Zak, the author of Trust Factor, came up with some simple metrics you can use to measure communication:\nEnergy: How much communication is happening. Are your Slack channels silent? Is the lunchroom full of people staring at their phones?\nEngagement: What reaction do you get when you say something to your teams? If your messages are met with apathy and disinterest you may have a problem.\nExploration: Does your team talk to anyone outside of the project, in the company, or in the industry?\nNow go forth and run your own one-on-ones with your product team.

There are two approaches to prioritizing product features:\nYou prioritize the features and initiatives that you, your team, or your stakeholders think would be a good idea—and hope that it works out.\nYou start by figuring out which features have the highest engagement and which ones don’t get used. Then you identify which steps in your workflow cause the biggest drop-offs—where users are getting stuck. And finally, seek to understand your users’ needs, their sources of hesitation, and the conversations going on in their minds.\nThis should be a no-brainer. You have a much better chance of making things people want if you understand what the market needs are, and if you focus on fixing the areas where your product has the biggest leaks.\nDownload Prioritize Your Roadmap  ➜\nPrioritization struggles of teams\nBut many product teams still operate using the first approach—they make decisions based on their own opinions, rather than data-informed, educated hypotheses. ProductPlan’s co-founder Jim Semick talks to a lot of product leaders in his line of work. And in one of his recent webinars, he mentions that even large, well-known companies struggle with:\nDecisions not being tied to strategic goals\nStakeholders questioning prioritization\nPriorities being driven by the loudest executives or the latest sales prospects\nClearly these organizations are doing something well, otherwise, they wouldn’t be well-known. But the wasted opportunity is huge. Companies that build products based on internal opinions will eventually get beaten by the competition.\nSo how do you make sure you’re newly prioritized product roadmap includes features and initiatives that will really move the needle?\nWhat you need is a process for generating ideas, prioritizing which ones to focus on, and getting buy-in from key stakeholders. In the following sections, I’m going to break down a step-by-step framework—originally pioneered by conversion optimization expert Peep Laja—to help you do just that.\nStep 1: Gather Actionable Data\nLike we talked about earlier, rather than creating a prioritized product roadmap based solely on our opinion, we’re going to use a data-informed approach.\nSo how do we go about gathering data?\nThere are 5 steps (followed by creating a master list of all the issues you found that we will then turn into potential product features, fixes, and action items):\nProduct analytics — Identify specific steps in your product workflow where users are getting stuck and leaving instead of taking the action you want them to take.\nMouse tracking analysis — This lets you record what people do with their mouse, and this can give you insights into where users are paying attention to your product.\nOn-page surveys — If you want to find out what’s stopping people from performing a specific action, put Qualaroo on your page and ask them.\nSupport transcripts — Dig into your customer support transcripts to find out why people are reaching out and asking for help. They usually reach out with frustrations and confusion, and that can give you insight into things you can fix.\nUser testing — Observe current users and potential users as they interact with your product while they speak their thought process out loud. User session is also great because they anonymously record videos of your users as they use your product, allowing you to see everything they do.\nAs you analyze the results of your research, make a list of all the places where users get stuck or frustrated, where people aren’t doing what you want them to do, and where you see things that need to be improved. If you want a more detailed explanation of how to execute each of these research methods, go check out this article.\nStep 2: Identify the Highest Value Initiatives\nOkay, so you’ve generated all of this quantitative and qualitative data… what now?\nWell, at this point you’ll have identified a big list of product issues and feature ideas. The next step is to figure out which initiatives are worth working on, and weeding out the ones that aren’t.\nFirst, start by thinking through each of these potential opportunities and plotting them on the matrix below.\nThe y-axis represents the value that each initiative delivers to either the company (e.g. gets you more sign-ups) or the customer (e.g. saves them time). And the x-axis represents how much effort, time, money, and other resources each initiative will take to implement (e.g. development hours).\nFor example, let’s say ‘Item B’ is a redesign of one of your current features. It’s not going to take much effort, and it’s going to deliver high business value.\nOnce you’ve plotted all the initiatives you identified in your initial research, the next step is to prioritize the highest value items and figure out which ones to say “no” to. To help you make this decision, start by overlaying this grid on your matrix:\nAs you can see, the initiatives in the upper-left side of this graph provide high business value and require low effort—this is the low-hanging fruit that you want to start with. The items that fall into the upper-right quadrant will also deliver a lot of value, but they’re more complex and require more effort to implement. These are important but should get done after the items from the first quadrant.\nSome of the ideas in the lower-left section may be able to deliver some quick wins, but since they provide low business value you need to seriously question whether they’re worth prioritizing. And finally, you definitely shouldn’t consider any of the ideas that are high-effort & low-value.\nStep 3: Score Your Initiatives\nNow that you’ve weeded out all the potential opportunities that don’t provide strategic value, the next step is to score your remaining initiatives.\nThink through the benefits that your organization will receive and costs it will require to implement, and then rank each factor on a scale of 1 – 5 (1 being low benefit/cost and 5 being high benefit/cost).\nYou can either use tools like ProductPlan for your scoring model, or you can create your own process using a spreadsheet.\nAnd of course, this scoring model isn’t the only factor that goes into deciding which features to prioritize—you also need to take your competition, market, and customers into consideration. But this analysis can be critical for getting stakeholder buy-in.\nStep 4: Get Stakeholder Buy-In on Your Newly Prioritized Product Roadmap\nCreating alignment with your product strategy and getting buy-in from executives and managers can be tricky. But you can make it less of a challenge by proactively addressing a few of their key concerns.\nOur first recommendation is that you walk your stakeholders through the process you used to create your prioritized product roadmap. Demonstrating that you used a structured thought process to evaluate opportunities—rather than just going by your gut or your opinion—is an effective way to get stakeholders on board.\nSecond, bring customer evidence to the table. This is where the data you gathered in step 1 comes into play. You’ve gathered real evidence about your product from both existing and potential customers, and this sort of data is more compelling to executives and managers than your opinion. So back up your decision with hard data. Use the metrics you gathered from your analytics tool to show them what users are doing. And then use video clips of users interacting with your product, and direct quotes from your customers to explain why.\nAnd finally, always tie your priorities back to the organization’s strategic business goals. Doing this right off the bat will help answer the question in everyone’s mind of “Why are you doing this instead of something else?”\nRather than just talking about what a new feature will do, tell them how it’s going to impact the bottom line and move the needle on the KPIs that your stakeholders care about most. For example, the data shows that we’re killing it when it comes to user acquisition, but we struggle to get those users to come back over the long-term. So we’re implementing this initiative in order to improve our retention rate.\nTakeaways\nWhether you’re using a scoring model or some other kind of model to evaluate and prioritize opportunities, the technique you’re using is ultimately less important than the conversation that you’re having with your stakeholders.\nRegardless of the tools and techniques you use, it’s important that you’re transparent with your stakeholders, and that you give them some insight into the process you used to create your prioritized product roadmap.\nBy addressing their concerns and objections proactively, you make it much less likely that you’ll get pushback. And the best way to do that is to show them that you used a systematic process, you based your decisions on hard data (not your opinion), and that your priorities are aligned with the strategic goals of the organization.\nWhat do you think? What process do you use to make sure you’re prioritizing the right initiatives and building things people want?

We spend lots of time thinking about the best way to deliver our product roadmaps, give presentations, run effective meetings, and create stakeholder alignment. But in reality, the communication tool we use far more often is email.\nEven if internal communication has shifted to collaboration platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, email is still the universal communication method for interacting with customers. And there may be no more valuable type of email than a customer interview email that solicits customer feedback.\nProduct managers can’t effectively do their jobs without understanding customer needs and gauging their satisfaction with the current offering. And while in a perfect world we’d get to sit down and chat with every user about their experience, that’s not a particularly scalable model.\nBut by reaching out to customers via email during specific moments in the customer journey, product managers can tap into what users feel while the experience is still fresh in their minds.\nThese emails are important because customer feedback is the lifeblood of any customer-centric organization, revealing exciting opportunities and painful realizations. But if the emails you’re sending don’t spark a response, you’ll never know what you’re missing.\nRead the Customer Interview Tool Box ➜\n4 Key Ingredients of an Effective Customer Feedback Request Email\nYour customers didn’t ask you to ask for their feedback, so you must make it worth their while. By including each of the following in your email template, you’ll increase your response rate and the quality of what you hear back.\n1. Lead with intention\nBeing clear and concise is the key here. Tell them why you’re reaching out—you just tried a feature, haven’t used the product in a while, etc. That way, they don’t think it is just a blanket spam email sent to every user.\n2. Tell them what you want\nAn open-ended request for feedback might seem the least intrusive and limiting, but that can seem daunting to a user not in the habit of offering input and might swamp you with all kinds of irrelevant comments. Be specific without being too leading in your request (think “we want to hear about your experience” and not “tell us what we should do better”).\n3. Ask for availability while respecting their time\nIf your email asks the customer to participate in a call, web conference, or follow-up meeting, be upfront with exactly how much time you’re asking for. Less is more, in this case, so design your feedback session to be efficient, limiting the focus so you can squeeze it into as narrow a window as possible. Telling them you only need, for example, 15 minutes of their time, should increase response rates and be less of a burden on both of your schedules.\nWatch our webinar on scaling customer-centricity to see how to strike the balance:\n4. Be genuine\nRemember, you are asking them for a favor, and they owe you nothing! Use natural language and don’t come across as too pushy or demanding. The more human and organic it feels, the more likely they’ll want to respond.\n4 Customer Feedback Request Email Templates\nHere are some basic templates for four different types of requests to help you along your journey in crafting useful emails. Use these as starting points, customizing them based on your product’s nature, what you know about the customer and the specific context of “the ask.”\nThese templates are specifically requesting a phone call or meeting. They could just as easily prompt the user to complete a survey or provide feedback directly via an emailed response. Remember, anything you can do to make this seem like a person-to-person interaction and not an automated, system-generated message will improve the odds of a positive response.\n1. The Feature Feedback Request\n“Hello [the customer’s first name],\nI see you tried [X feature] recently. I’m very interested to hear about your experience on [feature-specific topic]. Do you have some time in the next week or so for a short, 30-minute conversation?\nThank you, and I look forward to hearing from you,\n[Your name]\n[Your title at/@ your company]”\n2. The Discovery Session\n“Hello [the customer’s first name],\nThank you for recently purchasing [Y enterprise product]. We’re curious to understand more about your decision process to buy it, and how your experience has been so far— specifically how you’re finding [topic B]. Do you have some time in the next week or so for an informal 15-minute conversation?\nThank you, and I look forward to hearing from you,\n[Your name]\n[Your title at/@ your company]”\n3. The Feature Validation Session\n“Hello [the customer’s first name],\nI see you run [ABC, are using a particular product feature, or are a particular user]. Based on that experience, I would be very interested in getting your feedback on a potential new feature we’re considering. Do you have some time in the next week for a conversation? It would be great to spend 45 minutes to an hour exploring this with you.\nThank you, and I look forward to hearing from you,\n[Your name]\n[Your title at/@ your company]”\n4. The Support Experience Review\n“Hello [the customer’s first name],\nI saw you recently contacted customer support regarding an issue you were having with [topic Z]. I would be very interested in hearing your feedback on your customer support experience, and making sure your issue was entirely resolved. Do you have some time in the next week or for a conversation? It should be a quick 15-minute conversation if you’re open to it.\nThank you, and I look forward to hearing from you,\n[Your name]\n[Your title at/@ your company]”\nPrepare for the Response\nBy relying on templates, automated workflows, and routine, product managers can create a continuous feedback loop by prompting customers for their input. As the goal is for customers to respond and set up a time to talk, be sure your calendar is relatively open before firing these emails off.\nYou don’t want to spoil your first interaction with them by delaying the actual phone call until their experience is no longer fresh. So don’t be too overly aggressive in sending out more requests than you can reasonably handle.\nWhat product managers hear back from these feedback sessions may be startling insights, painful realizations, or helpful, constructive criticism, thanks to asking great questions before sitting back and listening. But without asking, there’s no way to know what’s truly on the mind of real users. The more perspectives we receive, the more informed and grounded our decisions will be.\nTo avoid overreacting to any lone nugget of feedback, product teams need a defined system for capturing, organizing, validating, and summarizing what they hear. You should contextualize and socialize these results to key stakeholders. They can learn from what’s really happening in the marketplace, adjusting their plans and strategy accordingly.\nCustomer Interview Email Takeaways\nOn a final note, don’t forget to close the loop with customers who give their time and provide feedback. Follow up when their requests are being acted on or are now available, as well as when you decide they won’t be in the cards. It’s the least you can do to acknowledge their participation in the process.\nRead the Customer Interview Tool Box\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/customer-interview-email-templates/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925779241,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"5 Hidden Prioritization Pitfalls That Product Managers Should Avoid","text":"\n Product management can often be a difficult balancing act, in which you find yourself constantly trying to satisfy many competing agendas for your product. Your sales team wants a new set of features. Your executives want the product market-ready by a certain date. Development wants to push a few items off until the next release. The investors want to shave costs wherever possible. You want to make sure your product doesn’t fall behind the competition. And your customers want everything.\nAnd because it can be so difficult to know exactly what to prioritize amid all of this noise, product managers can easily fall into several pitfalls — and prioritize the wrong things for their products. Below are common prioritization pitfalls, and ideas for avoiding them.\n5 Product Management Prioritization Pitfalls\n1. Prioritizing based on what your competitors are doing.\nOne of the easiest traps a product manager can fall into when he’s not sure what strategic direction to take his product is to chase the competition. This can be especially tempting when a competitive product has functionality the PM’s product doesn’t.\nThe problem, though, is that when you base your product’s development on what your competitors are doing, the best-case scenario will be that you release a me-too product. And the more likely scenario, which will be even worse, is that you remain behind the competition. After all, if their product already has the functionality that you’re prioritizing for your development, your competitors have likely moved on to building new functionality. This means your product will always be behind.\nTweet This:\n“When you prioritize based on your competitors, the best-case scenario is that you will build a me-too product.”\nYou can’t ignore your competitors entirely, of course. But your product’s development should be based on the research, your customer feedback and innovative ideas that you and your team compile — not on what another product is doing.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Strategy Workbook➜\n2. Prioritizing based on requests from your sales team.\nThis is another common trap product managers fall into, for several understandable reasons.\nFirst, their sales reps are on the front lines with customers, many product managers reason, and if they’re convinced that a feature set or defect fix should be prioritized over everything else, they must be right.\nProduct managers also often defer to their sales team for direction on what to prioritize because it’s easy. Sales will always have an opinion, after all, and deferring to that opinion requires less effort than stepping back and looking strategically at your market, gathering and analyzing feedback from your user base, etc.\nThis is why product managers should spend more time reviewing their product roadmaps, and why those roadmaps should provide a high-level strategic view of the product’s objectives and the reasoning behind them.\nA product manager who doesn’t frequently review her product roadmap can easily lose all sense of direction for the product’s strategic purpose. This makes it a lot more likely that the product manager will fall prey to whatever prioritization strategy that Sales — or whoever offers the loudest or most passionate demands — wants to advance.\nSpeaking of which…\n3. Prioritizing whatever requests are loudest, most passionate or even most recent.\nLet’s say a product manager doesn’t have (or fails to regularly review) a high-level strategic roadmap for her product. By the time she is weeks or months into the day-to-day development details of the product, it will be easy for this product manager to lose a sense of the product’s ultimate strategic purpose.\nAnd because she will likely be juggling many competing demands for prioritizing the limited development time and resources she has, this product manager can fall into the trap of placing undue weight and importance on whoever’s request is most passionate, or even the most recent request she’s received.\nThis bias is built into human nature. You’ve probably had the experience of listening to two people debate and, assuming they were both relatively persuasive, agreeing with the person who spoke last. This phenomenon even plays out in the legal system, which is why judges in court cases often have to warn juries not to be swayed by the attorney who speaks last.\nA product without a strategic direction is essentially being developed in a vacuum. If product managers don’t establish this direction and then protect it throughout the development process, other agendas can and will come in to fill that vacuum.\n4. Prioritizing what’s easy.\nAnother way that a product manager without a strong sense of strategic direction for a product can fill that vacuum is to place undue significance on any items that can be completed easily for the next release.\nThis can give the product manager a sense of pride and accomplishment, but it often leads to a lackluster release that can leave sales and marketing with little to tout.\nFor example, your developers might tell you that they can get a lot of items checked off of the list, make a lot of minor tweaks or fix a lot of issues with the current version of your product. And if you don’t have a strategic vision and plan for the product’s next release, this might sound like a viable strategy.\nTweet This:\n“Completing items on your backlog just because they’re easy is not a product strategy.”\nThe problem is, completing items on your backlog just because they’re easy is not a product strategy. In fact, doing so is a strong indication that you are not working strategically toward an objective for your product or your market. So even if you manage to accomplish every item on that “easy” list for your next release, that release is likely to fall flat.\n5. Prioritizing based on your gut instinct alone.\nFinally, some product managers mistakenly prioritize their gut instinct over everything else — including market feedback other real-world data.\nStrategically driving a product to a successful market launch certainly requires a skilled product manager’s instincts. But it also equally demands hard evidence and a framework to support the product manager’s decisions.\nThis evidence might come in the form of industry research, user surveys, conversations with customers, feedback from the company’s sales or support teams, a combination of these metrics, or other quantifiable data points. The key here is to understand that a product’s strategic direction has to be backed to some degree by data, not merely by a product manager’s hunch.\nOne powerful strategy in your development process is to set out with a metric that you want to improve with your next release or next several releases. That metric will help you determine whether or not the releases are a success. You might decide at the beginning of your development cycle, for example, that you want to increase the average number of sales, or to help your sales team sell to more small businesses.\nWhen you have this primary metric in place, it will help guide your strategic thinking and planning and will help keep you proactive and focused on what matters as all of the day-to-day requests and issues come up during the development process. In other words, having a data-driven strategic goal can help you avoid a lot of the prioritization pitfalls we’ve been discussing up to this point.\nThis is another reason to build and refer often to a visual product roadmap. With the right roadmap application, you’ll be able to generate an at-a-glance strategic view of your product’s goals and the metrics you’ll be using to track those objectives. This will help keep you on track strategically throughout the process — and will help you tune out the noise coming at you with competing agendas.\nDownload the product manager's guide to prioritization  ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/5-prioritization-pitfalls/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925742487,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"5 Things That Can Ruin Your Roadmap","text":"\n Most product managers know the product roadmap can be your best friend, or your worst nightmare. When used in the right way, the roadmap can help explain how you’ll achieve your vision. And when used in the wrong way, the roadmap can sink you with endless PowerPoint updates, meaningless features, and commitments that can never be delivered.\nAt a recent meetup, I sat with a diverse group of product managers, to get to the heart of the roadmap issue. The folks in the room came from corporate and startup and had a range of experience. Most were working locally in Sydney, Australia, but we were also joined by an expat who was on sabbatical from Silicon Valley.\nIn two hours, five key insights emerged around the problems that can make roadmaps ineffective and troublesome.\n1. Your Organization Has Too Many Priorities\nOne participant shared with us that his startup had seven KPIs they were tracking, essentially seven priorities… as you can imagine, this was making his job as product manager incredibly difficult. How can you prioritize development when you’re trying to move the dial on seven things at once?\nIn situations like these, it can be easy to fall into the trap of building a little bit of everything, to somewhat satisfy each of the KPIs. But it’s also easy to fall short on every single one of those priorities and create a Frankenstein product in the process.\nThe hard road is to push back and work with the team to identify a single clear priority, whether that be revenue, user acquisition, learning goals, or something else. This is a potentially confrontational discussion to have, but one that will pay off in terms of being able to get traction on that single goal.\n2. Your Roadmap Isn’t Visually Attractive\nThis one may cause some debate. One of our participants recounted that his CPO claimed he’d never known an ugly roadmap to be successful.\nRoadmaps are communication tools, so if good design results in the roadmap being easy to understand, that’s obviously an essential requirement. But of course aesthetics can go much further than that, and represent real beauty, design and style.\nThere’s a strong argument that aesthetics lend credibility. They give your document the sense of being crafted with care and attention. They suggest to the audience that you’re a professional who can be trusted to deliver on the vision. When the audience has that level of faith in you and the roadmap, it helps drive their future behavior to support those outcomes.\nThe keyword, of course, is audience. It’s common to create different versions of a roadmap for different audiences – a practice often focused on the content of the roadmap, but sometimes design too. Some personalities will value aesthetics, while others won’t. A product manager can deduce the preferences of the audience and consider the context to hit the right note on visual appeal.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\n3. Your Roadmap Was Created in a Vacuum\nStakeholder management is the bread and butter of product management. And I have a theory that the skill of being a universal translator is what lands many people in the product management field. (That means I think you’re pretty good at it already).\nBut sometimes, the need to own the roadmap drives product managers to produce it alone, or without the input of some parts of the wider organization.\nThis mistake is avoided with a balance of ego and humility. Product managers have to be humble enough to recognize the best ideas, even when they aren’t their own. They also have to be strong enough to push back on ideas that have no links to strategic objectives or the target customers.\nBy walking this balance, product managers can own the roadmap, while keeping stakeholders involved in the process. Ultimately this provides the foundation for the organization to deliver on the roadmap together. Alignment like that is a powerful force.\n4. Your Roadmap Lacks Links to The Product Vision\nA roadmap should describe how the product is going to move the product toward the vision. I hear this mantra a lot and our meetup group spent some time discussing this concept.\nIt’s not that product managers disagree with this one, it’s just sometimes hard to bring to life in the roadmap document. Some say we never see good examples from real companies, while others aren’t sure links to strategic goals can be concisely communicated.\nThink of it this way. Your roadmap is not a list of features and functionality and it’s not a project plan. It’s the document that shows how your organization will get from where you are today to the product objective. Tell your product story in a compelling way. This story will include people (your users), the journey the product is going on (the roadmap), and why it’s important (the link to the vision).\nDownload Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\n5. Your Roadmap Changes Every Other Week\nOne of our meetup participants shared that his roadmap was changing on a fairly regular basis. This creates a lot of busy-work to keep the roadmap up-to-date, but more importantly, when the roadmap changes constantly it’s unlikely you’re getting any closer to those strategic goals.\nRoadmaps can change, in fact they should change, in response to learning, shifts in the market, and sometimes competitor activities. But too many changes suggest indecision. They suggest the organization isn’t sure how to achieve its strategic goals.\nIf that’s the case, then it’s time to take action around that indecision. Dig into what’s driving it and set learning goals designed to reduce risks and doubts.\nRuined Roadmaps Saved…\nThere is no magic wand. Like our products, we need to iterate ourselves, constantly observing our successes and failures to improve the roadmaps we present. Many of the senior product professionals I meet say their on the job experience provides the most powerful learning opportunity, but talking with peers about the challenges they face also figures strongly in the way they build their capabilities.\nMeetups – or getting the perspective of another product manager – can provide an alternate view on the roadmap, which just might help reveal you’ve fallen into one of these traps. We’ve all done at least one of these at some point in our careers (Yep, I admit to it!) And we’d probably like to avoid making the same mistake again.\nAbout the Guest Author:\nJen Marshall is CEO at Brainmates, the Australian Product Management Training and Consulting company that organizes the Leading the Product conference in Sydney and Melbourne.

Thinking back, it’s surprising that it was only about five years ago that I had an important epiphany that would alter the trajectory of our company’s product strategy and my career. As the Director of User Experience, our team was tightly partnered with our product management counterparts to ensure we had baked-in practices and habits that enabled all of our development teams to deliver an exceptional product experience effortlessly. And our success was evident in the feedback. Over 20% of customers took the time to praise the product’s ease of use every month in our Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys. Pat on back.\nBut as someone passionate about user feedback, I started noticing a trend in those same NPS responses that kept some customers from being promoters (i.e., 9s or 10s on the scale). There were hints that the onboarding ramp was steep, for example. Or, while most of the customers raved about our support team, others expressed frustration around how long it took to get a response to their support requests. It hit me by surprise but was so incredibly obvious at the same time: The user’s experience does not start and end within the software itself.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nThere are other aspects and touchpoints of their experience outside of our product team’s purview or control. This meant that no matter how awesome our UX practices were within the product development organization, we’d never reach our full potential without being more inclusive of other customer-facing roles. In the above examples, that meant, to make more promoters out of our customers, our experience strategy required building stronger partnerships with our onboarding and support teams.\nThe Product Team’s Role in Customer Experience Strategy\nSo, a simple realization kicked off a new era for both the company and my career, eventually leading to the creation of a new role and slightly different title from Director of User Experience to Director of Customer Experience. But I was still a member of the Product leadership team, and the reason for that is relatively simple – we were a product company and, therefore, a product-lead organization. We were the hub by which the rest of the organizational spokes organized and focused their efforts, so it was natural for the product team to kick off the Customer Experience Conversation. To meet the increasing demands of our customers consistently, we needed to develop stronger partnerships and expand our user experience philosophy and practices cross-functionally.\nWhat is Customer Experience (CX), and Why Does it Matter?\nThere are widely varying definitions of customer experience. So, for this conversation, I am defining Customer Experience (CX) as how your customers perceive their interactions with your company across the span of their end-to-end journey. These perceptions are important because they inevitably trigger emotions, and emotions drive decision-making. It’s not intuitive for businesses to consider emotions as part of their equation, but make no mistake that your customers are human beings at the end of the day. Strong emotions such as anger and frustration or pleasant surprise and happiness are the fundamental drivers of whether customers will choose your product, whether they will engage with your product, and whether they’ll stay loyal to your business.\nTo further press the urgency of a robust CX strategy in your business, in 2019, Qualtric’s XM Institute published a study to better understand the impact of Customer Experience on business. Their research further validates the bottom-line impact that emotions can have on a business. A highly rated experience correlates to a significant increase in the customer’s willingness to spend more money with a company, trust and recommend them, and try out new features and offerings from the company. Overall, a compelling customer experience strategy adds significant value to the business over time through its impact on revenue, growth, and customer loyalty.\nThe problem is organizational silos\nWhile over 80% of businesses report increased investments in improving Customer Experience, they often struggle to deliver truly exceptional results effectively and sustainably. Why? Because the operational models that serve the company well in so many other aspects are the key blockers of CX success. More specifically, the biggest challenge is in the natural tendency of organizations to create separate departments within the business. The division of functional departments inevitably creates organizational silos, a key roadblock to a successful, long-term customer experience strategy.\nDivided operational oversight\nBy nature of having organizational silos, the business intentionally separates and distributes ownership of all the ingredients required for its ongoing success. Departmentalization has enormous benefits from a business perspective; most importantly, the ability to apply much-needed focus and investment across various efforts. But it also creates an inherent “bubble” from within each department will operate when it comes to designing processes and experiences against the bigger picture. Lack of a broader perspective introduces an increased risk of uncoordinated customer touchpoints and duplicate efforts in different pockets of the organization.\nLack of shared goals\nEach department has its own set of metrics and goals that they are responsible for delivering. But what happens when there’s a separate set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from one department to the other? Most businesses recognize the value and necessity of cross-functional efforts but fall short of creating shared goals at the executive level. Competing goals decrease the likelihood that departments will get the investment and resources they need cross-functionally to deliver effectively. So, each department’s goals are not met to their full potential, they’re also more likely to blame the other for not helping them hit the right targets.\nFragmented technology investments\nOne potentially significant and unintended outcome of silos, especially for software companies, is an uncoordinated suite of customer-facing technology platforms. Adding digital touchpoints is a culmination of not sharing oversight or goals across business functions. When one department is unable to obtain internal investment to solve a particular problem or need, they’ll leverage their budget to seek it out externally. For example, marketing probably has a separate website, and Customer Support probably has a platform for help documentation and service requests. However, if you’re in the business of a technology-based product customers will not differentiate these disparate experiences from the product itself. That puts all the hard efforts your product teams put into building great user experiences at risk of falling short in the bigger picture.\n5 Ways for Product Teams to Drive an Exceptional Customer Experience Strategy\nAs I previously mentioned, I’m a firm believer that the product team in a software organization is perhaps the best positioned to help catapult a successful Customer Experience Strategy for their businesses. For starters, product teams are at a strong advantage because their role is already cross-functional. In coordinating their efforts across the organization, the team has critical access to observe the subtle differences in focus and processes that might put their customer’s experience at risk. Additionally, the product team is naturally poised to drive end-to-end experience improvements since user experience is already (or should be) a top priority of their efforts. This unique perspective and experience-driven oversight put the product team on the front line of driving change in various ways.\n1. Become Intimately familiar with the customer journey\nTo be successful, this is more than just familiarity, rather, intentional curiosity. How intimately do you understand your customers’ interactions across each phase of their journey with your business and by the different departments in your company? One surefire way to get on the same page is to conduct a cross-functional Journey Mapping Workshop. Journey mapping forces outside-in (customer-centered) thinking by each department, who instinctively design their processes from an inside out (business-centered) perspective. The activity and resulting visual artifact is a powerful tool to promote internal awareness and alignment and to generate actionable insights on key areas of opportunity for the business to rally cross-functionally behind.\n2. Share and advocate the journey\nUnderstanding the customer’s journey deepens your understanding of user context, it’s critically important to the long-term success of new features and improvements to the product. Share this context diligently with your teams, and paint the picture of the broader perspective as part of your planning and kickoff of new efforts. Sharing context challenges your team to consider aspects of the experience they otherwise may have overlooked and ask essential questions outside of the immediate product purview. For example, what’s the best point along the journey to generate awareness of this new feature to achieve peak adoption? How can the team partner with their CS counterparts to understand the impact the feature may have on current and future support offerings? It can even expose more complicated nuances where upsell and value-added features are involved, like how to craft an experience that doesn’t complicate or create confusion for customers in the way they are billed for your product services.\n3. Broaden cross-functional conversations\nProduct Managers notoriously have busy schedules meeting with other functions across the business; most of these are driven by a need to align other departments to the product strategy, goals, and roadmap. As the leader of these meetings, make time in the agenda to ask stakeholders to also share their initiatives. Ask them what challenges they are facing and how you might help. Get curious—better yet, involved—where appropriate. Of course, this may require some additional time investment on the front-end. The investment is minimal compared to the costs a business can incur in the long term due to the dangerous pitfalls of uncoordinated efforts.\n4. Approach cross-functional relationships as partners, not inputs\nIt’s all too easy for the product team to become the sounding board for all the other departments vying for their resources; after all, your team owns and sets the product strategy. The endless stream of things a product team could do is why it’s vital for them to constantly develop their skill in the art of saying no. Although your team is ultimately responsible for the product vision, there’s no reason that it needs to be a black hole and can’t be more strategically collaborative. Consider up-leveling conversations that involve people in other departments in setting product strategy. Exposing other departments to the myriad of difficult decisions you face every day not only empowers them to bring more relevant ideas to the table but also provides more understanding (and less disappointment) behind your “no”.\n5. Make CX a vital component of your product strategy\nSuccessful execution of a businesses’ customer experience strategy requires investment from each functional department, and product strategy is no exception. Partner across the organization to set shared goals and KPIs around CX, for example NPS, support request volume, time-to-value within the product or for engagement of a particular feature, etc.\nAligned goals and metrics ensure space can be made on the product roadmap to address product-related issues that drive CX challenges, such as usability improvements. It also ensures continuity with 3rd party systems so the product can remain the single digital customer touchpoint.\nTakeaways\nIt’s not your product team’s responsibility to deliver features to your customers, rather to craft an exceptional product experience that drives the loyalty that keeps your customers engaged and makes your product an easy sell for future customers. However, in this day and age, that experience is hardly ever isolated within the product itself but spans in purview across the different organizational silos of your company. Getting genuinely curious – and involved – in the company’s customer experience strategy is the best way to succeed in ultimately delivering a truly exceptional product.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925746384,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"5 Ways ProductPlan Helps Standardize Your Roadmaps","text":"\n Sometimes you don’t know you have a problem until something breaks. Young companies are often scrappy by design. Their product teams are small and agile. Perhaps the team consists of a few product managers. These professionals can easily communicate, stay aligned, and present a cohesive product strategy to the team. Many teams fail to understand the importance of a roadmap. They fail to understand how it can help standardize and align their team.\nThe scrappy methods that worked in the past can lead to inconsistency and disorganization as the company scales. There are more features to build, more roadmaps to maintain, and more stakeholders to satisfy. Without standardized processes to maintain uniformity, tiny inconsistencies in how each product manager approaches their work are magnified over time. This results in miscommunication, redundant work, and errors.\nWhether you’re a product manager or a product operations person for a large enterprise organization, we want to help you. Our roadmap software can help you create streamlined processes that scale along with your company. Our roadmaps can improve efficiency, reduce redundant work, and establish best practices.  Here are five ways ProductPlan helps you and your product team standardize roadmaps.\nCreate a Roadmapping Process that Grows as You Grow\nAdopting roadmapping software alone goes a long way toward establishing the organization-wide processes that allow your team to scale. Without a tool built for roadmapping specifically, many product managers rely on square-peg, round-hole solutions. For example, spreadsheets and slide decks, neither of which make it easy to maintain uniformity.\nProduct roadmaps should be consistent in the way they present information. They can be pretty complex, packing tons of data into a visual format that spans months. Moreover, roadmaps illustrate various work across teams. To make sense of this information, a viewer needs to know where to look. They need to know what the colors on the roadmap mean and how roadmap lanes get organized.\nThey also need to know that the roadmap they’re viewing isn’t outdated.\nGet Your Free Roadmap Template Guide ➜\nChoosing the right tool\nTools like Excel and Powerpoint open the door for too much variability when creating a roadmap. These tools fail to build effective roadmaps, so product managers must customize them to work for their needs.\nIt’s a minefield of possibility that’s difficult to reign in as your organization grows. The style and structure of your roadmaps evolve organically in different directions and become challenging to comprehend and combine. Coupled with the lack of version control, and your roadmap process becomes a roadmap mess.\nUsing native roadmap software, like ProductPlan, provides immediate structure to how your team roadmaps. Think of a roadmapping tool as a pre-built foundation and frame. The frame gives your roadmaps reliability and strength while also still leaving room for customization and creativity. By adopting a roadmapping tool, your roadmaps will all live in a single space. They will follow a consistent style and structure.\nStandardize the Style and Structure of Your Roadmaps\nRoadmap legends help you visually communicate strategic goals. With just a pop of color, you can organize your roadmap by initiatives that increase customer satisfaction. You can create more revenue opportunities or enhance your product’s performance.\nIt can be difficult to keep these legends uniform when you have a team of product managers who each create and maintain their own roadmaps. If every roadmap uses a different visual vocabulary for communicating the same information, the result is a set of roadmaps that require time and energy to learn to read, and worse, can’t be compared or combined into a high-level portfolio view without a lot of work to remedy inconsistencies.\nMany of our customers have felt this pain firsthand. It’s why we built Shared Legends, a way for you to standardize the style and structure of your roadmaps.\nWith Shared Legends, you can create a centrally managed legend that can apply to any existing roadmap with just a few clicks. Rather than developing legends themselves, your product team can easily follow best practices and use the legends agreed upon by your organization.\nEven better, you only need to update your shared legend once to cascade that update to every other roadmap using that legend. Instead of hounding your product team to make the same update countless times, you can rest assured that everyone on the team is following best practices and using the same legend.\nStandardize the Information Included in Your Roadmap Details\nYou don’t want to create consistency in the style and structure of your roadmaps. You also want to predict the kinds of information people can expect to find when they go to your roadmap with questions.\nWithin the details of every roadmap bar, we provide a space for you to include additional information to help roadmap viewers understand “what” the product team is building and why they’re building it, who they’re building it for, and other essential information.\nIf left to their own devices, product managers will likely provide the information they deem most relevant. They perceive this through the information they care about the most. On the other hand, they can determine by asking themselves the questions they’ve most often received from others. Either way, it’s unlikely that the information provided within each initiative will be the same across your team. Product managers need to find a way to properly align expectations.\nCustom Fields\nWith ProductPlan’s custom fields, you can designate a space for the information you want your product team to include on every roadmap bar. Maybe your team needs to keep track of the success metrics tied to each initiative. Or perhaps your senior leaders want to see the budget allocated for each priority.\nRather than answer these questions individually over and over, you can direct team members to your roadmap and allow it to speak for you. Over time, team members will build a habit of checking the roadmap first rather than interrupting work. The assurance will provide you and your team with more time to focus on strategic initiatives, speaking with customers, launching new products, exploring new market opportunities. The freed-up time will allow product managers to work on addressing things that need quick prioritization.\nStandardize How Your Team Decides What to Build Next\nPrioritization can be a painstaking process. There are so many inputs to consider, from a mountain of customer feedback to features that your executive team believes will drive the business forward to your ideas around what innovations could attract entire markets of new customers.\nWithout an agreed-upon way to decide what to build next, it’s easy to fall into the trap of reacting to what others ask for rather than what your product strategy dictates. It’s even easier for each product manager on your team to prioritize something different based on their assessment of what’s essential and what’s not.\nWe want to help you bring standardization to how you prioritize roadmap initiatives. The ProductPlan prioritization board allows your team to objectively score opportunities based on a customizable set of benefit and cost categories.\nMaybe your company has a business goal to increase revenue from a particular segment of customers. With the prioritization board, you can easily include that consideration as a benefit. You can then customize how to compare to other initiatives and consider how they might factor into deprioritization. For example, operational costs or the amount of development work required can also add to your prioritization framework as a cost.\nThe prioritization board helps your product managers stay laser-focused on your company’s most important priorities. It also provides new product managers on your team with an accessible template for learning what should be top-of-mind considerations when deciding what to build next.\nStandardize Your Roadmap to Communicate with Different Audiences\nProductPlan’s tags are an easy way to categorize and filter your roadmap based on custom information. Indeed, not every initiative on a roadmap will be relevant to every kind of audience.\nTags aren’t helpful if they aren’t implemented consistently across your various roadmaps.\nTags highlight particular stories about your product strategy. For example, your customer success team might want to know which features support a specific set of customers. Your marketing team may need a release overview for August so they can plan their go-to-market strategy. Tags add these additional details to your roadmap and then filter your roadmaps by this information.\nUnfortunately, without standardizing how your team uses them, tags can quickly become a source of disorganization and confusion. In an attempt to create an August release overview, your product team might unintentionally create multiple variations of the same tag. Some roadmap items might be tagged with “Aug” while others tagged with “August Release.” Anyone who wants to see an overview of everything releasing in August will need to be aware of these variations.\nCentralized Tag Manager\nYou should be able to keep your tags organized and avoid redundancy, confusion, and error. If you’re a Professional or Enterprise customer, we provide you with a place to do this. We call our centralized tag manager.\nWith the ProductPlan tag manager, you can easily manage the tags used to highlight product owners, dependencies, release statuses, and more. The manager defines which tags pertain to which kinds of information, merge similar tags to avoid confusion, and deletes any tag your team shouldn’t use.\nIt may sound obvious, but making it easy for your audience to access the information most relevant to them is critical in keeping your team aligned, delivery schedules on time, and your roadmaps in use. Without a way to readily view this information, many will either rely on inefficient methods of getting the information they need – like asking the same questions of your product team over and over again – or move forward in ignorance. Neither of these outcomes is acceptable, especially as your organization scales.\nStreamline Your Product Roadmap\nUltimately, roadmaps that have a standardized style and structure communicate information in the same way. They use a common vocabulary to express goals, identify priorities, highlight dependencies, and more. When you take the time to create consistent processes for building and maintaining your roadmaps, you reduce the cognitive load these tasks require. The freed-up time allows your team to focus on more important things, like speaking with customers, drilling into market research, and otherwise working on ways to improve your product.\nIt’s important to understand that standardization is an investment. It requires more work upfront to create less work overall over time. Unfortunately, many organizations realize the need for standardization too late, often when existing processes break down as the organization scales.\nWith ProductPlan’s roadmapping platform, you can create a foundation of guidelines that build consistency and predictability within your organization over time. Our suite of standardization features ensures your roadmaps are produced by the best practices you’ve established, making it easy for your team to stay aligned, work efficiently, and gather the information they need to be better at their jobs.\nRead the Strategic Roadmap Planning Guide ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/standardize-roadmaps/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925786727,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"5 Ways to Become a Better Product Advocate Within Your Company","text":"\n I recently did a webinar with Pragmatic Marketing on the topic of thought leadership for product managers. One of the most interesting questions I received from our audience was actually not about thought leadership at all, but about about internal product advocacy.\nThe question was essentially, “How do you win executive buy-in to work on an innovative idea that risks cannibalizing some of your existing product line?”\nAlthough a portion of my webinar — called How Thought Leadership Can Elevate Your Products and Career — was about becoming a better internal product advocate, the majority of my focus was on why it’s so valuable for product managers to establish themselves as public thought leaders in their industries. That portion of the webinar unveiled a lot of great questions as well, and a lively discussion.\nBut that attendee’s question got me thinking about what I believe is an important part of product management: Learning how to be an effective internal product advocate.\nYet in all of our discussions about the many important roles of product managers — learning about customers, knowing the competitive landscape, communicating with stakeholders and developers, championing their products publicly — I think we often forget just how vital it is to champion those products internally as well, across the entire company.\nAs a product manager, you are your product’s internal champion—whether you realize it or not\nAnother interesting insight that came out of our Pragmatic Marketing webinar was that more than 60% of attendees, whom we polled in real-time, said that it was the product manager who most often promoted the product internally in their organizations. In fact, the next most common internal product advocates — marketing and sales — were cited by just 16% of attendees, while product executives were cited by only 12% of attendees.\nThis tracks with my own experience in product management, where I’ve helped to launch several products. It’s also consistent with what I’ve learned as a founder at ProductPlan, where I’ve had the chance to work with product managers across dozens of industries.\nTweet This:\n“As a product manager, the responsibility falls on you to be your product’s internal champion.”\nThe bottom line is this: As a product manager, the responsibility will likely fall to you to be your product’s internal champion. Which means if you don’t advocate regularly and persuasively for your products across your organization, your products will likely have no internal champion. Here’s why that can be detrimental for your products and your company.\nWhy your products need an internal advocate\nUltimately, being an internal advocate for your products will help you build better products.\nAs a product manager, you are often facing competing agendas within your company, budgetary and resource constraints of your own, and general inertia across your company during the long process of bringing a product to market.\nBy being an ongoing advocate of your product with executives, developers, the marketing and sales departments, the customer success team, your investors, and other relevant groups within your organization, you will create a much better chance that your product will receive the benefit of everyone’s A-game throughout its development.\nAs we’ve asserted in previous posts here at ProductPlan, like this one, it’s easy for everyone to feel enthusiastic and optimistic during an initial strategy meeting. But that early-stage excitement will inevitably wane, and it will then fall to someone — that means you, the internal product advocate — to maintain the advocacy and cheerleading throughout the development process that keeps everyone pumped for the product’s eventual release.\nAnother reason an internal product advocate is so vital to the product’s success is to help ensure everyone involved stays focused on the big-picture strategic goals — and teams don’t get lost in the tactical details and minutiae. Because you can’t oversee every aspect of your product’s development, you will need to trust your various teams to make some strategic decisions in real time — and the more you are there to advocate internally for your product’s vision and strategic objectives, the more likely those other teams’ decisions will reflect those bigger-picture goals.\nHow to be an effective internal product advocate\nSo how do you pull it off? How can you become an effective product advocate within your company? Here are some suggestions.\n1. Share with your company your product’s high-level strategic vision.\nWhen you speak with colleagues across your organization about your product in terms of features, you’ll have a hard time generating and maintaining enthusiasm — particularly among those groups who don’t understand all of the details of those features, or your market’s need for them.\nSo instead, try to keep your communications across your organization higher-level — talk about the market problems your products will solve, the value added to your customers, and how the product will earn your company market share, revenue and a leadership role in the industry.\nAlso, if the teams working on your products push back on your objectives or requests, and you can tie those requests back to the product’s larger-picture strategic vision, you’ll have a better chance of bringing those teams over to your side.\n2. Tailor your product advocacy specifically to the people and teams you’re talking with.\nAt ProductPlan, in our conversations about roadmapping with product managers, we often find that executive stakeholders don’t want to hear about a product’s details. That’s just one of many examples of why it’s so important to tailor your conversations about your products to the groups you’re speaking with. You’ll be a much more effective advocate for your products if you advocate for them in a language that resonates with your audience.\nWhen you’re talking with sales or marketing, for example, you’ll want to emphasize how your product will help solve problems for the personas they’ll be selling and marketing to. For your executives, on the other hand, your product advocacy should emphasize the product’s eventual revenue to the company, or its ability to bring your company into new markets.\nThis is also why we at ProductPlan are big advocates of visual, web-based product roadmaps. When you’re speaking with several different audiences — developers, executives, etc. — you don’t want to have only one view of your roadmap. You want to be able to quickly change the focus and the level of detail based on who you’re talking to.\nDownload Building Your First Product Roadmap ➜\n3. Make a habit of weaving product advocacy into everything you do.\nBecoming an effective internal product advocate means you’re always an internal product advocate — not only when you’re called on to speak. You have to make it a part of your job to be on the lookout for opportunities to champion your product across your company.\nAnd you can find these opportunities everywhere.\nTweet This:\n“Make a habit of weaving product advocacy into everything you do as a product manager.”\nLet’s say you find a blog post or industry research report about the fact that your customer persona is on the rise, or that a problem that your product will ultimately solve is growing. Copy people across your company — your development team, your sales team, your leadership team. Let them know, “Hey, looks like we’re onto something here!”\nDon’t expect your teams to stay internally motivated from day to day. Life gets in the way of that. So use these pieces of market data wherever you can to help keep your teams’ enthusiasm levels high, and give them the day-to-day incentive they’ll need to keep doing their best work, during the long period between that exciting kickoff meeting… and release day.\n4. Spread good product news across your company every chance you get.\nAnother great way to keep your internal teams motivated and enthused about your products is to share good news about those products as often as you can. If your sales team closes a big deal, send that news out to the company. If your product gets an honorable mention in the trade or business media, share that across the company.\nAnd if you find a positive comment or quote about your product from an actual user? For goodness sake, jump up on your desk and shout it to everyone within earshot. (Or just email or Slack it to everyone.)\nHearing that your product is succeeding out in the marketplace, solving real problems for your market and winning fans among your customer personas, puts a human touch on what otherwise might often feel like abstract work for your teams. Let them know that the work they’re doing is making a positive difference in people’s lives.\n5. Hold regular product meetings to keep everyone informed.\nOften the simple act of bringing everyone together to discuss your product’s progress and to remind them about the big-picture strategic goals can provide a tremendous boost in company enthusiasm for the product.\nOne of the things I encourage product managers to do is to hold regular meetings with the various stakeholder groups, such as marketing, sales, customer support, engineering, etc. These get-togethers are also a great chance to give both progress updates and much-needed context to the work everyone is doing. It’s in these meetings, for example, that you can discuss what you’ve learned from your trips out to talk with customers — what your users like about your product, for example, and what they’d really like to see added to it.\nAgain, what you’re doing here is taking what might otherwise feel like a series of abstract disconnected tasks — adding this feature, changing this screen, fixing these bugs — and turning them into important projects that will be improving the way real customers, real people, will be able to work (or play or do whatever your product lets them).\nI also recommend that product managers record their sessions with customers. This gives them something to show their internal teams back home, and those videos can really help teams put a human face to the problem they’re being asked to solve with their product development work. The more real-world information you can share with your internal teams, the more they’ll have a chance to see the big picture — and the more enthusiasm they’ll be able to bring to their work.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nAdvocate, Advocate, Advocate for Your Products!\nBringing a product to market successfully is an incredibly challenging balancing act — weighing priorities, limited resources and pressures against other priorities, limited resources and pressures. The more support you can elicit from across your company, the more your disparate teams are aligned in their mission to bring your strategic goals to reality, and the better your chances of a successful product.\nBut that takes internal product advocacy — ongoing championing of your products every chance you get. So if I had to sum up my advice here in one sentence, it would be this: Always be advocating.\nHave you found other methods of internal product advocacy that work for you?

The first was acquired and thrives today with products such as GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar. The second one, AppFolio, went public and also thrives with its software for property management companies and law firms.\nThe key takeaway from watching each of these companies grow from roughly 10 employees to 600+ each is this: It’s all about building relationships. It is just like exercise. If we exercise regularly, a side effect is that our diet typically improves. If we build relationships and really know and care about the people we work with, everything else comes easier.\nSo how can we build relationships on our product development teams and thrive? Here are five ways.\n1. Sit Together\nAt my first startup, engineering and product development teams sat separately, and we all had our own individual offices. As our departments grew, we were spread even farther from each other. As a result, informal interactions between different groups went away, or became more challenging. Our communication would primarily take place over email or on the phone. Our engineering and product groups would only meet weekly or biweekly to review progress. We’d attempt to “be on the same page”, and that “page” was typically a schedule expressed in Microsoft Project. We weren’t exactly “strangers” but we really didn’t “know each other”.\nWe learned — when we don’t see the people we work with on a regular basis, we make assumptions and distance grows — “us” and “them”; and “we” and “they” language emerges. Working together becomes harder.\nYears later at AppFolio, my second startup, we hired Jason, the product manager I worked with closely at the first startup. At that time, our entire company was in one room with an open floor plan. We’d have casual conversations, and share the antics of pranking people’s desks when they went out on vacation. Once when Jason was out we upgraded his computer with the latest hardware from the 80s as shown below! We were all thrilled when our property manager software was fired up on his screen. It was a fun moment for everyone, including Jason. It felt like we were all on “one team” when we were in the same room.\nJason returns from vacation to find a “state-of-the-art” computer setup on his desk.\nI remember reflecting with Jason about being together with our groups in the same space at AppFolio versus being in different wings of a building when we were at the first startup. From there, we made a pact that our groups — engineering and product — would all sit together in the same open space going forward. It’s now about nine years later, and we still work in open areas and are together as cross-functional teams of engineers, QA, UX, product managers, and agile coaches.\nExample of a cross-functional team area at AppFolio.\nSitting together does not come easy if there are remote teams and offices. Workarounds such as Google Hangouts and GoToMeeting are available to help in such situations. We promote the use of video for our remote friends as it helps to level the playing field and bring us closer.\nView of our satellite office via Google Hangouts at AppFolio headquarters.\nView of AppFolio headquarters on screen via Google Hangouts from our LA office.\n2. Actively get to Know Each Other and Build Trust\nDoing activities to help get team members to know each other on a personal basis is an incredible strategy for team-building and raising the level of respect on teams.\nAt AppFolio, when we reteam or change up team membership, we have deliberate discussions about how we want to “be together” as a team. We determine what we want it to be like in our physical team spaces. We elicit team members’ preferences regarding communication and interruptions, and vision out the characteristics for our team in order to flourish. This includes understanding how we will operate when things get difficult. Because they “will” get difficult. This raises the positivity in the environment and makes conflict easier to bear. Examples are: team members’ desire to go together for a walk outside if they have a conflict, or to give “alone time” to someone you overheard having a challenging phone call. The book, Creating Intelligent Teams by Anne Rød and Marita Fridjhon, gets into the specifics of designing “team contracts” like mentioned above.\nWe also do many other activities to deliberately enhance the experience of getting to know one another and build trust. One of them is a modified version of the Market of Skills activity from Lyssa Adkins’s book, Coaching Agile Teams. If you walk through AppFolio today you are likely to find one of these Market of Skills posters hanging on a wall or the side of a desk.\nTeam getting to know each other via Market of Skills activity at AppFolio.\nWe also go on short outings together as a cross-functional team. We are fortunate to be located in Santa Barbara, California. I like to take teams out on hikes and combine it with sharing personal stories to bring us all closer.\nA favorite activity of mine is a “Fulfillment Hike”, an activity inspired by “Co-Active Coaching”. In this activity, we share with each other a “peak experience” in our lives about something that is personally meaningful to us. At the top of the hike, we stand or sit in a circle, and go around sharing the stories we heard from our partners. Together we derive the values from each of our stories and have a discussion about which values we would like to carry over into our daily work. We put up these values on a poster in our team area as a reminder of what we want.\nPhoto of cross-functional team on a hike up Inspiration Point trail in Santa Barbara.\nBy actively getting to know each other, we can empathize well with each other and can build great trust and camaraderie.\n3. Share and own Challenges Together\nDuring the early years of my first startup, waterfall-style development was the norm. Unable to predict, product development teams would promise a deadline but deliver late. Discussions about this topic were extremely stressful and difficult. The saving grace of this type of thing was to cut back scope (ideally) in order to get as close to the committed date as possible. Conversations about this topic between engineering and product groups couldn’t just happen on the fly. They needed to be “scheduled” due to the distance between our groups. This took time and elevated tensions among our groups.\nWe learned that our practices prevented us from sharing and owning challenges together. We had to fix that.\nFast forward to AppFolio… due to physical proximity and actively getting to know one another, product managers and engineers are more open and honest with each other. Product managers get a daily or even hourly understanding of where things are at. Everyone is present together in their work-area and at regular team events. We can even discuss our work challenges during a team hike while going through a physical challenge. The chance of having negative surprises is greatly reduced.\nExample of product development teams discussing work visualized on a board in their team area.\nCross-functional product development teams can also share the challenge of onboarding new team members. When team members share the mentorship of a new employee, the load is lighter. And, the person being mentored gets more attention, and is exposed to different styles of working. This can include cross-group mentoring. For example, experienced engineers can help out in mentoring new and experienced product managers.\nIn summary, we are stronger when we face challenges together — regardless of what group we are in, or what reporting structure we have. Helping each other succeed helps us realize our goal of delighting our customers with our product development roadmap.\nDownload the Product Development Roadmap Checklist ➜\n4. Help Each Other Succeed\nI remember talking to our AppFolio co-founder and CTO Jon Walker about a challenge I was having with a fellow team member. He looked at me and said, “Heidi, how can you make this person successful?” That simple phrase changed everything for me, and I’ve come back to it over and over again as I coach people around me. When we hire people, we want them to thrive and be successful. That’s why we hired them. Helping to educate team members on this simple yet powerful topic can make an incredible impact. When I hear complaints about another person, I even find myself echoing Jon by saying, “How can you help them be successful?”\nWhen I mentor people at AppFolio I like to teach them the concept of Net Promoter Score (NPS) applied to us as individuals. We use the concept of NPS with our AppFolio customers on a regular basis. It tells us how likely our customers are to recommend our software to other people, as well as collects qualitative comments that we analyze for improving our products. It comes from the book The Ultimate Question by Fred Reichheld. When applied to people, I encourage people to think about their behavior and actions and how they think others might perceive them in their teams and outside their teams. Are they “creating promoters” for themselves? What are the chances that their behavior will be championed by other people around them?\nTeaching team members tools and techniques for communication challenges they are experiencing is a great way to support them and to help them grow. In recent days I have been teaching managers techniques to use with people on their team to help prepare them for having what they perceive as “difficult” conversations with others. We do an empathy building exercise based on a modified “3rd entity” activity from Organizational Relationship Systems Coaching (ORSC).\nWhen you reteam at AppFolio, you have the opportunity to work and learn together with different people. But you might be used to the style of a particular team member and expect that the people on your new team will act in the same manner. This is the type of scenario you face with a fast-growing company like ours. Deliberately promoting the attitude to help one another encourages everyone to be “in it” together. This might mean building more patience and helping fellow team members along the way that are new to their roles. It also might mean putting our named “roles” aside and doing whatever to help the endeavor move forward.\n5. Have Outings and Learn Together\nAt the first startup, we had the tradition of having annual retreats where our engineering department would go camping, white water rafting or some other trip typically involving the outdoors. The tradition originated, according to our founder Klaus Schauser from an experience he had with a student group that he was a part of at UC Berkeley. AppFolio was co-founded by Klaus, and when we were a startup we continued this tech retreat tradition, starting with our inaugural retreat white water rafting on the Kern river.\nPhoto of AppFolio as a startup after its inaugural tech retreat rafting on the Kern river.\nSince we had the pact to always sit together with product and engineering, it seemed fitting to continue that vibe by inviting and having our product development teams go with us on every tech retreat. It’s now almost nine years later and the groups have gotten much larger. Still, all of the people who work on building the products together — engineers, QA, UX and product managers go on this annual trip together. It’s nothing short of epic! We have done camping at the Channel Islands together, white water rafting, high ropes, and have even been to Disneyland.\nTeams have quarterly budgets to do local events together as celebrations to mark milestones, or they can do them just for the sake of bonding and getting to know each other better. This organizational support has helped us thrive, especially for the years in which our engineering and product teams doubled in size.\nOften different groups also bond by going to conventions together, where we learn together and get to know each other in a setting apart from the office. We’d also plan and organize extra social events while in the corresponding city. Last year we were in Washington DC together, and we visited several sight seeing locations, and even rode a ferris wheel. In the photo below are two engineering directors, two agile coaches, three product managers, one UX engineer and one QA engineer. Having this shared learning and joyful experience brought us closer together and it was just plain fun.\nPhoto of team members after they rode a large ferris wheel in Washington D.C.\nSummary\nReflecting back on the experiences I have shared at both startups, I can tell you that relationship building is critical. As individuals, we are at our jobs to make money and to survive as independent people in the world. We spend more time at work typically than we do with our families. The time we spend with our co-workers, our friends, can include some of the most memorable and incredible times in our lives. We can work together and create incredible products for our customers, and love every minute of the experience together. If you know and care about the people you work with, everything else comes easier. \nAbout the Guest Author:\nHeidi Helfand has 17 years coaching and influencing cross-functional product development teams at pioneering web software companies.

They’ll have a major influence on their team, which affects the colleagues they interact with the most. While also having a significant impact on corporate goals, priorities, and tactics. Before hiring a product leader, you need to ensure that you understand the most essential product leadership interview questions that can help better inform your hiring decision. \nIt’s like when you hire a new head coach. They bring in some of their assistants, put individual contributors into new roles, and utilize their terminology and playbook, giving them an outsized effect on the entire organization.\nIf you’ve done it right, a new product leader will make you a little uncomfortable. They bring in some diverse opinions and the stature to share and back those up. Additionally, they’ll probably have a skill set that makes you a little insecure about your resume.\nThough you may feel insecure about a new product leader in the long term, the new hire will contribute to your product team. Ultimately, this uneasiness is what leads to growth and positive change. However, new product leaders do still need to fit in a little bit. Unless you genuinely want to rock the boat and shake things up in a big way.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nWhat Experience to Look for When Interviewing\nBefore you ever hop on the phone or a Zoom or meet in person with a candidate, you’ll already know plenty about their experience. There might be some career rehashing as part of the interviewing process. But they didn’t make it this far if their resume wasn’t a pretty good match for your needs.\nSo instead of fixating on their work history, get a feel for what makes them tick—your candidate’s motivations matter. You want to know what they like most and least about working in product to understand their passions and preferences.\n“Product” roles vary so much from one company to the next. Make sure their skills and interests align with what your organization needs from them. It’s also crucial that they’re excited about addressing your customer base’s specific challenges and needs.\nUnderstand How They’ll Fit with The Team\nEnvision what hiring them would mean for their team. Does the candidate address the underlying needs, and will they help the team grow?\nSoft skills are the other area that can’t be explored by simply looking at their LinkedIn profile. You can teach some product management fundamentals and train them on tools and processes—but you can’t teach curiosity and passion.\nYou’re looking for examples of how they’ve used their passion for a product to get things done in challenging environments, built consensus, and delighted customers. You want specifics about how they’ve overcome obstacles and expanded their knowledge. Learning about the meaningful impacts on the lives of their users are the “juicy bits” you’re looking to extract from your time together. \nNot Every Product Manager Should Be (or Wants to Be) a People Manager.\nGood salespeople often make terrible sales managers because the skills that help you close a deal are entirely different from those that help you motivate your staff. While there’s a little more overlap on the product side, the same dynamic is also in play. Someone who loves immersing themselves in the details of their specific domain may not have the mental and emotional skills to add value across multiple products and product staff at a higher level.\nWith this in mind, it’s important to remember that people can climb the corporate ladder without necessarily taking on people management duties. Paying attention to how candidates answer some of your questions can help you steer them into the more appropriate track.\nDownload Developing a Product Team Checklist ➜\nSome people thrive on identifying problems, connecting with customers, and getting into the weeds to find new opportunities. These folks are best suited for individual contributor roles. They will likely find people management responsibilities unfulfilling even if they think that’s the job they need to advance their career.\nOthers thrive on amplifying their impact. While they’re still passionate about solving customer problems, they’re interested in building out skills and processes for the whole team. They’re able to trust others and delegate so they can focus on the big picture. \n6 Product Leadership Interview Questions to Ask\nIn my experience, these are six of the most common questions that get asked. I’m also pointing out what you should pay attention to when they answer.\nQuestion 1: Tell me a story.\nThe best way to prove someone’s storytelling chops is to ask them to tell you one. Crafting a compelling narrative is an essential tool in generating consensus and enthusiasm for ideas. Thus, you’ll want to see how they do. \nI prefer a story describing an end-to-end production process and its results. So I’m looking for a few critical elements in their response:\nVerb selection: Did they “direct” or “collaborate”? Were they echoing the voice of the customer or just writing up product requirements? Is there some heart and emotion in their retelling? Or is it a simple regurgitation of the facts and events that transpired?\nData: Do you think this was the right project for your team? How did they measure success? Product managers can’t always measure the success of a product. Many companies are lacking in this area, so I don’t blame them if it’s lacking. But I want to see at least some awareness of the value of using metrics and how they considered implementing them. Plus, I want to make sure they’re not just quoting proxy metrics with no apparent correlation to the customer or business goals, as that’s a warning sign as well.\nExpansiveness and inclusiveness: How insular are they? Are they considering other stakeholders, departments, and customers in their processes? Product leadership is about more than bossing around your direct reports. You must also establish and value strong relationships with folks across the organization.\nQuestion 2: Which products do you love?\nThis question provides you a little peek behind the shiny veneer candidates who are cloaking themselves in during the interview process. An exact answer will reveal something about what matters to them and what draws their attention. Keep in mind that something vanilla and obvious signals a lack of depth and creativity.\nBesides just getting to know them as a person, it’s also a glimpse of what they appreciate as product professionals. Do they gravitate to generic products they use every day? Or are they more enthusiastic for brilliant technical or design solutions to tough challenges?\nTheir mentioned solutions truly energize the ideal candidate. Saying products that ingeniously yet quickly improve the lives of their customers while boasting a solid business model is critical. You have another opportunity to evaluate their storytelling skills.\nQuestion 3: A question about your product.\nThey’ve seen the solution (the product they’re interviewing to work on), and now you want to know if they can identify the customer problem it’s solving. It’s time to flip the script and let them show off their product management skills. \nIt’s also a chance to see if they’ve done their homework and understand what you’re trying to do. I want to know that they not only understand the concept but that they get the actual application. If they weren’t curious enough to dig into the job they’re interviewing for, will the candidate go the extra mile to communicate with the team effectively? \nYour product is a solution designed to address a customer challenge. How much of that customer problem could they intuit from the website or checking out the product itself? \nWe have an unfair advantage at ProductPlan since product managers are our actual customers. So there’s no excuse here if a candidate isn’t familiar with the customer problems we’re trying to solve. I’ll often ask them more pointed questions given that familiarity, such as probing into what additional value we could provide their product management team or what other opportunities and challenges lie ahead for us given their intimate understanding of the space.\nLearn how to grow a successful product team:\nQuestion 4: Describe your ideal workflow/relationship with User Experience and Engineering.\nThough there are no correct answers, you may find that there are also many wrong ones. Instead, this question puts a spotlight on their penchant for collaboration.\nEveryone comes to the table with their strengths—product understands the customer problem, UX lives to delight customers and creates frictionless user experiences. Engineering knows the technical boundaries and opportunities at hand. I want product leaders who recognize our collective strength lies in the sum of these parts. They’ll check their ego in the interest of jointly creating customer value.\nI honestly don’t care which processes candidates bring up, as long as they are logical workflows that incorporate stakeholder alignment and goal-driven outcomes. Making everyone feel like they’re an essential partner in the process is in many ways more vital than the process itself.\nWhat matters most here is breaking down silos, playing to people’s strengths to help them grow, and the flexibility to adapt to the situation at hand.\nQuestion 5: How do you prioritize?\nThere are dozens and dozens of ways to tackle this task, and once again, I’m not seeking any particular framework or methodology. I’m using it as a lens to see how they process information from various sources and turn that into a coherent vision.\nIn particular, I’m always wary of candidates coming from places where it was a top-down, CEO-calls-all-the-shots vibe. That type of environment limits a PM to just executing things. I’m also not interested in someone when they’ve just bounced around priorities based on whatever their most extensive and newest customers demanded.\nI’m looking for stakeholder alignment, rapid assessment of new developments, and (obviously) leaning on a solid roadmap to pull it all together. An objective element in the prioritization process (scoring, weighting, etc.) is also a big plus in their favor. \nQuestion 6 – Show me your superpowers. \nI rarely present an offer letter to a candidate that hasn’t illustrated how they work. While “test projects” have fallen out of favor, I still want to see their capabilities. To achieve this, I create scenarios to evaluate better how they’ll operate if they land the job. Time-box these so they don’t spin out into a lengthy assignment.\nFor example, I had a candidate with all the correct answers, yet they seemed more concerned about their own opinion than the necessary collaboration great products require. I created a scenario intentionally missing critical information. I was looking to see whether they asked questions or requested help instead of just barreling ahead without essential details.\nDon’t be afraid to throw a curveball.\nThrowing in a new piece of information halfway through a scenario is another excellent test of their mental agility. Product managers must deal with competitors launching out of the blue, unexpected customer requests, technical hurdles, and unanticipated market changes. How they adapt is a fantastic peek at their ability to remain strategic while remaining flexible in high-pressure situations.\nGiven the increasing number of remote teams—including our engineering team—not to mention the many companies that will remain remote until the last embers of COVID-19 die down, communication skills are at a premium. Navigating the communication styles and utilizing a product roadmap to ease communication amongst teams matters much more when everyone isn’t in the same room. \nOne scenario to test this is picking a near-term roadmap initiative and asking them to summarize who needs to be involved, when, and to what degree. A good barometer asks the potential new hire to pen a press release and an internal email.\nWhile not everyone will be thrilled about any of these “tests,” you can explain that these exercises significantly shorten interview times. It would help if you let them do some of it asynchronously. And, if they have work samples that would convey the same aspects of their work style and output, you should welcome them.\nQuality Over Quantity\nWhether you incorporate all, some, or none of the above questions into your product leader interviewing process, I urge you to concentrate on fewer, higher-quality questions over a barrage of smaller ones. You’ll get more meaningful data on which to base your decision. Candidates will also get a better sense of the environment they would be entering if hired.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-leadership-interview-questions/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925786997,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"6 Rules of Product Design According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs","text":"\n In this blog, we will discuss the applications of Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs to the world of product design and tips to use this model most effectively to create your product. But first, we must start with the theory itself.\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is a motivational theory in psychology created by U.S psychologist Abraham Maslow.  This theory was published in the academic journal Psychological Review in 1943 and is usually depicted using a five-tier model showing human needs in a pyramid diagram.\nThe needs at the bottom of the pyramid are the most basic. To progress to the next level, the current level must be satisfied. The needs are physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization from bottom to top.\nThe theory’s meaning.\nThe theory says that humans are motivated to fulfill basic needs before they move onto more advanced needs. For example, a person who has no food will not concentrate their time and resources seeking a loving relationship (belonging). They are instead evolutionarily compelled to meet their survival needs first (physiological).\nProduct Design and Maslow’s Theory\nOver time, Maslow’s theory has been adapted and applied in many new fields. These range from medical treatments to marketing. However, in this article, we will discuss its application to product design and planning.\nIn 2010, Steven Bradley created a translation of Maslow’s theory- the “Design Hierarchy of Needs.” As with the original theory, the basic needs of design must be met first to progress to the next stage. The five tiers of Bradley’s theory are functionality, reliability, usability, proficiency, and creativity.\nDesign Hierarchy of Needs\nSteven Bradley’s Design Hierarchy of Needs presents a useful and practical set of rules for creating new products and evaluating existing ones’ design. Moving through the process as you design a new product – be that a new piece of software or a tool to be used in the construction industry – is as simple as asking the questions each level implies.\nFunctionality — Does it work?\nReliability — Does it work when I need it to?\nUsability — Can I figure out how to make it work?\nProficiency — Can it show me how to make it work better?\nCreativity — How else can this work for me?\nThe key here is to ask designers and customers these questions and listen intently to the answers.\nThe 5 Levels and 6 Rules to Follow When Using Bradley’s Hierarchy of Needs in Product Design\nFulfilling each stage of the hierarchy of needs is about using logic to design a product that meets its purpose’s functional imperatives. However, it is also about exploring how a product can work for a user outside its core remit. Therefore, creating a comprehensively satisfying product.\nLevel 1 – Functionality\nThe most basic yet critical part of a product’s design is its functionality. Does the mug, chainsaw, security software, etc., fulfill its primary objective? If it does not, then there is little point advancing to the other stages of development.\nFor example, it matters little if a water glass is beautiful if it cannot hold water and be used for drinking. It is useless and, therefore, valueless to consumers.\nOrder management software we can use as a good example for the digital world. If you can’t order goods and services using the software, developers should not move on to creating complex suggestion features, as the core requirements need to be addressed first.\nThis process obviously becomes more complicated as the core utilities of the product get more complex. This is not mistakenly illustrated as the largest part of the pyramid and, thus, its foundation. As the diagram’s proportion suggests, most of the time and resources allotted to you should focus on fulfilling this part of the process. It’s important to keep your customers or users in mind and answer the key question of if the product serves its primary function.\nDownload the Essential Feature Kickoff Book ➜\nRule 1\nAlways conduct in-depth research into what your customers expect your product to be able to do. A good way to understand your product’s basic functionalities is consumer research.\nApart from direct forms such as surveys, social media listening can also help you learn about your audience and what they expect from your services. This is especially pertinent when designing complicated pieces of software or other multi-purpose products. Asking what your product’s minimum expectations are when it comes to its use should guide you to fulfill this most crucial of design stages.\nRead the Customer Interview Tool Box ➜\nLevel 2 – Reliability\nAlmost as fundamental to design as functionality is reliability. Can the user trust that the product will work 100% of the time? If a user does not trust your product to work each time required, are they likely to want to invest in it?\nWhen it comes to creating a reliable product, the key is thorough testing. However, continue testing to ensure that it works time and time again in the same conditions. Testing should be as varied as possible.\nHower products mean little without the systems to support them. Therefore, a small tip to be aware of is to make sure that your product/service is reliable and that the various systems that support it are too.\nA good way to improve performance and reliability when it comes to, for example, the workforce that supports your product is to employ the use of WFO solutions. These integrated solutions will allow you to monitor customer demand and how well your team meets it.\nRule 2\nTest Test Test.\nAs mentioned, creating a reliable product involves a great deal of testing. There are four types of reliability testing that you should take into account.\nThe types of reliability testing are:\nDiscovery Testing:  This is the type of testing concerned with determining the boundaries for given inputs or stresses.\nLife testing: This type of testing looks at how a product will perform over its lifetime and through regular use.\nEnvironmental Testing: This type of testing looks at what set of stresses and conditions your product will expect the customer to work under.\nRegulatory testing – This testing, although not usually associated with those mentioned above, is an important set of tests that look at the product’s key functions for compliance and safety. Failure to meet regulatory testing usually means a product may need to be removed from the market.\nGet the Product Innovation and Experimentation Checklist ➜\nLevel 3- Usability\nThis need stresses the ability of people to use your product with ease. Can the user figure out how to use your product and each of its functions with minimal instruction?\nFor example, a new set of Bluetooth speakers are always relied on to amplify music through a Bluetooth-compatible device. However, if users find syncing their mobile device and controlling volume unintuitive, your product may struggle to win users’ approval.\nAnother more complex example would be a telephone IRV system. The best IVR meaning or definition is an automated telephone menu system that enables callers to be directed to the appropriate service quickly without being routed by a human, thus saving companies time and money.\nThis system needs to interact with callers and direct them to the correct information or human service but needs to do so in a user-friendly way. If the service is not designed with usability at its core, people will not want to use the service again.\nRule 3\nNever think of instructions as an afterthought.\nDeveloping quality instructions and literature to accompany your product is a vital part of the project. Put considered time and effort into explaining how to use your product as clear and well ordered as possible.\nThe trick is not to assume that customers have any prior knowledge about the product. Start from the basics and work up toward the more complicated functions.\nLevel 4 – Proficiency\nWith this need, we start to understand what makes a really good design. To satisfy this tier, designers need to ask themselves if a product’s design helps users become better at using that product. This need is especially relevant to computer software such as booking systems or review apps.\nFor example, a photo editing app designed for your phone could fulfill this need by suggesting tools and effects as you interact with the app. In addition to suggestions, it might also provide tutorials on various aspects of its app. Therefore, by using the app, you also get better at understanding its full range of functions.\nRule 4\nAlways be thinking, ‘what else could this product do?’.\nA helpful way to think of proficiency in design is by considering if something empowers the user to do more than the product’s basic function.\nDoes it lead you to discover a new and better way of doing things? Is it, in a sense, progressive? With each interaction with the device, does the user discover more about its capabilities? Keeping the idea of expansion and forward motion can give designers a good visual idea of design proficiency.\nLevel 5- Creativity\nHaving proved that a product can reliably perform its core duties, the next step is to fulfill other needs through an injection of innovation. Take running shoes, for example. Their main function is to provide support and traction to users whilst running. You could argue that they also need to be comfortable and well made.\nHowever, truly appealing running shoes on the market satisfy these needs amply and fulfill less tangible needs.\nDesirable running shoes are aesthetically pleasing in a variety of colors and styles. In addition to running shoes needing to perform, they also need to fulfill the customer’s desire to own something visually stimulating.\nThis has its own parallel to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Once a human has the basics – in this case, the shoes work well to run in – they will then look to more complicated needs. For example, what do these shoes say about who I am? How can these shoes imply my social status?\nRule 5 \nGet Creative\nCreativity is about going beyond the strict necessities of a product and looking for inventive ways to fulfill the customer’s needs.\nWrapping up and the final rule\nAs shown above, Bradley’s design hierarchy is a useful process for thinking of most products’ design aspirations. However, like Maslow’s original theory, which had its own catalog of critics, Bradley’s is not perfect, either.\nCriticisms for the Design Hierarchy of Needs include questions like: does a design have to be reliable before it can be usable? Can’t both criteria be met simultaneously?\nAlso, will markets tolerate products that work 90% of the time or even 80%, as long as the function is good? For example, we often forgive our laptops the occasional glitch because we realize the complexity of tasks they undertake.\nRule 6 \nThe hierarchy of design needs is by no means perfect and cannot be relied upon for every product design aspect.\nThe Maslow-inspired Design Hierarchy of Needs is an excellent place to start for product design, and you could do much worse than base your design upon its structures. However, the finer minutiae of products will need further research beyond this paradigm.\nOne of these finer levels that could be added to the pyramid, for example, is the use of history or story in your product or service. Often customers like to buy products that have prestige or tradition implied in their name.\nFinally, we create products for human needs. Therefore, it follows that Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and any other psychological work looking at human necessities – basic and complex – have a wealth of translatable knowledge applied to the world of product design.\nDownload the Anatomy of a Product Launch ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-design-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925763329,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"6 Things Product Managers Can Do with Qualitative Research","text":"\n We are excited to welcome guest writer Carlos González de Villaumbrosia to the ProductPlan blog. Carlos González de Villaumbrosia has over 10 years of experience building teams and digital products in the US, Europe, and Latin America. Carlos founded Product School in San Francisco in 2014. Today, the company is the global leader in product management training with 20 campuses worldwide and a live online campus.\nWhat is Qualitative Research?\nQualitative data is sometimes referred to as ‘soft data’ and is usually described as the exact opposite of quantitative data: the numbers. Quantitative includes the hard facts; things like demographics, statistics, and other kinds of ‘hard data.’\nThis form of user research fills in the gaps that hard data can’t. It tells you about your customer’s opinions, what they’re thinking, and how they feel about your product. Modern product managers are often encouraged to be as data-driven as possible, and may instinctively want to turn to the numbers, but great products require both types. You need to know what feelings your product evokes in users as much as you need that full Google Analytics report.\nLet’s take a look at what product managers need qualitative data for and how to do it right!\nQualitative Research Methods\nThe best qualitative research method for your product depends on a variety of factors. Before you set out choosing your method, look at how much time you can spend on it and how many resources you can afford to use.\nSurveys and forms: An easy and scalable way to collect data.\nCustomer interviews: A good way to get in-depth feedback, but takes time and resources.\nFocus groups: More time effective than one-to-ones, but less effective than surveys. More commonly used for physical products.\nEthnographic research: Observations of your customer’s environment (demographics, geography, infrastructures, culture, etc.) Useful for breaking into brand new markets.\nApp store reviews: Sometimes the qualitative data comes to you!\nSmaller startups may only be able to use one or two efficient and cheap methods, whereas massive companies will be able to do much more. If you’re in the former category, don’t spend all of your resources running endless focus groups, but make sure you invest in a proper discovery phase. Finding that balance is a key product manager responsibility!\nDownload My Customer Interview Tool Box ➜\n6 Things Product Managers Can Do with Qualitative Research\n1. Back it up with quantitative data\nWhen you’re conducting qualitative research, should you believe every word your customers say? Well, no not really!\nSometimes customers don’t know what they want. They may think that, in theory, they’re willing to pay $12.99 per month for a subscription service. But when the time comes to put in their credit card details, many will hesitate. Abandoned carts are a huge challenge to overcome in eCommerce, as everyone is eager to buy…until the point of purchase.\nMany companies, such at Netflix, find that giving customers what they were begging for, barely increases retention. That’s why you need to cross reference your quantitative and qualitative data. If you’re seeing a trend in the answers to your surveys, then back them up by checking the hard data.\nThe key here is to know which questions to ask. The answer to “do you like this product?” may not be the same as “would you be willing to pay for this product?”\n2. Use it to find your ‘Why’\nOne of your main duties as a product manager is to focus on the ‘why’ of the product. Or rather, making sure that your ‘why’ both solves a real problem and that you’re building the right product for it.\nThere’s no better way of understanding your customer’s problem than to ask them about it. If you see a problem that needs to be solved, ask your target market questions like:\nWhat are the main roadblocks in achieving X?\nWhat other solutions do you know of/have tried?\nWhat do you envision being the solution for X?\nWould you be willing to pay for a tool that does X?\nTo learn how to build your own data-driven roadmap, watch ProductPlan’s webinar:\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\n3. Use it to challenge your assumptions\nOn the flip side, if you’re seeing a trend in your data, you can back it up with what customers are telling you in the surveys. Never assume anything in product! Qualitative data is used to challenge your assumptions no matter where you are in the product life cycle.\nFor example, you might be seeing that a lot of your customers are failing to use one of your features. You might assume that’s because they hate the feature and you need to redesign the whole thing. But when you go into your surveys, your customers tell you that they didn’t even realize it was there! That leaves you with a relatively simple UI redesign to do, rather than a huge feature overhaul.\n4. Use it with your product marketing manager\nMarketing needs to be built into your product from the beginning, which means you need to have a close relationship with your product marketing manager.\nTogether, you create a powerhouse of growth for your company, because you can both benefit from qualitative research. It’ll help inform your communication style with your customers, making marketing significantly easier, and help you build feedback loops into your product.\n5. Use it to build your minimum viable product\nA Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a great learning tool, and gets you feedback on what users want. But if you can build it based on user feedback you’ll be one step head! If you start gathering data from your target market when you don’t even have a launched product or a user base yet, you’ll have the advantage.\nThis exercise will also be vital for finding your product-market fit. A story we see repeated time and time again, is that someone has an idea, they build what they want, and then see if people like it. Sometimes they hit it out of the park straight away, but more often they have to pivot in a different direction.\nBy using qualitative data to inform how you build your MVP, you’ll save yourself time and resources, making your time to market that much quicker.\n6. Use it for post-launch feedback\nAll the best product leaders know that their job isn’t done after your initial product launch! Once you’ve finished popping champagne bottles, it’s time to find out what people think.\nThe most common form of qualitative research done at this point is a user-feedback survey, much like those you may have conducted with your MVP. This will help you figure out how well you listened to, and understood, your customers the first time around. Did your product fix their problem? Is it easy to use? Is there a reason some downloaded and uninstalled it within a day?\nIf you have an app, you’re also likely to collect reviews. Don’t just go off the immediate reviews after launch. Early adopters tend to be quite techy and may have vastly different opinions to users who onboard further down the line. Your reviews are a great source of qualitative information, which you can keep referring back to throughout your product’s lifecycle.\nGetting Qualitative Research Right\nHave a plan. Set out what questions you need the answer to (big and small!) and take stock of your resources.\nSet a time limit. You’ll always think of other things to ask, but eventually you’ll reach the point where you just need to build. When using qualitative research to build your MVP, or at the start of a new feature, set a time limit for your research phase.\nDon’t just use your favorite customers. You need to have a good mix. It’s a great ego-stroke to interview people who sing our praises, but you need a balanced mix of opinions.\nAsk open-ended questions. Yes/No questions usually won’t give you the depth you need. Ask detailed questions that give you plenty of information to work with. Here are 10 great questions you should ask customers.\nRead the Customer Interview Tool Box\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-managers-qualitative-research/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925744402,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"6 Tips for Building Your First Launch Checklist in ProductPlan","text":"\n Many of the customers we work with talk about their frustration with how they bring new products and features to the market. For some, launching a new product feels like an afterthought without a defined process. For others, a product launch is tossed over the fence to marketing, and what happens after that is a mystery.\nWe want to help product people create thoughtful and repeatable plans for their next launch. We’ve introduced Launch Management (currently in open beta), a new space in ProductPlan to plan, track, and share your upcoming launches.\nOne of the key parts of Launch Management is the Launch Checklist, where you can work with your go-to-market team to decide what needs to be done to ensure your launch’s success. But how do you build a Launch Checklist? What should you include? How do you tailor the deliverables for the needs of your product, your audience, and your team?\nTo help you, we’ve developed 6 tips for building your first launch checklist within ProductPlan. Read on to learn more!\n1. Start Your First Launch Checklist With a List of Deliverables From a Previous Launch\nAfter you create your first launch within ProductPlan, you’ll see what is perhaps a daunting blank slate of a launch checklist. Eventually, we will help you get started by populating your checklist with several task ideas that you could consider to help you launch your next product. But for now, the checklist remains blank, and you’ll have to build a list of launch tasks on your own.\nBut fear not. Your first launch created in ProductPlan is likely not the first launch you’ve experienced. If it’s not your first launch, we highly recommend you start your launch checklist by bringing over a list of tasks from a past launch. It doesn’t matter if they live in a spreadsheet, a slide, or even in your head.\nWhat matters is you create something that you can see in ProductPlan. Play with it. Begin to build out a list of options for what could go into your next launch. Once you have that, you can share it with your teammates and get feedback. Every launch is different, so there will always be a bit of tweaking based on the launch goal, the product or feature launched, the target audience, and more.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Strategy Workbook➜\n2. Start Your Launch List Early and Get Feedback From Your Launch Stakeholders\nAs a product person, you might feel it’s your job to decide everything that should go into your next launch. You are the product expert, after all. But as you know, many launches involve work far beyond the conventional realm of product management. For example, there will be marketing campaigns to create product visibility and adoption, sales campaigns to acquire new customers, and support articles to help current customers understand how to use the latest thing you’ve built.\nYou likely won’t be the expert on every task required to launch a product. So as you begin to build out your launch checklist, we encourage you to add members of your team to collaborate with you.\nBy creating visibility into your launch checklist, you can spark conversations about the appropriate tasks required to ensure success. Field new ideas for training your internal teams on the latest product or find opportunities to communicate changes to new and existing customers.\nSuccessfully launching a product is everyone’s responsibility – not just the product team’s. All people involved in the launch should own the quality and completion of their deliverables and the outcomes they aim to achieve. It would help if you also involved your stakeholders early in the process.\n3. Launch Deliverables Should Have a Single Owner\nIt’s unlikely that every launch task will only require work from one person, and there will be many instances where an individual task may have multiple contributors. Take, for example, an enablement deck for your sales team. A project like this could involve a sales engineer, product marketing, and even a select group of salespeople for shaping and feedback.\nDespite this, we’ve found it is best to select one person (not one team) responsible for driving the task forward, reporting on progress, and ensuring it is completed on time. Either the selected person is doing the bulk of the work, or it could be the person who manages the team responsible for the work.\nEither way, a single owner means you know who to turn to when you need an update, and it also helps you create greater accountability among your go-to-market team.\n4. Create a Playbook for Each Kind of Launch You Manage\nOne of the best ways to create a consistent, repeatable, and thoughtful launch process is to create playbooks for each kind of launch you manage. Of course, not all launches are created equal, so they shouldn’t receive the same treatment. Some will require more resources, and others can provide a more significant opportunity for product adoption and engagement. In contrast, others are a footnote only relevant to a specific list of customers.\nTo spend less time planning and more time executing, it helps to come up with a system to categorize your launches. Here are a few recommended ways you can go about it:\nCategorize your launch into tiers (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, etc.) based on the number of resources and effort required. The tiers are a great way to help you prioritize launches, especially when you have more than one happening around the same time.\nCategorize your launches based on who they impact the most. Does your launch matter more to your existing customer base? Or does your launch provide you an opportunity to acquire new customers? Answering these questions can help you determine the kinds of launch tasks required.\nThink about what you’re launching regarding how it helps your business. Does it close a feature gap between you and your competitors? Or does your new product create a competitive advantage? Another way to think about this is whether what you’re launching is something your market expects or finds delightful.\nRegardless of how you choose to categorize your launches, the important thing is to build a playbook for each. Think about the tasks required for each category of launch and document them. Now, whenever you begin planning the launch of a new product or feature, you can categorize your launch and start running with an already-established playbook.\n5. Choose Fully Deliverable Tasks\nEvery launch task will likely require a few subtasks to complete. For example, an in-app onboarding flow might require a series of product images. Which begs the question: what level of tasks should you include in Launch Management?\nWe recommend only including tasks that represent a fully completed deliverable. Because you will be wrangling a wide range of deliverables from different teams and stakeholders, you don’t want to over-clutter your launch checklist. It also gives the person responsible for the tasks the ownership and discernment to determine what is necessary and sufficient for that deliverable to succeed.\n6. Create a Cadence to Review the Launch Checklist and “Check-off” What’s Complete\nTiming is one of the most critical elements of any launch. From the first product development task to the final marketing material, there’s a crucial timeline for when things are assigned and completed. Knowing these tasks need to be managed by various stakeholders requires a release of control and setting expectations. When will you review the checklists as the launch owner and ensure things are running on schedule?\nWhether your releases come each sprint, quarterly, or annually will determine the right cadence for you. You must regularly check in with the task owner and overall product launch owner. Whether in weekly meetings or managed asynchronously, setting expectations is crucial. You’ll want to ensure stakeholders are checking off tasks promptly. Though you need to ensure they don’t feel the added pressure of managing the minutia of each task.\nSimply put, building a launch checklist aims to make your life as a product person more manageable. This provides you with a single place to oversee and drill into the details of each launch. It would help if you encouraged other team members to contribute and share ownership.\nAs Launch Management is currently in beta, please share your feedback and best practices you learn as you work on your Checklists!\nBuild a roadmap ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/building-launch-checklist/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925804091,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"8 Blogs Product Managers Should Bookmark Immediately","text":"\n \n At ProductPlan, we’re big fans of blogs.

They want to convey the big picture but are stuck in the weeds. You might relate to the struggles below:\nSpreadsheets are great for organizing and prioritizing but bad for communicating a vision\nPresentations take time to produce and are static documents that are hard to share\nWikis and other documents are disjointed and hard to keep updated\nGetting company alignment is an uphill battle\nThere is rarely a single source of roadmap truth\nIn that sense, a good product roadmap is a polestar for product teams. It keeps us connected to the longer-term vision so that we don’t get lost in the day-to-day. It’s the strategic counterpart to task lists and opportunity backlogs.\nA Step-By-Step Guide to Assembling Your Product Roadmap\n1. Collect Inputs\nWe start by collecting inputs. Inputs come from different sources. Customers are constantly giving their input. We’re gaining insights and gathering information from our key internal stakeholders (like the sales and marketing teams), as well as key external stakeholders (like our investors). We have to collect data and analyze that data. We’re looking to our competitors, both existing and new, and we’re looking to the cultural landscape and the technology trends that are emerging.\nAll of that information is coming at us constantly, and as we gather it, it forms the foundation for our plan of action, which is what the roadmap really is.\n2. Establish Objectives\nOnce we have collected our inputs, we need to parse the information into clear objectives. Objectives may be set for the company itself, for the department that we’re working in, for the specific product that we’re involved with, or even the specific feature that we own as part of that product team.\nObjectives are broad, ambitious goals that can inform meaningful discussions about what kinds of projects or releases might actually realize those goals.\n3. Determine Outcomes\nA core tenet of Agile is “outcomes over outputs.” The objectives we establish are only as good as the impact we expect them to make (to our customers, to our business, to our future). Determining outcomes helps us set and prioritize the right objectives.\n4. Measuring Outcomes / Iterating\nAs (and after) we execute our planned roadmap activities, we should be measuring the actual outcomes of our work. Those results become new inputs to inform the process. This is the cyclical nature of roadmapping.\nDownload Product Roadmaps: Planning Your Strategy➜\nRoadmap Iteration Frequency\nDifferent organizations iterate on their product roadmap at different intervals. Some teams might update their roadmap quarterly or every couple of weeks. Early-stage startups experimenting their way to product-market fit typically don’t even roadmap beyond six months into the future.\nBy contrast, enterprise organizations and hard product manufacturers may be working with five or seven-year-long roadmaps.\nWhatever the frequency, however adaptive the team, the contents of a roadmap are highly subject to change, but the process remains relatively constant.\nVision\nBefore you can establish objectives, you have to have a vision. It’s altogether possible, depending on where you are in your own product lifecycle or at what point you joined the current team that you’re working on, that you may be inheriting a product vision that’s already been established by the company, or it may be incumbent upon you and your team to help reinvigorate that vision.\nIf you’re a founder or product manager in a new startup, you may very well be part of the team that’s trying to establish the product vision.\nThe product vision is like an umbrella that spans over the top of the entire roadmap. It’s the ultimate state of being we are perpetually working toward.\nThere are a few really great techniques you can try for determining your product vision:\nPress Release Format\nElevator Pitch\nVision-Box\nMagazine Review\nThese exercises may seem corny to some, but envisioning is a necessary process for going beyond granularities toward big-picture thinking.\nAt 100 Product Managers, the vision is to become the most beloved place to gather product managers in community and conversation. Today, we’re articles, and we’re podcasts, and we’re free tools, and we’re resources, but the vision that stretches out over our entire roadmap is to create a robust community of highly engaged individuals sharing ideas and supporting each other.\nDownload Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\nAnnual or Quarterly Themes\nMonths and years are the temporal increments that help you realize your vision by tackling it in smaller bits. We call these smaller bits, themes.\nEstablishing themes is a powerful way to get entire teams or departments sharing the vision. And for that exact reason, themes should generally be succinct and actionable so that people can get excited, not confused. I like to think of themes as locker room cheers. Short sentences that end with exclamation points and result in teams charging the field.\nIn his book, Mastering the Rockefeller Habits, Verne Harnish sets up a really simple framework for both establishing and limiting roadmap themes. He suggests that for any given period you should have one internal and one external focus, and not more.\nObviously these rules can change depending on the scale of the organization, but in general, the practice of limiting themes is important for promoting focus.\nExternal themes drive outbound efforts. Some examples are “get funding!” or “keep employees!” or “drive referrals!”\nInternal themes drive operational behaviors. Some examples are “better production!” or, perhaps, “cheaper production!” or “improved process!”\nWhereas the product vision is highly unlikely to change from year to year, or even at all (if it’s big enough), themes should change annually and quarterly. Themes create the bedrock of your roadmap.\nMapping Projects to Themes\nOnce you have determined the annual and quarterly themes, you can begin to map your planned releases, projects, or initiatives to those themes, or brainstorm new ideas out of those themes.\nMapping your initiatives will help you better identify those projects which are just simply out of focus. However, most organizations don’t suffer from too few planned initiatives. If your initiatives are starting to pile up, this is a good opportunity to leverage a prioritization framework such as 2×2 grids or weighted scoring to further eliminate low impact ideas.\nIn my opinion, it doesn’t really matter what framework you use for prioritization, so long as you use a framework. What I’ve discovered in working with teams, is that nothing deflates morale more than a seemingly arbitrary process of prioritization, which doesn’t typically foster good team relations.\nDownload Prioritize Your Roadmap  ➜\nSo pick an approach, establish and agree to it with your team, and release the low priority ideas from purview. Now is the time to execute!\nBacklogs are not Roadmaps\nSome organizations refer to their product or opportunity backlogs as their product roadmap.\nA backlog or a list of feature ideas inform roadmap planning, but should not be confused with a true product roadmap. Bottom-up tactics don’t typically lead to a coherent upfront strategy.\nIf you’re using great tools like ProductPlan for your road mapping and Pivotal Tracker for your software delivery process, you can integrate them together and easily “telescope” (a term that I like to borrow from Amazon’s Jason Meresman, which describes the act of switching focus between present and future) between your backlog and roadmap while keeping progress in sync on both sides.\nMeasuring Outcomes Using OKRs\nThemes and initiatives give direction and priority to our roadmap but generally fall short in providing quantitative or qualitative measurements for assessing outcomes.\nThis is where the OKR framework can help. OKR stands for Objectives + Key Results. OKR is a syntax for goal setting that anchors broad, ambitious goals (objectives) to specific measurable outcomes (key results).\nHere is some example OKRs:\nObjective: Widen the appeal of the product!\nKey Result: Increase new registrations by 10%\nObjective: Create a best-in-class experience for our vendor partners!\nKey Result: 50% adoption rate for online vendor orders\nObjective: Become a better product manager!\nKey Result: Attend 3 product management workshops in Q4\nThe idea behind OKRs is to define a way for the team to understand (and share in the understanding of) where the finish line is. OKRs tell us how we will know when we have accomplished our objective and when it’s time to set new targets.\nIf you’re keen to learn more about the concept, I can’t recommend a better book for understanding OKRs than Christina Wodtke’s Radical Focus.\nBest Practices for Documenting and Sharing Your Product Roadmap Guide\nSo you have a roadmap, you’ve defined your OKRs, and you’ve established a shared understanding. There’s one more piece that you need, and that’s actually sharing the information with others.\nIn fact, one of the biggest reasons roadmaps fail is because most people in the organization never get to see them.\nGood roadmaps:\nAre easily shareable\nAre easily refactored\nProvide transparency\nRemove obstacles to change (which is inevitable when roadmapping) and embrace tools that make your roadmap easy to share, update, and access.\nTimelines\nKeep your timelines high-level. The roadmap is usually the worst possible place to make specific commitments like, “Yes, go ahead and put in that media buy,” or “Yes, go ahead and take out that loan,” or “Yes, go ahead and hire that whole new developer team.”\nBecause when we’re roadmapping, we’re in the widest part of the cone of uncertainty—usually out in front of project details by several weeks or even by several months. For that reason, we want to keep projects and timelines high-level and conservative across larger slots of time.\nIn fact, some organizations remove specific timelines altogether in favor of the Kanban approach, which really means, “We’re working on what we’re working on until it’s finished, and then (and only then) will we work on whatever is next.”\nRegardless of format, resist the temptation to use roadmaps for providing absolute deliverables, and instead use them to communicate the direction.\nWhy Do We Assemble a Roadmap?\nSo what are some uses for a product roadmap?\nShare the product vision and tell the world where we’re headed.\nIdentify possible resource gaps…in advance!\nCommunicate when certain features are going to be released. This is super helpful for sales and marketing teams that are busy trying to grow and maintain customer interest.\nDeclare End of Life plans. Google is notoriously bad at this. Microsoft is great at it. Be like Microsoft.\nIndicate when a new market segment is going to be addressed, for creating shared understanding amongst teams, and for getting buy-in from stakeholders.\nKeep outside partners informed.\nTakeaways\nRoadmaps start with inputs, which we collect from various sources. Then, inputs lead us to a series of annual and quarterly themes, which can inspire many epics or project initiatives. You should prioritize releases based on impact and made measurable using accountability frameworks like OKRs. If you’re new to product management or the process of roadmapping, you may discover that roadmapping is hard.\nRoadmapping is a highly strategic kind of exercise. It’s business-driven and necessarily holistic. If most of your experience to date has been in coordination roles, or you’re an associate product manager, or you’re new to the process, or you haven’t really been invited into the “war room,” a lot of you may struggle to try to put all these pieces together.\nThat’s ok.

The early proliferation of dazzling consumer experiences has bred a new generation of buyers who expect even their business software to look, work, and feel the same way as the other tools and experiences they’ve come to depend on and love. Good design is good business, and over the past 5 years or so startups and established companies alike have been scrambling. Hiring a UX designer is now more important than ever to stay competitive.\nThe problem for most companies is that, while we wouldn’t ask a product manager to hire an engineer or vice versa, these are often the groups tasked with hiring a UX designer to join the team. These groups, if being honest, may not truly understand how a UX designer will help them stay competitive, and commonly misinterpret design as simply applying a pleasing color palette or carefully selecting the right font. Businesses without an established design practice often lack the definition or understanding of design roles, leaving product development teams with a missed opportunity to incorporate design as a strategic differentiator.\nSo, if design isn’t about aesthetics and font, then what is it? In short, good design means your user doesn’t have to think. It means the system is easy to learn, remember, and delightfully exceeds their expectations in speed and reliability. It means that every next step is carefully anticipated, building a lasting emotional connection between the user and the system that is based on trust. Great design breeds loyalty in ways your users will struggle to articulate, expressing only the sentiment that “it just gets me.”\nTo hire successfully then, as with any position, it’s critical to focus on the outcome and not just the role. Understanding the breadth and complexity of what makes for “good design” will better position the non-designer to pinpoint the must-have qualities of a designer to join their team.\nDesign is a Practice, Not a Function\nThe first (and very common) mistake that businesses make in executing a strong design strategy is to focus on building the product first, with the goal of having a designer come in later to improve the user experience. But design is a practice in much the same way product management or engineering is. Having a designer come in at the end of a project to “polish” it is like hiring a product manager at the end to just work on market positioning for the product, or asking an engineer to “just hook up the back end”.\nIt’s an all too common story for talented UX designers to be turned off from a job interview when they realize that what the company actually wants is a graphic designer. This isn’t suggesting that graphic design is somehow unimportant — it is, in fact, a hugely important aspect of a strong design strategy — rather, it’s indicative of a blatant lack of knowledge of the UX designer’s field of expertise. The misconception of “UX designer” is understandable given that it’s sometimes a heated debate even in the design community, so it makes sense that non-designers would be doubly confused. But after hours of researching the business and crafting their resume and portfolio to demonstrate how their expertise can have an impact, it can still be insulting to realize that the business didn’t even attempt to understand the role for which they had advertised.\nThough opinions vary, there is consensus that “user experience design” is a general term that encompasses many specific disciplines. This was made famous by Dan Saffer’s Venn Diagram, The Disciplines of User Experience Design:\nTo simplify this and apply it to software and other digital products, think about a strong user experience design practice as one that embraces these five distinct disciplines: user research, information architecture, interaction design, visual design, and UI engineering. This illustration outlines each discipline accompanied by its various tools and deliverables.\nFor the non-designer, it’s not necessary to have an in-depth understanding of each UX discipline. But it is necessary to have some awareness of these disciplines to best inform what to look for when hiring to establish a design practice. The first designer or UX agency you hire on the team will be critical to this evolution, so it’s important to invest in someone whose expertise covers a wide gamut of these disciplines. And as the business grows, so should the design practice. Use the scale of UX disciplines to round out the talents of a growing UX team to ensure the right emphasis in the areas that will help great design be a strategic differentiator for your business.\n5 Qualities to Look for When Hiring a UX Designer:\nTo ignite a strong design strategy for your business, your first design hire should be able partner with you to own and execute that strategy. Assuming you only have budget for one designer, then it’s also important that this person has the experience and portfolio that demonstrates their strengths as an individual contributor. Following are five qualities of a designer who can make an immediate impact as well as nurture the growth of a solid design practice for your business.\nGlutton for Empathy\nAny designer’s core skill is their ability to empathize with users so they can anticipate their expected interactions with the product. But great designers understand that, while their work focuses primarily on the end user as the consumer, engineers and product managers are also consumers of their user insights. So, designers’ ability to empathize and distill information into meaningful and relatable stories extends beyond the interface design all the way down to building relationships and trust within the teams they are supporting.\nBusiness and Strategic Thinker\nIn some ways, your first designer should be indistinguishable from a product manager in the way they approach problem discovery. A good design leader understands how to prioritize user needs with business goals and can balance the natural tension between the business, technology, and the user. Oftentimes the role of balancing user vs. business needs falls on the shoulders of the product manager, and in a tough spot it’s usually the business that wins. But a great designer is eager to forge a partnership with their product manager and engineering leads, freeing each other up to lean on their individual biases to allow healthy debate and more rounded decision-making.\nTeacher and Facilitator\nDesigners want to be respected for their unique craft, but great design leaders refuse to hoard their design skills and won’t be protective or territorial about the process or their design team. Great UX designers are eager to teach and share in their craft, and they will often do this through the evangelism of design thinking. In practice, you’ll know you have a great designer in place when they are facilitating design workshops with engineers, or if they simply roll a whiteboard up to their team and hand the marker to an engineer and ask him or her to sketch an idea.\nTo learn more about tools experts use in product design teams, watch this recent webinar:\nStrong User Researcher\nIt’s not uncommon for designers to be a little rough around the edges when it comes to user research. Some designers, while they can design a beautiful screen layout, struggle to design structured research such as feedback loops, surveys, and usability tests without being influenced by their own bias to the design. A strong design leader can separate their ego from the raw user feedback because they are more driven by getting it right for the customer than receiving personal validation on their designs. They also put their facilitation skills to work in their research by making it a collaborative effort and inviting engineering and product management to learn through observation of usability tests and participation in qualitative interviews.\nStudent of Agile/Lean UX\nThe toughest spot a designer may find themselves in is as a bottleneck to their team’s ability to make fast decisions and move forward quickly. A designer’s empathic connection to the customer innately causes a sort of fear of lasting negative first impressions about a product or feature that is still a work-in-progress. This fear can be hugely detrimental to the team if their work isn’t being constantly validated with end users. But the fear can be hugely beneficial if leveraged to help teams think strategically about how to collect feedback and iterate in a way that will create lasting positive first impressions from customers. It’s important that the first designer you hire has the experience to put their fear in check and use it to encourage thoughtful iterations and smart rollout plans to achieve the desired results.\nDownload How Agile Product Managers Can Build Better Products ➜\nA Lasting Design Strategy\nA strong design strategy begins with an understanding of the impact and outcome of great design, and puts the right talent in place in order to reach that outcome. To achieve this, the non-designer must first be humble enough to admit that they might not fully understand value and role of a designer, then be diligent in learning more about the craft for which they’ve been charged with hiring for. By investing in hiring a UX designer with an acumen for business, this first hire can act as a partner to establish a healthy design practice for the long term.\nThe role of design transcends what looks good and builds and emotional connection to the end user because it also feels good to use the product. A business’ ability to leverage design to tap into the latent needs of its users is what will drives loyalty, and leaves competitors scratching their heads.\nJ.J. Kercher shares more of her product and design leadership thoughts in Spotlights: J.J.

I am deeply familiar with their common refrains of endless roadmap review meetings, repetitive PowerPoint presentations, and the strain of constant context shifting.\nSometimes, it’s helpful to get out of the day-to-day and see things from a different lens.\nI loved that stepping into ProductWorld’s Developer Week 2024 in San Francisco a few weeks ago reminded me of the other side of the product development experience. Engineers and development teams surrounded us—the people who collaborate with product teams daily—the often unsung heroes of building truly impactful products that solve real problems for real people.\nIt was a terrific experience hearing from my peers, mingling with fresh faces, and participating in great conversations about nurturing the coexistence of product and engineering with empathy, respect, and mutual accountability.\nI came out of Developer Week with three key takeaways about how we can work together in their quests to design, build, test, and ultimately ship great products. Keep reading to learn more about my experience at the event!\n#1 – The best product and engineering teams create shared accountability\nCollaboration is the cornerstone of successful product and engineering teams, starting with effective communication. By working together and being transparent, product and engineering will see each other as partners seeking to achieve the same goals.\nProduct teams are responsible for creating a strategy and explaining the “why” behind the product. Their importance shouldn’t be overlooked or dismissed as not technical enough. Product’s role is crucial to the development of effective product strategy and stakeholder buy-in.\nOn the other hand, engineering must stay informed throughout the product development lifecycle and closely involved in problem-solving processes. They should not be dismissed as “ticket-takers” and can provide insightful guidance to the product.\nSpeakers and attendees alike emphasized the importance of utilizing robust communication tools, like our product management platform, to facilitate seamless collaboration and encourage shared accountability.\nA collaborative mindset enhances teamwork and amplifies the overall impact of the product organization. In short, product teams should own outcomes while developers own the outputs. Together, they own the impact.\n#2 – Successful execution requires a thoughtful strategy\nProduct management and project management are often confused with one another, but they are two distinct roles that serve different purposes. Project managers should work closely with product teams to create thoughtful and realistic plans, similar to how engineering teams rely on product expertise for strategy. Successful product execution requires a thoughtful balance between ambition and probabilistic planning from product and project managers.\nJustin Meyer, CEO of Bitovi, shared valuable insights and practical strategies during his presentation “Building and Maintaining Actionable Multi-team Plans.” At Bitovi, they help product teams strengthen confidence in their estimates by taking a data-driven approach to planning. They build formulas with standard deviations around confidence in effort estimates to ensure realistic forecasts. This approach helps stakeholders identify critical paths and dependencies and promotes communication and shared accountability for the teams that are working together.\nProduct should also be prepared with thoughtful problem statements and have clear recommendations for an effective sequence of tasks. Each step is interdependent, underscoring the importance of creating mutual buy-in early in the product development lifecycle. To manage effective sequencing, Meyer suggested reducing scope, adjusting resources, and addressing confidence issues promptly.\nThe overarching goal of probabilistic planning is to expedite tasks with heightened confidence. All things considered, Product has a crucial role in the planning process. When alignment on the “what” and “why” is established, uncertainty about the “how” becomes secondary, fostering a conducive environment for successful execution.\n#3 – Expect the unexpected and learn to adapt\nIn an era of rapid technological advancements, it’s not just about having great ideas but mastering the art of embracing change and adapting swiftly to unforeseen challenges. Learning to pivot is not just a skill but a survival necessity. The conference drove home the importance of acknowledging this reality early on, urging product leaders to embrace agility to succeed.\nAlthough some things are out of your control, even the most minor expected setbacks can become opportunities for success.\nLindsay Harman, Senior Product Manager at Sirius XM, elaborated on ways to pivot and innovate in her presentation “Making the Most of Failed Products: Pivoting Your Roadmap and Goals When Things Don’t Go as Planned.” In one exercise, she had the audience imagine that they worked at a medical device company that recently released a wearable product to improve memory. But after going to market and finding early success, the FDA shuts them down for a side effect that increases the length of customers’ limbs… how should they pivot when confronted with this unforeseen obstacle?\nThis creative thinking exercise encouraged everyone to consider a new market. Is the “limb-lengthening” side effect desirable for some people? Is there an opportunity to sell to them and consider a new market? Although it was just an example, it was a fun and playful way to show the importance of adopting a mindset that welcomes unexpected change and adapts to survive.\nHow I’m bringing these insights into my work as a product leader\nAfter attending the conference, I felt inspired by the valuable insights I could bring back to ProductPlan. The most important takeaway was that shared accountability is essential for collaborative success.\nFirstly, shared accountability emerges as the foundation for collective success, reminding us that effective communication is the bridge that connects teams. The importance of a thoughtful strategy resonates clearly, urging leaders to find the right balance between ambition and probabilistic planning. And, of course, embracing change ensures survival and becomes the catalyst for innovation, setting our product teams up to be resilient.\nTogether, these key learnings form a compass guiding us toward sustained success and excellence in the ever-evolving world of product leadership.\nWhere is ProductPlan heading next?\nProductPlan will also attend the Product-Led Summit hosted by the Product-Led Alliance in New York on March 20-21.

I distilled the advice a few months ago in my book The Essentialist Product Manager and have recently been giving talks and workshops on the topic.\nThis article tackles one of the areas that gets the most interest from product managers: how can they use an essentialist approach to create and communicate better product roadmaps?\nFirst, let’s recap what essentialism means. The concepts were popularized in the book Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown. According to his book, an “essentialist” lives by design, not by default.\nAn essentialist isn’t reactive but rather makes choices deliberately by separating the few most important things from the hundreds of other less-important things. To achieve this, an essentialist must say “No” a lot.\nAs a product professional for over 20 years, this philosophy resonates with me. And it’s resonated with other product managers too. We already know that it’s not about getting more things done; it’s about getting the right things done. To ensure you’re adding the right features and initiatives to your product roadmap, I’ve outlined several suggestions here.\nHow to Roadmap like an Essentialist\n1. Start with the product vision.\nTo begin, an essentialist has a clear vision for the direction of the product. This product vision describes the overarching long-term mission of your product. Vision statements are aspirational and communicate concisely where the product hopes to go and what it hopes to achieve in the long term.\nThis vision is a guide for you and a reminder to your stakeholders about the shared objective they’re trying to achieve with this product. Your vision statement should also answer the question of your product’s “why.”\nWhy are you creating this product in the first place, and what do you hope to accomplish? It’s your compass for where you’re going.\nFrom an essentialist perspective, a clear vision creates alignment. It helps you and your team take a top-down approach to decisions, address conflicting priorities, and determine what initiatives land on the product roadmap. From the vision, you can draw your goals and objectives.\n2. Think “Minimum Product.”\nA minimum product is the opposite of the “it’s all-important” mentality. I’ve written a lot about the minimum viable product (or the minimum sellable product) that provides customers value. If you’re a product manager or part of a startup, you’ve likely heard about the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) concept for getting products to market faster.\nBut please don’t confuse the term “minimum” with essentialism. In my opinion, product teams often misunderstand the concept of an MVP, and I’ve seen entrepreneurs and product teams misinterpret it with unfortunate results. Those that take the concept of “minimum” at face value run the risk of releasing a thin set of features that may get their product to market quickly yet deliver a poor customer experience and ultimately fail.\nSure, it’s certainly a way of reducing a product’s scope to get it into customers’ hands faster. But the MVP also must be a set of features that provides customer value and customer delight. You need enough customer value/delight that it stands out from alternative solutions. And enough amount that a customer is willing to pay for it (or use it).\nI believe that “perfect is the enemy of good”\nA great example of this mindset was when I was part of a team that launched GoToMeeting’s online meeting software. Our team concluded that we could get our MVP to market with half the features. Yet, that wasn’t enough to have a product that stood out from a vast field of online meeting competitors.\nThrough our customer discovery interviews, we learned that we could differentiate GoToMeeting with several innovative “features.” First, we made it the easiest-to-use product on the market. We also introduced what was at the time an innovative all-you-can-use monthly subscription model – something that disrupted the market.\nTo me, this is essentialist product management in action – focusing on what matters most to customers.\n3. Discover the most important things to build.\nYou might be asking yourself, “how do I choose the most important things to work on?” I believe that part of the answer is through customer discovery. Customer discovery is a way of engaging with your customers to find pain. And it’s this pain that leads you to the solutions that are the things that matter.\nPeople buy products to reduce pain or create a gain. Through customer discovery interviews, you can learn what it would mean to a customer if you solved that pain. Your goal is to uncover the value proposition of solving problems. A value proposition represents the value that the customer gets out of using your product. So a value proposition could mean: Saving money. Saving time. Making money. Lifestyle benefits or professional benefits such as looking good in front of your boss.\nThrough an ongoing customer discovery process, I’ve learned that the right things to build bubble up to the top of your priority list. While there may be a debate about exactly what to build, learning from your customers, their greatest pains will point you in the right direction.\nYou can read more about Customer Discovery in my book, Find ‘Product-Market Fit Faster: Lessons for Product Managers.’\n4. Prioritize what’s most important using a framework.\nPrioritizing is a key part of a product manager’s day: Prioritizing the product backlog, prioritizing the sprint backlog, stakeholder planning meeting, building a product roadmap, triaging bugs, and much more.\nIf you have non-essentialist habits, you’ll soon drown in all the decisions to make and things to prioritize.\nTo help, you can use various frameworks to evaluate what to work on – the methods abound, and the exact method you use is not as important as having some mental model for prioritizing what’s most important.\nThink value versus effort\nEssentialist product managers have a mental model for looking at features and opportunities. Typically this model is based on customer value and its relative complexity to implement. Based on our conversations with product managers, this is a common approach. Many product managers go through this assessment instinctively every day.\nThe matrix is simple: The initiatives with the highest value and the lowest effort will be the low-hanging fruit for your roadmap. These are the opportunities in the upper left part of the quadrant pictured above (High Value, Low Effort). As an essentialist, you’ll want to include many of these opportunities on your roadmap. The lower right opportunities (Low Value, High Effort) you will probably never work on, so don’t spend any effort debating these.\nBased on dozens of interviews with product managers, at ProductPlan we arrived at a quantitative model for our product’s prioritization model. The Planning Board is tied to the roadmap. It uses the value versus complexity model but layers in scoring to arrive at an objective result. This model, shown below, is a way of introducing a framework for decision-making into your prioritization.\nProductPlan Planning Board Prioritization Framework\nBy using a scoring method to rank your strategic initiatives and significant features, product managers can facilitate a more productive discussion about what to include on the product roadmap. While many inputs ultimately go into a product decision, a scoring model can help the team have an objective conversation.\n5. Invest in Customer Delight features.\nThe Kano model is one way to think like an essentialist about the features you add to your product roadmap. With the Kano model, product managers can look at potential features through the delight a feature provides customers versus the potential investment you make to improve the feature.\nIn this model, there are some basic features that your product simply needs to have for you to sell your product in the market. You need to have these “threshold” features, but continuing to invest in them won’t improve customer delight dramatically. Don’t spend much energy here.\nThere are some features (like performance) that give you a proportionate increase in customer satisfaction as you invest in them. You can continue to invest some energy and resources over time in this category.\nFinally, you want to invest in some excitement features that will yield a disproportionate increase in customer delight. If you don’t have these features, customers might not even miss them; but if you include them and continue to invest in them, you will create dramatic customer delight. This might be the one area to test and then support to achieve a significant result – the very definition of essentialism.\nDelight features can be small.\nDelighter features don’t need to be substantial. They can be small and perhaps user interface features that make a difference in the customer’s experience. These “small wins” are important for an essentialist product manager. They allow you and your team to celebrate progress and keep the team’s energy higher for the more significant, more long-term projects—your customers benefit, as well.\nIn the case of ProductPlan, one of our early delighters was our visual drag-and-drop interface for building a roadmap. We spent a lot of time and engineering resources, making that 2-second experience of dragging an item onto the roadmap into delight. Ultimately, we created delight through our overall ease-of-use to create, collaborate, and share a roadmap with a team in minutes.\nIf you cut features back to only the “must-haves,” you have a recipe for a weak product that doesn’t succeed. Like a non-essentialist, you would be scattering your energy in multiple places to achieve a limited result.\n6. Plan using “themes.”\nAn essentialist product manager plans what they work on based on high-level goals. This translates well into planning your roadmap, which should also be high-level and strategic.\nThis is why your first step when roadmapping is determining the most critical high-level objectives. By organizing your roadmap by themes, you’re guiding the decision process for your top priorities.\nThemes help you narrow down the options to a handful of areas you want to improve for your customers. Use them sparingly, and you’ll be able to make significant progress. If you have too many themes, too many goals, your energy will be scattered, and you will make less incremental progress that may not give your customers meaningful value.\nThemes are the higher-level objectives on the roadmap – and they should represent successful customer outcomes. For example, an e-commerce company’s theme might be “improve the shopping cart experience to speed up the checkout.” Themes help you stay on track with the bigger strategic picture for your product.\nRather than creating a list of arbitrary and disconnected features for your product, instead, focus on what your desired outcome is for customers – what is the goal you want them to achieve? By focusing on an outcome-driven roadmap using themes, you (and your team) have room to think about new possibilities, about different and possibly faster ways of achieving the goal.\n7. Use OKRs to focus your efforts.\nEssentialist-oriented product managers work with their teams to create Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for setting business goals and measurable outcomes. OKRs are often used for quarterly planning, so they are much shorter timeframes and more measurable than a product vision.\nThese measurable objectives keep employees and stakeholders on the same page. They’re not set in stone. The objectives are reevaluated and adjusted regularly to ensure organizational alignment. OKRs are ambitious direction setters, singularly focused on the company’s ideal destination.\nAt ProductPlan, we have themes that we drive towards during the year, and our management team reevaluates them every six months. From these themes, we set specific OKRs that we review and revise quarterly. The OKRs are cross-functional in that one or more teams implement them. Some are very product-focused, while others are not.\nOKRs serve several valuable purposes. First, they foster a discussion among stakeholders and help us arrive at an agreement about what’s important—this creates alignment. They also serve as inspiring goals for employees, keeping them excited. Helping them focus on what matters. And of course, the key results are measurable ways that the business or product is improving.\n8. Get executives in alignment with your roadmap.\nFinally, building consensus among executives can be one of the most challenging aspects of a product manager’s job. Part of the solution is to get upfront agreement around your organization’s strategic goals and be transparent about your prioritization process. It’s important to make sure all parties in your organization are on the same page.\nRoadmaps are a culmination of a lot of work, customer conversations, and experience. The most common mistake product managers make in the roadmapping process is assuming they know exactly what to build without building consensus. Of course, you are the customer expert, but leading with the assumption that you alone know the ideal priorities has consequences that might sabotage your well-intended roadmap.\nFlexibility\nHave informal discussions with executives and other stakeholders before the executive planning meeting. That way, you’ll present a roadmap with the right priorities and align those to its business goals. It will help you to have a seamless review and approval process.\nFlexibility is a friend of the essentialist product manager. If you must create a roadmap with delivery dates, try to keep broad timeframes such as quarterly. Things are always more complicated and take longer than you and your team think. It will help your cause if you educate executives over time to know that you can only estimate fuzzy delivery dates and that priorities will undoubtedly shift.\nPreparation\nAnother characteristic of an essentialist product manager is the preparation that goes into planning the roadmap. This preparation comes in many forms, such as reviewing prototypes and concepts with customers early, working with the team to groom features well ahead of the sprint, and well-organized stories ahead of sprint planning meetings. In contrast, a non-essentialist product manager will be working on these things at the last minute and will be hoping for the best.\n9. Use a visual roadmap.\nUsing a visual roadmap to connect the roadmap to the strategy behind it is helpful. It ties the roadmap initiatives to actual customer value, business goals, and meeting real needs. Executives have a lot on their plates and generally try to stay as high level as possible.\nDon’t be afraid to acknowledge that there are unknowns. Communicate your level of certainty for each initiative during the presentation. Of course, the further out you go, the less certain things are for everyone. You can mitigate this by creating roadmaps that don’t extend as far into the future. This focus and great communication is the hallmark of an essentialist product manager.\n \t\n","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/roadmapping-essentialist/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925720477,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Access a Better Way to Collaborate in ProductPlan","text":"\n Have your big-picture roadmap discussions in the roadmap itself\nUsers of ProductPlan’s roadmap app can always add comments to any bar or container in a roadmap. Users can click on an item in the roadmap and type a note or question into the comments field. The app even lets users add @mentions to their comments, to make sure the right stakeholders see them.\nBut what if you want to add comments or questions about the roadmap? How can you start those higher-level conversations about product strategy or other roadmap-level issues? What if your comment or concern doesn’t fit neatly into any of the roadmap’s bars or containers?\nWe discovered that many ProductPlan users were creating these comment threads outside of our app—often in email and Slack channels.\nFeature: Roadmap-Level Conversations\nProductPlan has a feature that allows your team to have roadmap-level discussions within your roadmap itself.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Strategy Workbook➜\nHow does the new feature work\nLook for the bell icon in the upper-right corner of the ProductPlan app? Clicking on it brings up our roadmap-level Comments menu. It lets you filter between Open Comments and Resolved Comments to view All Comments for the roadmap.\nNow, when someone on your team wants to ask about timelines or budgets or competitive info—not for a particular theme or epic, but for the roadmap itself—they can start that conversation right here.\nNote: You can even have these high-level conversations for an entire portfolio of products if you’re using ProductPlan’s Portfolio View to consolidate multiple roadmaps.\nWith our Roadmap-Level Conversation feature, your team can now:\nHold and document strategic discussions at the roadmap level (rather than the bar or container level).\nReview roadmaps asynchronously with your stakeholders.\nDiscuss and resolve issues between individual roadmap bars and containers.\nUpdate your team on the status of roadmap initiatives, identify blockers, request additions, and document changes—all within your roadmap interface.\nYou can also resolve comments at the roadmap level. This way, all stakeholders quickly ensure they’re participating in the latest conversation about the current roadmap.\nMake it easy for stakeholders to see what’s changed since they last viewed the roadmap\nOur app does a great job of tracking all changes to your roadmaps. But your stakeholders have limited time. They want to see those changes quickly without reading through a long list of details. \nHere’s how we took that customer feedback to make our app even better.\nWhat our customers wanted\nSonia works for a multibillion-dollar tech solution company, and her team uses ProductPlan for their product roadmaps. We’ve heard variations on her request from many customers. Here’s how she summarized the issue:\n“I want to see a view of what was planned and what actually happened. It’s not a question of what was completed or not, it’s a matter of understanding how our plans changed.”\nWe knew we could do better. So, we created the Visualize Roadmap Changes option.”\nFeature: Visualize Roadmap Changes\nHow it works\nWith this feature, you can simply click a button and visually display the differences between roadmap versions or the differences between the roadmap at any two points in time. As you can see from the screen above, clicking into the History section still allows you to display roadmap changes as a list. Those updates display on the right-hand side.\nBut now you can also toggle to a visual depiction of this information. As you can see in the main panel above, the app can now also display the changes to the bars and containers. For example:\nItems moved show both original and new placement, connected with lines and arrows, and are color-coded with red borders.\nGreen borders depict items added to the roadmap.\nStrikethroughs show items removed after the previous version.\nWith the app’s Visualize Changes feature, your team can:\nMake roadmap changes easy to grasp for stakeholders.\nQuickly and easily compare a roadmap between any two points in time.\nEliminate the need to manually recreate visual changes for executive and other stakeholder roadmap updates.\nVisually monitor your performance and progress over time. (For example, to determine if your team is moving an items’ deadline more often than you’d like.)\nTakeaway\nThese new features address two very different use cases in our app, but they have a common theme: improved roadmap collaboration. At ProductPlan, we are always looking for ways that our roadmap app can help your team communicate and collaborate more efficiently—so you can build great products. Try our Visualize Roadmap Changes and Roadmap-Level Conversations features, and let us know if they hit the mark with your team.\nGet Your Free Roadmap Template Guide ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/roadmap-level-conversation/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925725832,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Agile Roadmap Planning: How to Balance Long Term Uncertainty","text":"\n At ProductPlan, I frequently get questions about agile roadmap planning. How should you balance long-term strategic planning with short-term agility?\nThis was an especially hot topic on a recent webinar we hosted. I thought I’d elaborate on some of my answers in this post. Here are 3 questions on that topic I’d like to highlight.\n1. How do you balance agile uncertainty with roadmap planning at a growing small or medium-sized company?\nIt’s important for product managers to not make the mistake of thinking that because they have a roadmap, they’re not agile. Those two concepts actually work in tandem. You need an agile roadmap to set the strategic goals for your company, but you still have a lot of freedom to move things around within those goals.\nDownload How Agile Product Managers Can Build Better Products ➜\nThere are a couple of points that I’ll make around this:\nThe first is that you should be doing continuous customer discovery and customer interviews. You should always be engaging with customers in order to find the big problems worth solving. And when you match customer problems up with the strategic goals that you’ve set for your organization, it will point you in the right direction in terms of which features to build.\nIt’s important to remember that you’re not necessarily putting narrow features and tasks on the roadmap. Instead, you’re bubbling those up to make the roadmap very high-level.\nYou need to be looking at big themes that will help you move the needle in problem areas that your customers have. Think about the jobs your customers need to get done. Remember, your agile roadmap helps you communicate the strategy. When you keep your roadmap high-level, you maintain a lot of flexibility as a product manager to move features in and out of the backlog in order to accomplish your goals.\nThe second point I want to make is that you should be reprioritizing all the time. Reprioritize your backlog and your roadmap, especially in the long-term, because things change and different competitive pressures come up. Don’t lock in timelines that are too long, or your stakeholders will feel like you’re making commitments and they’ll expect you to deliver.\n[Free book] Backlog Refinement: How to Prioritize What Matters ➜\nI think those two points are really important — doing continuous customer discovery and constantly reprioritizing features. That way you can ensure your agile process is really working for you. You don’t want to find yourself in a position where you’re throwing features into the development queue that was decided on twelve months ago. Those features may or may not be the right things to do today.\nAnd there’s one more thing I want to touch on — this idea of using a Kanban-style roadmap. The Kanban methodology has become pretty popular because it lets you organize the roadmap into different buckets — planned, doing, done, etc. — without committing to specific deadlines.\nWith a Kanban roadmap, you can designate things that you might want to be doing in the future, but you’re not quite sure about yet. You can distinguish the things that are a little bit fuzzy from the things that you’ve already committed to for the short term.\nI think that in a small or mid-size organization, Kanban is a great way to avoid making the mistake of locking in an inflexible,12-month roadmap that may or may not end up being the right course of action. And, of course, it should also be mixed in with continuous customer discovery and reprioritization.\n2. How far out should you plan your roadmap? How do you properly set expectations with stakeholders that plans will change?\nI think it depends. The appropriate timeframe for your roadmap depends on the kind of organization you have, the type of product you have, and where your product is in its lifecycle. If it’s an early-stage product, your roadmap needs to be very short-term. You simply don’t have enough insight into what the right things to build are, so your roadmap needs to be very flexible.\nOn the other hand, if you have a product that is five or six years into its lifecycle, your planning horizon needs to be much longer. So, again, it really depends on product and company maturity, but at ProductPlan, the most common roadmap time horizon our customers use is about a year.\nMany organizations are moving to an agile planning approach, and that makes it less likely that the things you’re putting on your roadmap for six or nine months from now are solid — and that presents challenges for product managers.\nWe hear from a lot of product managers who feel that creating a one-year roadmap means setting unreasonable expectations among their stakeholders. And that’s really a caveat here — you have to communicate to your stakeholders that the roadmap will change.\nOne of the ways that you can do that is by bringing your roadmap up a level. Again, the roadmap should not be simply a list of features or a backlog. The roadmap should be tied to strategic themes. So rather than listing out specific features or tasks that need to be accomplished, roll those up into larger themes and communicate the roadmap at the theme level.\nA theme ties back to strategy. For example, if your product is an e-commerce product and you want to reduce the rate of shopping cart abandonment — i.e. you want to improve the number of customers who are actually making purchases — that could become a theme. Now, the exact features that you create in order to accomplish that goal, or that theme, may change.\nYou also may not really know the effort level behind the features you’re considering. As you get closer to building them and you estimate the stories, it will become more clear what that effort level is. Then you can make trade-off decisions about which items will best accomplish your goals.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nSo those are my recommendations — that you manage stakeholder expectations that the plan will change and that you bring the roadmap up a level. As a product manager, you have a lot of flexibility in what you can accomplish as long as you don’t get locked into building a specific feature set.\n3. How do you adjust when you have roadmaps for a racehorse but realize you’re actually riding a mule?\nI love that question! I think a lot of us have been there, and I think it’s just the nature of things.\nAs product managers, we know what the path is — we have the vision for the product. But sometimes things don’t move as quickly as we want them to. I think setting up those longer-term strategic goals is the right way to safeguard against unexpected bumps in the road.\nAnd there’s no quick fix here other than to just stay on the path. As long as the path fits in with those strategic goals, you’ll eventually get there. Having that long-term strategic perspective will make it easier to say, “Yes, we are going to do that, just not yet.”\nI also think that this is where the concept of an MVP comes into play. Not every feature is important, and a lot of the things that you have on your roadmap, especially if you thought them up in the conference room, may not be the right things to build in the first place.\nI’ve found that I can often satisfy customers and give them a lot of value by building only 50% of what I thought they needed to have — and I’m constantly surprised by that. If you’re solving one key problem for them, they’ll buy and they’ll be happy, even though you may not have given them everything that was on the initial roadmap.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/balance-agile-uncertainty-with-roadmap-planning/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925746408,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Aligning Sales and Product Teams on Your Roadmap","text":"\n One of the biggest challenges product managers face is working with diverse stakeholders and managing their conflicting priorities. You’re pulled in a hundred different directions, and often it’s the sales team applying pressure on your roadmap priorities.\nAt times it’s tempting to build what the latest big sales prospect asked for. And sometimes, to close the deal, it’s tempting to make promises on release dates or to mention features that are still a few months out on the roadmap.\nI’ll elaborate on some of the points I made during our recent webinar, and explain how product managers can better work with sales teams to ensure they don’t over-promise and under-deliver.\nWhat successful methods have you found to manage the sales team selling roadmap features before readiness?\nThe sales team understandably is looking for ways to close the deal. That’s how they’re compensated, and I think it’s important for product managers to recognize that.\nYou can set expectations with the sales department that plans will change and you can talk all you want about being agile. You can tell them that you’re not sure when the exact delivery dates for certain features will be. But the reality is that when you send the sales team a roadmap, many will consider it to be a commitment.\nThe last thing you want is for sales to be attaching a copy of that roadmap to a customer contract. One option to consider: creating a separate sales-oriented roadmap — one that doesn’t have dates and that is less granular. A sales-oriented roadmap could also limit the timeframe, showing just what you’ll be delivering in the short term — maybe three months out.\nIt’s important to involve sales leadership in the roadmap planning process. Not only does it get their important input, but it helps establish buy-in. You also have the opportunity to guide them on why certain features are important from a strategic perspective.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nHow do you keep sales and product teams on the same page?\nIt’s important for product managers to make sure that the sales team is targeting the same market that the product team has identified for the product. Product managers usually work with personas, and I think that’s a really important concept, but sales teams may not necessarily have a similar sales persona.\nFor example, let’s say you’re a B2B company and you’re targeting companies with 1,000 to 2,000 employees. Well, your sales team better be doing the same. You’re building a product that solves a problem for that market, but if your sales team is then approaching startups, there’s going to be a problem. A product/market mismatch. The sales team will inevitably be disappointed, and of course, the customer will inevitably be disappointed.\nYou need to make sure that there’s alignment between your target market and the market that your sales department is actually selling to. Everybody should be pulling for the same team.\nTweet This:\n“Make sure your target market matches the market your sales team is actually selling to.” \nAlso, I think it’s important to nicely remind your stakeholders that sales and revenue aren’t the only success metrics. The success of a product is based on a whole lot of other things. For example, customer satisfaction after a sale is critical. If your sales team is selling actively but you have a lot of customers churning, that’s not good. So it’s important to recognize that there are other metrics out there besides sales that are worth paying attention to.\nDownload Get Buy-In on Your Product Stack➜\nHow do you avoid getting distracted by high-paying clients?\nWhen a high-profile client comes in and asks for a feature, it means something else is not going to get built. If everything is equal, if one feature is added to the roadmap, another one moves out. And it’s easy to get distracted from your core roadmap when a large prospect says, “If you build this feature, we’ll buy.”\nCheck them against your strategic objectives — this is where having those clear objectives and goals mapped out with your team becomes really critical. You need to make sure your team is aligned on strategic goals because if you’re making these decisions by yourself, you’re going to have an even harder time weighing the risks and benefits.\nWhatever this big deal is that’s being dangled in front of you, the feature they’re requesting needs to be tied back to your product vision. If you’re doing a good job of that, then it should be fairly clear what the right answer is. Sometimes it’s tough but you just have to say no or not yet.\nHave other suggestions on how to better align sales and product teams? Share them in the comments below. \n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/aligning-sales-product-teams-roadmap/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925731534,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Aligning Your Roadmap Themes to the Customer Journey","text":"\n Much has been written over the last few years on the idea of the featureless roadmap, which challenges product teams to present their plans grounded more in strategic vision – or by themes – rather than a laundry list of specific features. ProductPlan alone has several articles on the subject that demonstrate the many virtues of this outcome-focused approach. It’s becoming more and more widely adopted by Product Management organizations across the globe.\nOne of the critical considerations in developing your theme framework is to ask what drives the need for this theme? There is a genuine risk that a well-meaning product manager might simply group and categorize the existing feature list as a means for determining the theme. However, the real goal of the themed roadmap is to let the desired outcomes define the features. So how do you zero in on the most meaningful outcomes from which to center your roadmap themes around?\nHow to Decide on Roadmap Themes that Produce Meaningful Outcomes\nI’ve seen several different approaches, including themes that align with high-level business goals (acquisition, growth, customer satisfaction, etc.) or more granular focus areas like the example in Jim Semick’s article of increasing satisfaction within a user persona group. There are pros and cons to each of these approaches. For example, the business goals approach is static over time, so the themes themselves stay consistent and maintain a pulse on the longer view. But the themes in and of themselves are a bit uninspiring and don’t do much to communicate customer value. In the more granular approach, the focus is more laser-sharp and centered on a specific customer outcome. However, this approach runs the risk of myopia and losing sight of new emergent opportunities that might outweigh the theme’s value.\nA compelling theme should be centered on the exchange of value between the business and the customer, and the above examples are hyper-focused on one or the other.\nDownload Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\nOne way to achieve this balance is to organize your roadmap themes by each phase of the customer journey. This customer journey approach provides a widely universal framework for both business and customer outcomes and promotes a constant, bird-eye perspective on the end-to-end customer experience.\nThe Customer Journey Framework\nThe customer journey chronicles every customer interaction and touchpoint with your business—from becoming aware that you exist to making a purchase decision, using, and then eventually renewing with your product or service. The journey is depicted in different phases, which are relatively universal (but might be customized by a business that has done the work to map their customers’ journey). Those phases include Become Aware, Evaluate and Buy, Set Up, Happily Use, Get Support, Add Services, and Renew.\nThe Benefits of Defining Product Themes by Customer Journey Phases\nBreaking down the customer’s end-to-end journey is a highly effective framework that enables an outside-in perspective and customer empathy as a means to drive value that is reciprocal to both customer and the business:\nJourney maps, then, are highly applicable to the goal of defining product roadmap themes since successful customer outcomes are at the heart of each phase. Besides the apparent value exchange, the customer journey is a universal perspective that transcends organizational silos. Each phase of the journey has pretty clear stakeholders, for example, generating awareness is usually assigned to the marketing team, and the customer success department usually owns the support experience. Focusing your themes on phases of the customer journey enables stronger partnerships between the product team and other functional groups because their goals become less disparate from the product strategy. It changes the conversation from other departments vying for a slot on the product roadmap to one that is much more strategic. Both groups can become collaboratively responsible for goal setting within the shared theme.\nAnother benefit of the journey-based roadmap themes is that it inherently promotes customer empathy. Everyone in the company who looks at your product roadmap can evaluate it, not from just a customer perspective, but a timeline-based customer perspective. The customer journey enables individuals and teams to consider the context of their work within the customer’s end-to-end experience. Leading with this genuine care, curiosity, and perspective of the customer can have profound cultural effects on a business. Customer-centered cultures foster a bottom-up drive for innovation based on the desire to solve customer problems creatively.\nProblems are fluid, and markets are changing rapidly, so the work of a product manager to effectively prioritize work is a constant challenge effectively. Choosing the right theme altitude is critical to keeping eyes and ears open for emerging opportunities outside of the current focus areas. I like using customer journey phases as themes because, while customer needs may fluctuate, their journey stages are static. Maintaining consistency and continuity in themes provides a clearly defined lens from which to scan the customers, trends, and competition.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nCustomer Journey Roadmap Themes in Practice\nLet’s look at some tangible examples of how each theme may be planned and presented from the perspective of a fictitious e-commerce platform company.\nPhase 1: Become aware\nProspects know our product exists, and it has a positive reputation.\nGenerating awareness includes all of the things your marketing department is doing to reach new prospective customers. In this example, the product and marketing teams establish a mission to grow the reputation of the business by addressing issues raised by contributors to software review sites and focusing on a specific feature and usability gaps common among the less-favorable reviews.\nCUSTOMER KPI: Reach\nBUSINESS KPI: Reach as a % of Total Addressable Market (TAM)\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTNER: Marketing\nPhase 2: Evaluate & buy\nMake it easy for prospects to choose and purchase our product.\nReducing friction between a prospect and their willingness to buy is a key concern for sales and product management teams. Having a theme dedicated to this experience drives constant focus in this crucial area, like in this example, where the goal is to reduce sales objections by adding the top payment options prospects are demanding.\nCUSTOMER KPI: Time to deal close\nBUSINESS KPI: Maps to sales booking goals\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTNER: Sales\nPhase 3: Set-up\nNew customers can take immediate advantage of our product.\nProduct onboarding encompasses all the activities a customer or user engages in to configure, learn, and start using a product. In this example, the teams at our e-commerce platform are working on ways to do just that by introducing two new, self-guided onboarding flows within the product.\nCUSTOMER KPI: Time to the first use of the critical feature\nBUSINESS KPI: Time to goal monthly recurring revenue (MRR)\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTNER: Customer Success and/or Onboarding Teams\nPhase 4: Happily use\nCustomers get so much value from using the product, and they love it!\nNaturally, the phase focused on product use is how much of mainstream product management is currently categorizing their work. Given the above examples, one can begin to ascertain the benefits of instead capturing work in terms of the different outcomes defined by the customer journey. Keeping the outcome of this theme narrowly focused on adding value makes it an excellent space for prioritizing feature requests of current customers, usability improvements, addressing technical debt, and, as in this example, improving product engagement of a specific feature set.\nCUSTOMER KPI: Transactional Net Promoter Score (tNPS), System Usability Score (SUS)\nBUSINESS KPI: Critical engagement metrics\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTNER: Product Development (Product, UX, & Engineering)\nPhase 5: Get support\nCustomers rarely need help, but when problems arise, they are quickly solved.\nThe support phase is focused on making support resources easily accessible, improving resolution speed, building out various support channels, and reducing the need for support in the first place. The product team can have a significant impact on this outcome by doing this, like implementing an in-product support experience or, as in the example below, dedicating focus to address the top product case drivers.\nCUSTOMER KPI: Transactional Net Promoter Score (tNPS), Time to case resolution\nBUSINESS KPI: Tracking against operational cost efficiencies\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTNER: Customer Support\nPhase 6: Add services\nCustomers are compelled to upgrade and subscribe to value-add services.\nThe heart of the add services phase is in upgrades, upselling, and the purchase of additional products and services, all tied to a business’s growth initiatives. This theme can capture things like improving the discoverability of value-add services, adding features to be repackaged as a new subscription tier, or, as in this example, building out new features or services that customers would be willing to pay extra for.\nCUSTOMER KPI: Reach/Conversion\nBUSINESS KPI: Average Revenue per Unit (ARPU)\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTNER: Customer Success and/or Sales\nPhase 7: Renew\nCustomers remain loyal advocates of our product and business.\nThe renew phase looks at every opportunity to keep customers happy coming back to your product or service. Almost all SaaS businesses are looking at churn, and addressing those reasons is perhaps the most apparent epic under this theme. But, similar to some of the other themes, there may be opportunities to reduce effort by integrating account management experiences within the product, such as this example that would introduce a renewal flow and add the ability for SaaS customers to pay their invoice online (instead of sending a check).\nCUSTOMER KPI: Net Promoter Score, Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores\nBUSINESS KPI: Churn\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTNER: Customer Success\nConsiderations for Journey-Focused Roadmap Themes\nA highlighted benefit of having high-level themes that align with phases of the customer journey is that the themes are universally applicable across every department of the business. Sharing goals across business functions create a substantial competitive advantage for consistently delivering high-value, end-to-end experiences. There are, however, some aspects of this approach to be mindful of, which include:\nAvoid creating silos by phase. People and tactics may be focused on a specific phase. However, Product and Design need to maintain their awareness of their work’s context within the end-to-end journey.\nPhases require prioritization. While I advocate for having the same consistent themes, I don’t believe that work needs always to be happening equally within each. Certain phases will have a greater need than others. It’s up to the product team to appropriately allocate focus where the greatest needs are.\nPhases often have embedded journeys of their own. This is especially true for the Add Services phase, where there is a complete cycle of awareness to renew to consider.\nKeeping customer outcomes at the heart of your roadmap, effectively mapping them to business outcomes, and sharing those outcomes across your organization is an excellent recipe for driving innovation and building reciprocal value between your customers and your business. The phases of the customer journey already have this value exchange baked-in. They can be a highly effective lens through which to view and prioritize the opportunities on your product roadmap.\nRead the Strategic Roadmap Planning Guide\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/roadmap-themes-customer-journey/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925738312,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"An Alive Strategy vs. Dead Strategy","text":"\n Product Strategy is Important\nOne of the most important roles of a product manager (PM) is setting the product strategy. The strategy, by way of a roadmap, is the document that drives team alignment. When a group of people adopts a strategy, it transforms the product strategy from just a piece of paper to something that drives team success. Informed teams, including product and everyone that affects product development—from engineers to executives, can deliver consistent results, essential to any organization that wants to grow from pure greenfield exploration into gaining product-market fit. \nWhen you are looking for consistent strategic results that you can sell to the business and the team around you, you’ll need to escape the trap of pure feature velocity (“building stuff”) and get to building the “right stuff” that makes an impact for customers and the business. Consistent strategic results are essential because as teams scale, wasting time and resources gets easier.\nConsistency is why the strategy must exist and live in the minds of those who need to operationalize it. That is when the strategy is truly alive when you can see it in action. But, unfortunately, most strategy is dead when it exists, but in name only. \nWhat makes a strategy alive or dead? Well, let’s start by making sure you have a strategy that works first. If you aren’t sure what that looks like, you can find our complete guide here.\nA Refresher of the Six Pillars of an Alive Product Strategy:\n1. A product must have a purpose.\nBuilding a product just for the sake of creating and maintaining something isn’t a strategy. Products should have a raison d‘être and exist for something beyond themselves. What drives the company? Why does the founder wake up in the morning? What about your product can the customer not live without? Take the time to communicate externally to find the locus of your product’s truth. Once you simplify that into something repeatable that a team can align around, you are most of the way there.\nThe alive product strategy has a clear, repeatable purpose. Dead strategy is muddled. \n2. Understand the customer’s needs and their evolution.\nOur customers are important, so it is critical that any product strategy we make also has to meet the customer where they are. But, more importantly, we can’t fall into the trap of “building a faster horse” instead of a car. Our customers don’t deal in features, and they deal in problems. Those problems evolve, and so must our strategy. \nAlive strategy evolves with the customer. Dead strategy is static.\n3. Understand your value chain and how it’s evolving.\nProducts don’t exist in a vacuum. Neither do its users. The product strategy must incorporate how it fits into the larger ecosystem, determining where it adds value and where friction points remain. As an ecosystem changes, the product’s role within it may also evolve. When determining strategy, you can find insight into how your product makes decisions—whether looking at your competitors or what systems your product builds on to work.\nAlive strategy engages with the ecosystem. Dead strategy engages with a point in time.\n4. Determine what change is likely to happen.\nAlthough strategic thinkers don’t possess psychic powers, they should cast an eye toward the future and anticipate likely disruptions to either limit or expand the product’s opportunities for growth and usage. Then, with a good strategy, you’ll see what chances the business is willing to take.\nAn alive strategy makes bets. Dead strategy “knows” the future.\n5. Define actions against those changes.\nWith a view on the horizon, what can your strategy do to mitigate disruption or seize opportunities? \nAlive strategy anticipates risks. Dead strategy hides them.\n6. Measure success and course correct.\nThere’s no way to know if a strategy is successful if no one’s keeping score. While the strategy itself shouldn’t be hitting specific metrics, tracking progress and KPIs illuminate progress and offer potential warning signs.\nAlive strategy iterates. Dead strategy always starts from scratch.\nStrategy Doesn’t Need to Just Exist\nSimply having a strategy isn’t enough, however. For example, if a tree falls in the woods and no one hears it, did it make a sound? \nUnfortunately, many teams that find themselves with a product strategy have to ask. “how does this matter to me?” and, as a result, lose interest. Strategy means nothing if it isn’t alive, in people’s hands, hearts, and heads applying to their work.\nSo, as we continue this article, let’s ask ourselves some questions. First, does any of this sound familiar to you? \nFeeling unsure of what to do, even though the strategy is there.\nHaving a ton of distractions, even though the strategy is there.\nOperating in the past, even though the strategy is there.\nThen your strategy might be dead.\nDon’t fear! There is an opportunity here. If you have a strategy, you’ve already done the first step, create a strategy! So, we need to turn it around, and on that note, it feels like a good time to talk about what we mean by “alive.” \nAn Alive Product Strategy\nYes, your strategy is living.\nIn fact, strategy is a muscle and an important one for teams to exercise. Much like the muscles in your body, they need nutrition, and for them to operate at their best, they need exercise.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nSo, what do we mean by that?\nWhen we mention nutrition, your strategy needs context. Think about point two, mentioned above\n“2. Understand customer needs and their evolution \nOur customers are important, so it is critical that any product strategy we make also has to meet the customer where they are. More importantly, we can’t fall into the trap of ‘building a faster horse’ instead of a car. Our customers don’t deal in features, and they deal in problems. Those problems evolve, and so must our strategy. \nAlive strategy evolves with the customer. Dead strategy is static.”\nWhen you think about your customers, this concept makes sense. Our strategy needs to build towards our customers’ context of the marketplace. What if I told you that it needs also to do so internally – stakeholders who use your strategy also need that context. \nSo how is that strategy you made a few weeks ago? Is it alive? Does it have its nutrients? Has it gotten its exercise? In fact, when is the last time anyone referenced it? \nLet’s talk about alive in another way – author Robert Greene once told author Ryan Holiday this:\n“He told me there are two types of time: alive time and dead time. One is when you sit around when you wait until things happen to you. The other is when you are in control when you make every second count when you are learning and improving and growing.”\n“Strategy is something that grows” is great as a mental model to see product strategy. But, remember, product strategy is a muscle. When a team sits around and doesn’t exercise that muscle, it will atrophy. An atrophied strategy is a recipe for disaster, as it is as good as no strategy at all. In fact, an atrophied strategy is a one-step towards a dead strategy.\nSo, let’s pose the question again, is your strategy alive? Like any new artifact, your strategy, once well crafted, starts that way. That said, from a distance, an alive product strategy can look like a dead one if you don’t know what to look for.\nDon’t let your strategy turn into a zombie.\nA Dead Product Strategy Will Become A Zombie\nGrrr, brains\nZombies are scary (and possibly real). But we aren’t talking about those zombies right now. So instead, what we’re looking at is a zombie strategy.\nThe people we work with are smart and ready to work. A dead strategy, however, will sap their energy and leave our teams to fend for themselves. Moreover, as our teams grow, a culture built on dead strategy is a culture whose problems compound. \nProduct strategy is our domain, not theirs. When strategy atrophies, they will spend time working on things that make sense to them. Sometimes, the team will get lucky. Oftentimes, they will end up distracted.\nThat distraction is how you look up in the middle of the third quarter and wonder what happened to that roadmap you set in December. But, unfortunately, you’ve been bit by the strategy zombie, and as a result, the team is now playing catch up.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Strategy Workbook➜\nThe bad news, as a PM, is you’ve turned into a necromancer. The good news is that you can step away from that. The first step, though, is to identify if there is a dead strategy in your midst.\nHow do you identify a zombie strategy? Well, if it’s well built, here are a few indicators. Of course, we won’t leave you without homework either, so expect some ways to clear the zombies out. Then, each section holds a way to move that strategy from dead to alive.\n3 Ways to Identify a Dead Product Strategy\n1. Team members can’t remember what’s important.\nOur brains’ short-term memory holds 5-7 things at a time. Why is that important?\nOne of the issues that can zombify a product strategy is overloading people with too much information. \nWe may have an urge to load the strategy with everything we need to get done. You, as a PM, may feel like you are giving proper context – however, overloading the team with context is exactly what will atrophy your strategy. Instead of giving context and helping folks find alignment, you allow the team to turn off and figure it out independently. This is how your strategy sits on the shelf and eventually zombifies.\nSo, let’s make this real. \nLet me ask a question: \nIf you were to go around your team and ask, “What are the three priorities from our product strategy?” How confident are you that individual team members can list these top priorities? What about within 80% of your expectation?\nIf you gulped during that question, chances are, you may have a zombie product strategy on your hands. Unfortunately, whatever you thought was happening isn’t. The zombie strategy is eating your team’s mental space.\nGet the Practices and Processes for Effective Product Teams Checklist➜\nIn fact, brain science provides a reason for that. Our brains are more tuned to negative experiences than positive ones, up to seven times more. So those near-death experiences are negative experiences. \nStrategy is a positive one.\nSimplify your strategy \nThe basis of strategy is here. You need to simplify. \nEvangelize. Become a broken record and talk about the strategy regularly. Remind people at the end of every team meeting of the important pillars of your strategy. When people start getting sick of hearing it, you’ve only begun.\nPrioritize. Be clear about what is important, and get rid of the rest. Cut until it hurts – a strategy that doesn’t make any choices will atrophy.\nPositivize. Remind people of the small wins regularly. Remember, teams think negative first, so overwhelm them with positivity. \n2. Strategy incorporates incentives for all\nEvery discipline has its own incentives. It’s important to recognize that the strategy isn’t about you. Human beings are storytellers, and without something more compelling, they will take what is around them to create their incentives. That is why a telltale sign of a lack of an alive product strategy looks like this:\nEngineering cares about engineering stuff, same with design, marketing, and sales. \nIt’s natural with any vocation. Teams are just telling themselves a story and running with it. Since it isn’t compelling, they have to make it up as they go along. \nA strategy will atrophy if the members of the team don’t see themselves in the strategy. As a PM, are you aware of everyone’s incentive? If you have to wonder, chances are you don’t. \nWhen building the strategy, remember strategy is an abstraction. That abstraction helps people fit their mental model into the world itself. If that strategy doesn’t help them, they’ll split their time between your strategy and their incentive at best, and at worst, completely ignore your strategy. \nThen your strategy is dead. \nAs an owner of the product strategy, make sure you talk to the point of contact from every discipline. Meet with the team regularly and have coffee with random team members to find out what drives those team members to work.\nThis is a slower process, but every time you iterate, the strategy gets better. This is because you are working your strategy muscles with each conversation as you make it more alive.  As a bonus, your relationship with the other discipline will get better, too.\n3. Strategy relies on consistent process\nDo not try to turn the entire ship at once. Our teams have enough on their plate. That is why we, as PMs, have to be very careful when we bring in a new process.\nIf we do, we have to do so thoughtfully and repeatedly. Once is not enough. Remember, our brains can only hold 3-7 things in short-term memory, so it’s far better to leverage things that are already comfortable in an organization or build it into muscle memory.\nAs PMs, we live with our strategies for a long time, making sense to us (only). So we want to try a new process to shake things up and partially bring newness to ourselves, selfishly. So, we make the team go through an exercise, something you may find on the internet, and never refer to it again since the pieces fit so well in your head.\nWell, while you may remember it, the team around you has their own issues, and more than likely, is overloaded.\nWhen this happens, you’ve walked right into a dead strategy since the team has learned not to take anything you’ve done as seriously.\nAs a rule of thumb, small edits to the current process are better than a new process. If you aren’t going to plan around a new process to ensure it’s compelling and do it often, don’t do it at all.\nAlive Product Strategy Starts with You\nThere is a pattern here. A product strategy isn’t alive on its own. So simply writing a great one isn’t good enough. Instead, as a PM or product leader, you’ll need to work hard at keeping it alive continuously.\nIt’s worth bringing up this quote again.\n“He told me there are two types of time: alive time and dead time. One is when you sit around when you wait until things happen to you. The other is when you are in control when you make every second count when you are learning and improving and growing.”\nOne is when you sit around when you wait until things happen to you. The other is when you are in control when you make every second count when you are learning and improving and growing.\nA great strategy is something you control, iterate, and grow. If you aren’t careful, you’ll turn from a PM into an unwitting necromancer. So your strategy will be less about control and more about waiting.\nStrategy is a way to speed up alignment, and alignment isn’t stationary. If you aren’t working those strategy muscles, your strategy will turn from alive to dead. As a result, your team will get further and further away when strategy stands still.\nBuilding a product strategy is not enough; make sure the strategy is alive and aligned not just with the market and the customers but also with the team that is working through it. When other functions use product strategy, it lessens the cross-functional burden and gives the organization a chance to course-correct when things aren’t going well. \nKeep your product strategy alive with focused goals, aligned incentives, and repeatable processes. \nDownload IMPACT ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/alive-product-strategy/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925709560,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Are you Solving Customer Problems or Just Building Features?","text":"\n When your product can do more than it could do before, that sounds like a good thing. Added functionality, new capabilities, a more robust feature set…these are the talking points product marketers salivate over and executives search for on product roadmaps. But are you solving for actual customer problems?\nIn the never-ending race to ship out product updates to keep up with—or ideally, stay ahead of—the competition, it’s easy to get caught up in the flurry of activity and become a feature factory. The danger, however, lies in mistaking new functionality for actually adding meaningful value to the customer experience.\nAll those new features might look good on a product comparison matrix and give salespeople a new angle when pitching reluctant prospects, but none of it matters if those features aren’t solving real customer problems.\nWhere are product teams getting their feature ideas?\nAccording to our 2023 State of Product Management Report, customer feature requests are still the top source of actionable product ideas, but that’s only the case for 35% of respondents. Feedback from sales and support is the source 26% of the time, and the competition inspires new features for 16% of respondents. Most concerningly, 19% of respondents reported that their top source of ideas comes from senior management, who are often disconnected from both customers and the product development process.\nTo reframe things, only about one out of three feature ideas actually come directly from customers… you know, the people who are paying money to use your products. And while a quarter comes from sales and support, these too can come with their own caveats since there’s always some amount of interpretation and bias involved.\nWhen product investments don’t meet expectations, the blame gets spread around. But a lack of a clear company strategy (23%), poor prioritization (19%), misallocation of resources (17%), and underdeveloped roadmaps (17%) encompass the vast majority of misfires. These all point to internal deficiencies in planning rather than problematic execution. In short, organizations are making the wrong bets rather than messing up on the go-to-market or implementation fronts.\nWhy do product teams become feature factories?\nNo one intends to waste valuable resources on projects that don’t yield meaningful results. No software developer wakes up in the morning excited to write a bunch of code that will be re-written a few sprints later. Product managers don’t want to ship features no one will use. And no management team prefers an extra bullet point in a sales deck over another satisfied customer.\nBut despite good intentions, feature factories arise more often than anyone cares to admit. There’s no single cause for these misguided projects frittering away precious development and testing resources, but there are some common causes for many of these missteps.\nA scattershot strategy\nIn the quest to meet the needs of as many different people and customers as possible, product teams can become too ambitious and reactive in their strategic planning. Saying no to a key customer or stakeholder is challenging, so the product team finds itself pursuing multiple paths simultaneously.\nImplementation teams get divided up to solve lots of different types of problems, often in the same sprints. This can incrementally add new capabilities to the product and potentially quell a few customer complaints, but without a a unified vision, it can also lead to a lot of partial fixes that don’t attack and solve major pain points in a holistic manner.\nInstead of the product team putting more energy into validating and solving major problems, customers get a steady stream of tweaks and minor improvements across the board. This generates a sense of progress and improvement in the form of minor enhancements that may feel like you’re on the right path, but never quite puts those issues to bed from a customer perspective. It’s a bit like treading water. You might stay afloat, but you’re burning a lot of energy without getting closer to the shore.\nNoisy customers\nWhen it comes to your product roadmap, the customer is most definitely NOT always right, especially when they ask for specific features. This doesn’t mean customer ideas and requests should be ignored… quite the opposite! But it does mean product teams should ultimately be responsible for defining features.\nWhen a customer has a feature idea, it’s not really because they want that particular feature. In the majority of cases, they have a problem or pain point they want to address, and their suggested solution is their way of asking for help. But most of your customers probably aren’t product managers. They just want the problem to go away and this is their best guess on how to solve it.\nIf you build exactly what the customer asks for, it doesn’t guarantee they’ll get what they actually want. For products to truly address the root cause, product managers must understand the jobs their customers are trying to get done and identify the roadblocks preventing them from achieving it.\nWhile it’s certainly possible that the feature request is spot-on, chances are it doesn’t fully address the underlying issue or will only address a very narrow set of use cases that don’t necessarily fit in with your product vision.\nBy really digging into the problem space with customers and putting in the right validation efforts, the product team can get a clearer picture of the right solution opportunity. Then they can work with the implementation team to shape a more holistic solution that improves things for a broader swath of current and potential clients.\nShiny object syndrome\nWhen an executive with enough influence gets excited about something, their enthusiasm can sometimes create a runaway train. They could be inspired by new technology, a new business model gaining traction, or a competitor’s differentiating capabilities. Whatever it is, these power brokers get it in their heads that THIS is the game-changing addition the product needs. This comes regardless of any existing customer problems to be solved.\nThey bypass ROI calculations, due diligence, prioritization exercises, and customer validation. They lobby hard for their new obsession to jump the queue and get added to the product. Fearing blowback or simply trying to play nice with this executive, product managers just go with the flow and disrupt their own roadmap and strategic plans to make it happen.\nWhen it hits the market and doesn’t move any needles, there’s less scrutiny and criticism because who wants to tell the boss that their bad idea was a flop? And without some brave souls willing to take a stand, it’s likely to keep happening as long as that power dynamic continues.\nHow can product teams focus on value versus volume?\nTo ensure product development resources get expended on actual customer problems, product managers must dig deep into their toolbox. Relying on some of these fundamental principles will introduce more discipline into the process and give the product team solid footing to stand their ground and make some potentially unpopular decisions.\nLearn to say no\nNearly everything on a product roadmap is there because someone thought it was a great idea or asked for it. Unfortunately, there are way more great ideas and requests than there is time to address them. We can’t do everything, so we must be choosy.\nThis puts product managers in the awkward position of having to say “no” to stakeholders and customers. It’s awkward because plenty of us are people pleasers. Plus it seems odd to say we’re trying to satisfy customers while regularly telling them “we’re not going to give you what you are asking for.”\nProduct managers don’t do themselves any favors when they agree to do everything asked of them. It’s not possible to deliver on those promises and it’s an irresponsible use of resources to say “yes” to everything.\nProduct management would be a pretty easy job if all we had to do was take requests and hand them over to developers. Deciphering which requests will drive key results is the secret sauce. Luckily, saying no is a little easier when there’s an objective prioritization process guiding those decisions.\nUse prioritization frameworks\nEvery decision to build a new feature is a judgment call. But making the decision on any one feature in a vacuum presents problems. There’s no context nor much consideration given to what DOESN’T get built instead.\nUsing prioritization frameworks eliminates these isolated judgment calls. They force everyone involved to both justify the need for a given feature and stare at the trade-offs head-on. Consider selecting a framework that incorporates scoring and ROI. These are particularly helpful for avoiding prioritizing features that don’t move the needle in meaningful ways for customers or the business.\nThe opportunity scoring framework puts customers in the driver’s seat, which should lead to prioritizing features that customers actually care about. The jobs-to-be-done framework is another tool that refocuses prioritization around what customers are trying to do rather than what the product team thinks they need.\nThere are many prioritization frameworks to choose from, so teams should try out a few to find their best fit. You don’t have to pick the perfect framework. The most important thing is to use ANY of them (if not multiple frameworks). These are tools that can help force more objective conversations. Plus, they help you directly acknowledge the tough trade-off decisions that need to be made.\nValidate with multiple customers\nIt’s natural to want to make customers happy. We are in the “delight” business after all. But the problem facing a particular customer may or may not represent a true systemic need. It might be unique to that customer due to external factors or just not be a top priority for others.\nThe only way to fully comprehend the scope of the issue is to engage more customers. Discover whether this is a real problem for them as well. If it’s a common complaint causing customers a significant level of pain, then it likely warrants prioritization. Otherwise, there are likely better things to work on.\nSome enterprise clients may still get their personal wish list items fulfilled. But the organization should go into things with their eyes wide open regarding the eventual ROI and impact of dedicating resources to a relatively bespoke situation.\nDefine KPIs and success metrics upfront\nDon’t build something, release it, and then figure out how to gauge its success. Rather, product teams must begin by defining measurable indicators of the outcome they’re aiming for.\nIf the team can’t come up with any solid way of assessing the ROI or impact of a new feature, then it’s time to revisit the rationale altogether. No net-new features should make it onto the product roadmap without a measurable benefit for the business/customer base.\nAdopt a theme-based approach to roadmapping\nThe antithesis of scattershot feature releases is leveraging themes to dictate product development. Themes create an overarching thrust for an entire development cycle.\nThis enables the product team to prioritize multiple features to be worked on at once with the ultimate goal of building out significant functionality to comprehensively solve a specific problem area. Instead of making parts of the product slightly better, it takes one problem and tackles it head-on.\nThis singular focus yields benefits for the entire business. Product teams can do their homework and fully understand a problem, providing valuable customer insights to the organization. Implementation teams can dedicate more resources and problem-solving energy toward identifying comprehensive solutions. Sales and marketing have a meaty set of capabilities to sink their teeth into for go-to-market and customer communication purposes. And senior leadership can get out of the weeds and focus on big-picture priorities.\nKeeping customer problems at the forefront\nResisting the pressure to continually push new features instead of focusing on customer problems might give you a case of imposter syndrome. But rest assured you’re doing the right thing. Customers aren’t counting how many new bells and whistles your product adds. They just want it to do what they need it to do.\nSo use the strategies above to keep your product on track and your team focused on what really matters. To bolster yourself, here’s more on why you should put your customers first.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/solving-problems-or-building-features/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925718460,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Battling Roadmap Inconsistency","text":"\n If you’ve been in a product for a while, you’ve almost certainly run into the problem of inconsistent documentation. This problem rears its ugly head in lots of places:\nRequirements spread across product briefs, PRDs, Jira or other workflow management tool tickets, and wireframes\nWeb-based and in-app user guides\nSales collateral, especially in B2B situations in which sales execs like to put their spin on the pitch\nProduct roadmaps\nInconsistent documentation is, of course, only one example of a lack of standardization within a product team. This post will focus on the last example, product roadmaps. Furthermore, the post will offer some suggestions on how you can get this issue under control.\nWhy does roadmap inconsistency matter?\nWhat are the problems that arise from having inconsistent roadmaps, starting with the most consequential?\nYour story lacks coherence\nThe worst result of roadmap inconsistency is that the story doesn’t make sense. The details at the drill-down level don’t support the big-picture vision. This inconsistency is the most insidious sign of a poor product strategy. It has the consequence of individual teams failing to align. In either case, the outcome is the same – a failure (or at least an obstacle to overcome) to achieve your goals.\nYour audiences get the wrong message\nIf you only have one roadmap for the entire company that you show to everyone who needs to see it, inconsistency is not an issue for you. The effectiveness of communication might be, but that’s a different topic. Or you may work at a very small company. Smaller companies may not need to target views of their roadmap for different groups – internal/external, executives/product team/sales team, etc.\nIf you have reached that point, however, a set of roadmaps describe a different picture of the future. When it comes to expectation management, those different understandings make a big difference. One group may celebrate the evolution of the product, while the other experiences confusion.\nFor example, you could find yourself in a situation where the customer support team is thrilled about a fix. The fix addresses a big source of support tickets. However, the sales team is incensed that the valuable feature they have been promising customers is still in development. Or worse, depending on how large, decentralized, and empowered your product team is, you could have teams working on problems that have been deprioritized based on a change in corporate strategy.\nThe roadmap user experience makes the reader “work for it”\nIf your product team is of sufficient size to include multiple product managers, all with responsibility for a different aspect of the product, then you likely have multiple individuals creating and contributing to views of your roadmap at different levels. With each person applying their spin on how to visualize the plan for their area of responsibility, even if each team’s plan is aligned with the overall vision, you can end up with a document that is difficult to decipher. Inconsistency of formatting and what drill-down details to include can create an increased cognitive load on the reader or viewer that requires unwanted work to understand. At worst, these issues can make what is otherwise a well-aligned team and story come across as disconnected and disjointed.\nDownload the Product Planning Workbook➜\nTypes of inconsistency and how to fix them\nRoadmap inconsistency falls into three categories:\nStructure\nContent\nStyle\nYou need to address all three to avoid the issues we reviewed above.\nStructural inconsistency\nStructural consistency requires the product team to choose a standardized roadmap the collective can use. Will you adopt a feature-based roadmap or an outcome-driven roadmap? If you select an outcome-driven, feature-less roadmap approach, will you build your story around themes or a north star?\nThe second aspect of structural consistency to consider is the time horizon. Whereas traditional roadmaps orient around a calendar-based timeline, typically divided into quarters or even years in some cases, more and more teams are adopting a Now, Next, and Later approach. This type of structure, used primarily with outcome-driven roadmaps, acknowledges the uncertainty around strategic outcome achievement. Calendar-oriented timelines have more common with feature-based roadmaps, which usually aim to communicate specifics about when a new feature will be delivered.\nAnother element of structural consistency that can be overlooked is decisions about what to include in different roadmap views. For example, sometimes it’s appropriate to include an item on the view that the sales team shows to customers, and sometimes it’s not. Having a way to manage information disclosure can go a long way toward avoiding uncomfortable conversations when a customer gets excited about an early-stage idea on the roadmap that was ultimately deprioritized.\nTemplates and tags\nProductPlan helps product leaders manage structural roadmap consistency through templates and tags. There are a variety of template types that teams can use as-is or customize as needed. Or if none of the pre-existing templates are quite right, product leaders can create templates from scratch. In either case, product managers can save preferred templates for team members to use as they build the roadmap for their specific area of responsibility.\nProductPlan also allows for custom tags and a way to manage tags to avoid redundancy and error. Once in place, tags can filter roadmap items to create the right view for your audience and situation.\nInconsistent content\nWhen you have a team of product managers contributing individual areas to a larger roadmap owned by a Portfolio Product Manager, you run the risk that each person will make decisions about what information is important to include and what isn’t. The old saying, “The devil is in the details,” applies here. A consistent set of details for every item on the roadmap goes a long way toward instilling confidence in the decisions.\nFor example, at the most basic level, information like what you are building, why you are building it, and who you are building it for are a good start at establishing a common set of details for each item. In many cases, companies will want to go further to include information like the responsible product owner, the allocated budget, and the values assigned to each item that contributed to its prioritization.\nProductPlan has two features that are particularly helpful in maintaining consistent content in your roadmap. Custom fields give you a way to specify exactly what content you want product managers to include, assuring that when a stakeholder drills down, they get the same set of supporting details for each item. The Prioritization Board provides a customizable set of scoring criteria that allow your team to make objective decisions about the importance and anticipated value of each item on the roadmap. This objective prioritization helps you avoid the dreaded HiPPO approach to product strategy and communicate the “why” behind an item’s placement in the plan.\nStylistic inconsistency\nSometimes designs are objectively bad or at least worse than others when comparing the outcomes achieved by alternatives. The practice of A/B testing allows product teams to make design decisions out of subjective opinions about whether the orange or blue call-to-action button is better by looking at the conversion data achieved by each.\nOften, however, decisions about design alternatives are purely subjective. Should we use a serif or sans-serif font for labels? Will the items on the roadmap related to this theme be green or purple? Should we use a light orange or dark orange to denote initiatives that are at risk? Or should we use yellow? Product managers, left to their own devices, will make different decisions when creating their roadmap. Even if the rest of the content and structure of the roadmap is completely consistent, a stylistic hodge-podge is the first thing stakeholders will see, and the rest of the content will immediately be suspect.\nShared legends and templates\nWith Shared Legends and templates, ProductPlan users can easily maintain a consistent look and feel for their roadmaps. Shared Legends allows admins to create and lock down roadmap legends. Individual users will have to use predetermined colors and labels. Just as templates allow product leaders to implement structural consistency, they also support stylistic consistency. Templates provide a way for product leaders to provide an officially-styled display format that product managers can not change.\nWith ProductPlan’s roadmap software, product teams have a rich set of tools available to battle roadmap inconsistency. By ensuring that roadmaps are consistent structurally, in content, and stylistically, product leaders can better communicate the information, stakeholders need with a product roadmap.\nLearn how to transform your product launches from chaos to success➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/battling-roadmap-inconsistency/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925722174,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Best of ProductPlan 2022","text":"\n The past year was a lot, but dull wasn’t one of them. With so many social media posts, blogs, videos, ebooks, and podcasts, it’s hard to keep up. Look at how many browser tabs you have open right now for things you still want to read! To help you get over your FOMO on any amazing content from your friends at ProductPlan, we’ve pulled together the most-viewed articles, blogs, and glossary entries this past year. So, without further ado, here are the top ten pieces from ProductPlan for 2022!\n10. 10 Great Questions Product Managers Should Ask Customers\nKicking off our top ten is a top-ten list of its own! It’s a tenet of Product Management 101 that PMs need to get out of the building and talk to real-live customers… even if it’s just over Zoom.\nBut while fresh insights from actual users are always invaluable, you’ve only got so much time to pick their brains. To make the most of it, these ten questions maximize your opportunity to collect primary research by asking open-ended questions that coax real nuggets of insight from these interview sessions.\nBest of all, it means you’ll do more listening and less talking, which is always a good thing.\n9. Misfits, Geniuses, and Ringleaders: Why Product Management May Be Perfect for You\nThis guest post from LogMeIn Principal Product Manager Carey Caulfield helps readers understand if their entrepreneurial mindset and career aspirations are a good fit for product management.\nWeaving in a few anecdotes and experiences from her career, Caulfield forces readers to take a clear look inside themselves to determine if they have what it takes and whether it’s a job they actually want.\nThis primer on why product management may be perfect for you is a great read for those considering leaping to another career or for senior product leaders to share with colleagues outside the product team yearning to join.\nDownload How to Structure Your Product Management Organization for Success➜\n8. 4 Key Responsibilities of Outstanding Product Managers\nWhether you’re writing a job description for a future hire, preparing for your first day at a new position, or simply investigating whether product management sounds like a good gig, you need a solid understanding of what the job entails. But beyond the obvious bullet points, such as “maintaining a product roadmap” and “understanding customer and market needs,” our VP of Product Annie Dunham says she’s looking for PMs to go above and beyond in certain areas.\nAnnie’s top four integrate some of the key soft skills product managers need to build trust and operate transparently while still holding the line against any departures from the core product strategy. See what it takes to stand out in her organization.\n7. The Product Manager Career Path\nWith no direct pipeline from trade schools or a specific college major, all sorts of people end up in product management at different phases of their careers. But whether you’re a freshly-minted MBA, a converted project manager/customer service rep/engineer, a product management “lifer,” or still on the outside looking in, there’s always an on-ramp to the PM life and new tiers to reach within the discipline.\nOur guide to product management careers runs the gamut from entry-level roles to the C-suite, explaining the responsibilities of each position and some tips on how to level up within the field.\n6. Product Manager vs. Product Owner\nAlthough the “vs.” in this article’s title might think these roles are adversarial, PMs and POs can and should work together. But like any ensemble, they need to know their part and stay in harmony with the rest of the band.\nAt the highest level, it’s about one concentrating on strategic matters while the other focuses on tactical execution, but this article delves further into which skills each role demands and their inevitable overlap. It also touches on cases where the same individual may fill both roles in smaller organizations.\n5. 11 Revealing Product Manager Job Interview Questions\nAll the job switching and newly created product positions this past year meant a lot of product management leaders were busy trying to determine which candidates were a great fit for their teams. But getting a strong sense of an applicant’s skills, mindset, work ethic, and style is tricky when you can only have a short amount of time with them.\nTo help interviewers maximize their opportunity to find diamonds in the rough and kick the pretenders to the curb, we’ve got 11 tried-and-true questions that will reveal a little more about the candidates’ inner selves than their resumes put on display. From putting them on the spot to pitch you a product to having them define product management to ensure both parties are aligned on what this specific job entails, these go-to questions will give interviewers a fuller picture of the person sitting across the table…or on the other end of the video call.\n4. 4 Product Management Certifications that are Worth Your Time\nIn this crazy job market, everyone knows you need to stand out in the crowd and show potential employers you know your stuff. So it’s no surprise many current, and aspiring product management professionals were looking to burnish their credentials.\nThis list of 4 Product Management Certifications saves you the trouble of sifting through the many options on the market. We outline what we like about each program to help you narrow things down and accelerate your path to certified product management expertise.\n3. Acceptance Criteria\nAfter a meandering diversion through career-related content, our top three pieces return to the nitty-gritty details of product management work by defining a few key terms product managers were exceptionally curious about this year.\nAs Mick Jagger once told us, you can’t always get what you want, but… you get what you need. Acceptance criteria help stakeholders separate “want” from “need” by stating the minimum necessary to move forward.\nAlignment around this “definition of done” is essential in the fast-paced world of Agile development since engineers are given more leeway in the specifics of each implementation. Clearly, articulated acceptance criteria list precisely what must be present before product development even thinks about testing and shipping a new release while informing the test plan for quality assurance.\n2. MoSCoW Prioritization Model\nThis rollercoaster of capitalization nabbed second place… hopefully not just because people wanted to know what that wild acronym stands for! More likely, readers remain intrigued by the particular pros and cons of this technique for deciding what to build next.\nThe MoSCoW Prioritization Model is a fitting follow-up to acceptance criteria as it slots potential functionality into four definitive tiers:\nMust-have\nShould-have\nCan-have\nWon’t-have\nWhen the team is aligned around which bucket each feature or capability falls into, there’s no mystery surrounding what to work on first, what might sneak in, and what belongs on the back burner for now.\n1. RICE Scoring Model\nTopping the charts this year was another prioritization method, the RICE scoring model. This acronym stands for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, and the model scores each potential initiative against each of these elements.\nUsing this method helps teams compare the relative ROI of each project under consideration based on how many people will realize meaningful value from it, along with how certain the team feels about that and how much work it will take. This really shifts the internal debate to consider each idea holistically to make realistic cost-benefit calculations to drive their roadmap, staffing, and more.\nStill hungry for more?\nSuppose those 10 pieces haven’t sated your craving for top-notch product management content.

Sounds nice, doesn’t it? Until you’ve got five stakeholders sitting in an enclosed space spitting out “Must Haves” like watermelon seeds in a county fair contest. Ideas are great, but a strategy everyone can agree on is better. How can you get from one extreme to the other? How can you improve your product strategy meetings?\nSuccessful product strategy meetings don’t happen by accident — they require planning and expert execution. So here’s a 5-step formula to help make your meetings run more smoothly and effectively, and round up those maverick cats.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nStep 1: Set one objective — just one — no cheating\nBecause a product strategy meeting is generally a high-level discussion, you can expect your attendees to come ready to brainstorm, pontificate, philosophize — even argue. This is all okay, even beneficial, as long as the discussion does not stray from your meeting’s single strategic objective.\nWithout an ultimate strategic focus, these meetings can quickly devolve from productive discussions about planning your product roadmap to heated debates about a specific feature. Or worse, they can devolve into several simultaneous arguments across the room, with attendees debating features, colors, deadlines, budgets, and other non-strategic details.\nThis is why it’s a good idea to set a single strategic objective for your meeting. Here are a few examples:\nAchieving a specific revenue target for your product in the next fiscal year.\nIncreasing the number of users (including free-trial users) over the next 6 months.\nMaintaining your current market position for the next two fiscal quarters.\nNotice that these are “SMART” goals — specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.\nNow, as soon as you open the meeting, you will want to communicate this objective with your attendees — and get their buy-in.\nEstablishing this strategic objective at the outset of the meeting will help ensure that you and the other attendees are able to quickly identify the moment the meeting gets off-topic, so you can steer it back on track.\nAnd if your meeting does drift from its single strategic objective, you’ll be ready with Step 2…\nStep 2: Pave paradise, and put up a parking lot for off-topic ideas\nIn a free-flowing stakeholder discussion about your product’s future, it is almost inevitable that the conversation will lead to ideas and suggestions that are valuable, but not relevant to your single strategic objective. What then?\nThese are the moments when you want to be able to say, “That’s a great idea… but a bit off-topic. Let’s park it for later.”\nAnd the best way to do this is to actually have an idea parking lot on which you can jot down the idea and the person who proposed it.\nYour idea parking lot can be a whiteboard on the wall or a freestanding flip board in the meeting room. You could also simply keep a piece of paper in front of you during the meeting — but ideally, the parking lot will be visible to everyone in the room at all times. Often if a person sees their idea captured in a visible place, with their name written beside it, they will feel validated as being heard.\nStep 3: Leave your egos at the door, along with sharp objects and tuna fish sandwiches\nOften a product strategy discussion will drift into controversial subjects…\n“Should we even keep focusing on this part of the product? Our competitors have this segment of the market already.”\n“Do any of our customers actually care about this functionality anymore? We’re spending a lot of development cycles on it, and no one seems to be using it.”\nAddressing difficult topics like these can be invaluable to the long-term success of your product. But sometimes the participants in your meeting who have firsthand knowledge or data about these issues are uncomfortable sharing them in a meeting full of executives who outrank them, product managers who obviously care about the product, and developers who’ve built it.\nThis is why it’s a great idea to encourage open discussion about the product in these meetings — from anyone. Your product strategy meetings are by nature typically positive, forward-looking conversations. But you need to use these meetings to air everything related to your single strategic objective — good, bad, and ugly.\nOne great way to set this open discussion for your meeting culture is with a sign on the door — “You are entering an ego-free zone.”\nStep 4: Be ready to defend your strategy with data\nOf course, this culture that you want to create for your product strategy meetings — where everyone is encouraged to offer their thoughts, good or bad — does not mean that every opinion itself should be treated equally.\nIf you want to propose a specific strategic plan, you should be prepared to back up that plan with evidence — not merely your gut instinct.\nA product strategy meeting can easily turn into a battle of opinions. And in a meeting where many of the attendees are executives who outrank you, it can be difficult to have the confidence to stand behind your strategic ideas if you can’t back them up with hard evidence.\nFurthermore, executives often have a bias for data because they know that every decision represents a risk — and people are often more comfortable with risk if it has hard evidence supporting it.\nStep 5: Communicate your agreed-upon strategy after the meeting\nWhen you have achieved the ultimate goal of your meeting — an agreed-upon product strategy for you to begin driving — you will want to take one more step before digging into the execution.\nBecause people often hear things differently in meetings like these, it is a good idea to recap for everyone who participated exactly what the team agreed would be the product strategy.\nAnd the best way to do this will be with a clear, plain-language recap — accompanied, ideally, by an early draft of your visual product roadmap.\nNobody trips and falls into successful product strategy meetings — you have to create them on purpose\nIf this formula doesn’t jive with your company culture, feel free to deviate and iterate. My problem-solving method of choice is to make a list of everything that might happen and what I’d like to have happened and draw up plans beforehand. As with everything, planning ahead is the key to success, even with challenges like competing ideas, strong opinions, and limited resources. You can still unite your stakeholders around a single strategic objective, and go from there.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/better-product-strategy-meetings/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925698699,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Blog","text":"\n \n \n \n Read about ProductPlan’s culture, product releases, and thought-leadership.

Over drinks and snacks at General Assembly’s brand new downtown location, we discussed tools and techniques with talented product managers from a variety of industries.\nThe focus of the event was on how product managers can plan, execute and measure their way to better products. The “product stack,” similar to a development stack of commonly used technologies for developers, is meant to be an ever-evolving toolkit — composed of both literal software tools and figurative tools, like prioritization models and communication best practices — to help product managers be more successful at every stage of the product development cycle.\nWe plan to hold more Product Stack events in the near future and to continue growing our toolbox. To start, we’re hosting a joint Product Stack webinar together with product leaders from Pivotal and Notion on March 15th — you can register here.\nSuzanne Abate, CEO of The Development Factory and host of 100 PM (a popular product management podcast), moderated our LA event and interviewed representatives from each of the three companies about the problem that their product helps solve.\nJim Semick, one of our co-founders, discussed how ProductPlan started after interviewing over 70 product managers and learning that communicating the roadmap was a common challenge. Below is the video (and full transcript, if you prefer reading) of Jim and Suzanne’s conversation. (You can also check out Suzanne’s interview with Pivotal Tracker GM, Dan Podsedly on the Pivotal Tracker blog.)\nAlso in the interview:\nBenefits of doing exhaustive market validation before writing a single line of code\nWhy we eat our own dog food at ProductPlan\nHow to stay agile — even when you’re an enterprise-level PM\nFull Transcript\nSuzanne Abate (SA): Jim Semick, welcome.\nJim Semick (JS): Thank you.\nSA: Thank you for joining us. You are the Co-Founder of ProductPlan. What’s ProductPlan?\nJS: ProductPlan is web-based product roadmap software. We have companies all over the world using our software to visualize their product roadmap.\nSA: It’s interesting that you built a planning software because as I understand it, you spent a lot of time planning what kind of business you were going to build. I’m talking a little bit about the journey that you and Greg took to arrive at ProductPlan. Can you share that story here with our audience?\nJS: Sure. I’ve been in product management a new product development for almost 20 years. I was the first product manager for GoToMyPC and GoToMeeting, both Citrix products. Then I was part of the founding team of a company called AppFolio, which is based out of Santa Barbara, and they do B2B property management software.\nIn all those roles, I was at the very early stages of figuring out what the product was going to be. I wrote the original PRD, for example, for GoToMeeting. At that point, you have a blank sheet of paper. You can envision whatever you want the product to be.\nI have a background in customer development and new product development, and in figuring out what new products are going to be. Who are the customers? What are the pain points that you’re going to solve? What are the features that it has to have? What’s the go-to-market strategy?\nWhen we decided to start ProductPlan, it was essentially a blank sheet of paper, and it wasn’t even called ProductPlan. We didn’t have a name for the company. We had few ideas knocking around in our head, and based on my experience from starting and launching other products, we did extensive market validation. Some would say it was pretty exhaustive. We actually interviewed 70 different product managers to figure out what that product was going to be.\nI’m a little bit detailed I suppose. I documented every one of those interviews, and asked people if we could record the interviews, and had my matrices, and so on. I tried to figure out exactly what the problem was that we were solving.\nAnd so that was the beginning of ProductPlan. We actually had gone through this exhaustive market validation process before we wrote a single line of code. Unlike the lean startup method, where you start writing code, and then putting that in front of people, and scrapping it, and pivoting, and moving onto something else, we decided to do it right from the first moment.\nBut before that point, Greg and I talked a lot about what we wanted to have in terms of a company. We talked about the culture that we wanted to build. We talked about the size of company that we wanted. We talked about what type of product we wanted to build. We talked about whether it would be B2B or B2C. So we had that framework before we started picking product ideas to validate.\nWe went about it a little bit differently than I think a lot of startups go about it. I think a lot of that is because Greg and I have been around for a while and we’ve launched products before. We had an idea of how we wanted to do this ourselves.\nSA: You’re a practical gentlemen. I think what’s interesting about it for me is that you hear so much about the story of somebody who’s got a $2 billion idea. And the only thing between them and this $2 billion idea is a company to build it out. And then they’re going to be rich, and they’re going to sell it to Facebook.\nThat’s rarely the actual story, but a lot of people start with the idea, and then if they’re lucky, figure out that it’s a salable, scalable idea. In your case, you said let’s just work backwards from what the market actually needs and create something compelling.\nJS: Exactly. The original validation that we started didn’t have anything to do with product roadmaps. We did our pivoting very early on in the process. Our original concept was another product for product managers to help them track their customer interviews, and to help them catalog and communicate the learnings that they were collecting.\nAnd while the market said, that’s an interesting idea, it soon became evident that the bigger pain point was around communicating the strategy, and around communicating the product roadmap. And so we caught on to that fairly early on, and did our pivoting early.\nSA: What is the primary problem that ProductPlan is actually seeking to solve?\nMaybe I’ll preface it by saying, for the benefit of anyone in the room who doesn’t know what roadmapping is, what’s a high level description of roadmapping, and how does your product help?\nJS: Most companies have some sort of a document or some way of communicating to stakeholders, and to executives, and even to customers what it is that they’ll be building.\nSometimes these are PowerPoint presentations, and sometimes they’re spreadsheets, but there is some product that they’re using. Sometimes it’s Google Docs. Every product manager in every company has a stakeholder — whether it’s your end customer, or whether it’s the CEO, or whether it’s the VP of Product, you need to communicate with those folks.\nAnd so the key challenge is that the current tools out there don’t do a good job of communicating the why. They don’t do a good job of explaining, why are we doing this in the first place?\nI also think that, in a lot of organizations, there’s this preconceived notion that because it’s on the roadmap it’s the right thing to do. The executives might sit around the table and say, okay, this is what we’re going to be building. That gets announced to all of the employees, and maybe the customers, and maybe the investors. And then the product doesn’t do very well.\nSo what we’re trying to do is connect the strategy of why you’re doing something with the end result, which is building x, y, and z feature. That’s what our product does; the problem that we solve is that we help you through that process. We help you communicate the strategy effectively to stakeholders in a way that they understand.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nSA: You brought up the simplicity of tools. A lot of what we’re here talking about tonight is tools, right? Using tools to be effective as product managers, but sometimes, we don’t have the right tools.\nWe’re using Google Docs, or we’re using spreadsheets. So what are some of the specific challenges that you’ve seen arise in the context of roadmapping from not having the right process?\nJS: Yeah, and just to be clear, I’m not plugging ProductPlan.\nI think there are a lot of different ways of communicating the strategy. But I think some of the deficiencies that we caught on to early in our market validation process were that a lot of product managers, especially those who are new or maybe don’t have formal product management training, create a list of features — or worse, they have the backlog in their ticket tracking system — and they consider that to be the roadmap.\nFrom our standpoint, and from the perspective of seasoned product managers that we spoke with early on, that’s not an effective way of communicating. You get lost in the weeds too easily.\nYou can’t see the forest for the trees. You aren’t able to take those details, especially those detailed stories, and roll them up into the big picture.\nSo that was a problem and a pain point that we caught on to really early. The product managers that have been around the block know how to do it. They know how to roll up features into the theme level, for example. They know how to say, okay we’re going to be implementing these features, and this is the reason why we’re doing this; this is strategically why it’s better for our customers, or better for the product, or better for the company.\nSA: Can you share with us how ProductPlan goes about roadmapping. What is your process? Take us through it.\nJS: Our internal process?\nSA: Yeah, we want all your proprietary information.\nJS: Sure, okay.\nSA: And then we want to leverage it.\nJS: Yeah, just so you know, we do eat our own dog food. We use our own product. We have our own product roadmap that communicates what we’re going to be doing over about the next six months or so, and it constantly updates.\nI think some of you here work for larger companies, and that roadmapping process is probably longer term. The most common length of roadmap that we see when we’re talking to our customers is about a year.\nBut, ProductPlan has been around about four years, and we’re a smaller, more agile organization, so we tend to look over about the next six months. We just went through a planning process for 2017 and communicated that to all the folks who work for us. Everything was described in terms of bigger level themes.\nSA: What’s an example of a theme at a big level?\nJS: A theme might be an API.\nFor example, we know that integrations are important for our customers; getting data in and out of various systems is very important, and so we’re going to be developing an API. It’s in development, but we don’t know exactly what it’s going to look like at the end of 2017.\nSaying exactly what we’re going to be building is not really the best way to go about it for a company like ours because we are constantly learning. Our roadmap should be constantly evolving. We should be working with our customers every day to really understand the pain that we’re solving.\nSo, that’s a little bit about our big-picture planning process. And then we also use our internal prioritization tool, we call it the Planning Board, and it’s basically a scoring matrix. We can put different items on the scoring matrix and look at them on value versus cost scale.\nI think a lot of product managers use some sort of a framework or a scoring mechanism to rank items. How many of you use a spreadsheet?\nSA: Show of hands for spreadsheets.\nJS: Okay, I see a few.\nSA: Get those sheepish hands up. It’s a good tool.\nJS: There are a dozen different ways of doing this. There are a dozen different frameworks that you can use to prioritize, but most product managers go through, at least in their heads, this value versus cost matrix. Of course, you want to be developing the things that are highest value and lowest cost. That’s the low-hanging fruit.\nSo we use our product, which kind of bakes that into the process.\nThat’s a little bit about our internal process for prioritizing. But, I’ll tell you, we still don’t know at the end of the year exactly what we’re going to be building because it’s constantly evolving.\nSA: It’s interesting, you brought up before that people rely on the backlog to sort of be “the thing”. This is something that comes up on the 100 PM podcast a lot — the challenge for product managers to weave between the strategic role, the the forward looking role, and then the more more tactical, execution based role. If you’re too much in the backlog, you’re only seeing as far out as what’s going to ship next week, next month, or whatever it is.\nAnd as you mentioned, you’re agile, and you’re a smaller shop, so I’m curious about your thoughts for larger organizations. How do they avoid falling into that trap of being stuck in “well, this is what we planned” mode? I’ve talked to enterprise product managers who have roadmaps that have hooks into three and five years out. I’m like, I don’t even know what I’m doing for dinner tonight.\nJS: I know, that boggles my mind.\nSA: So what advice would you offer, or what can you say to enterprise-level product managers as a tips, I suppose, for staying agile in the planning process?\nJS: A lot of product managers have so many things that they need to accomplish during the day — so many fires that they need to put out, a backlog that needs to be prioritized, an engineer standing at their desk asking clarification questions. There’s a tendency to fall into that tactical mode, and I’ve been guilty of it myself, where it’s really hard to come up for air.\nI find that baking customer development and customer discovery into your daily process helps, and making sure that you’re continually engaging with customers. Whether that’s somebody scheduling a customer call on your behalf, or whether it’s you reaching out to customers or sitting in on calls with the customer success team or whoever usually engages with the customers. I think continually listening to that constant stream of feedback from the customers is the best way to get perspective.\nAnd I know, it’s really hard. I think probably all of you have that fighting fires mentality. And that’s one of the wonderful things about being a product manager, you can have your fingers in so many different things. But it’s also a curse because everybody looks to you for the answer.\nI think that keeping tabs on the customers is a really important thing. And I think another thing is letting go a little bit — not letting other people rely on you for the answer all the time. I’ve been in that mode myself in the past where you’re seen as the single point of truth for everything. Letting that go and letting dev teams make their own decisions, and if your corporate culture allows it, allowing the UX team to take on more responsibility — I think that’s another important thing that you can do.\nBy doing those things, you can bring it up a level and be a little more strategic about what you’re doing.\nSA: You have been around for four years, do you consider yourself a start up still at this point?\nJS: Yeah absolutely. I feel that even though we’re selling into enterprises — we have customers like Intuit using our products — we’re still very much a startup in two senses.\nOne is that we are very agile. We have the big picture plan of four big things we want to accomplish this year, but how we get there is still TBD, and the exact features that we build to get there are TBD.\nI think the other thing is that Greg and I have a vision for the product. We have a long term vision for where this product needs to be, years down the road. There’s still more to do, there’s so much more to accomplish to fulfill that vision. And so from those perspectives, I think we’re definitely a startup.\nSA: I’m curious how the landscape has changed? When you did come to market four years ago, were there other products like ProductPlan?\nJS: Yeah, right about the time that we came on the scene some other products started to come out — products specifically for product managers. And since we’ve launched, there have been other products that do product roadmapping, and really that’s okay with me —\nSA: You’re going to allow competitors? That’s generous.\nJS: I’m okay with it; I’m not freaked out by any of it.\nWhen we were validating GoToMeeting, there were 70 other online meeting products on the market already. With GoToMeeting, we were still able to disrupt the market with a product that was easier to use and had a unique pricing model that hadn’t yet been introduced into the marketplace.\nI actually think that competition does so many things. It shows you that there is a market, for one, and it gives you an opportunity to differentiate. I think that with our company and our product, we have some unique differentiators, when you compare it to other products.\nThe landscape is changing, but in a very positive way. And most importantly, I think it’s changing a lot for product managers. How many product managers do we have here who have been at it for more than five years?\nFor those of you who’ve been in the industry for a while, you’ve seen the difference. You’ve seen all of these new products coming on the market, and you’ve seen organizations like General Assembly that are providing more education for product managers. I think that it’s a very positive thing for all of us when there’s more education, and when there are more tools and products available to help us do a better job.\nThe important things that we do aren’t managing backlogs or creating product roadmaps or things like that, but rather thinking strategically. It’s about engaging with customers and understanding customer pain. Those sorts of things are the important things. So anything that product managers have at their disposal to do a better job at being strategic, I think is a positive thing for the industry and for the occupation.\nSA: And market research is so much a part of the role. It’s not that you come out into the market and then you can close your mind. There’s always someone lurking around the corner with the next disruptive idea.\nI think the challenge as it pertains to roadmapping and product vision really is, on one hand, you want to make sure that you are staying current and that you are not being disrupted. And on the other hand, you want to make sure you are not being blown about by every wind. “Well, my competitor just built this feature, so we should build it too.”\nHow do you manage that? How do you differentiate yourselves or hold true to your vision despite whatever your competitors are doing?\nJS: Yeah, that’s a great question because we’re faced with that challenge every day. A small example is that we are a product management software, and we think of ourselves as this strategic layer on top of project management software — products like Pivotal Tracker, for example, which manage the more detailed tasks that need to happen to develop products.\nBut we’re always asked for project management-oriented features, and so it takes a lot of willpower on our part to say no. We want to continue to maintain what we’re good at, which is visualizing the strategy, and we want to keep that focus. It’s kind of a constant battle for us to maintain that.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/building-software-company/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925800241,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Can Product Squads Improve Your Agile Development Process?","text":"\n Product squads are a relatively new methodology for product development popularized by Spotify. Actually, popularized might be too strong a term for it. Since 2012, when Spotify restructured its development organization into functional, eight-person squads — developers and a product owner — much has been written about this novel approach. But it seems few organizations have actually adopted it.\nThere are several legitimate reasons why product squads might not make sense for your organization. I’ll discuss those below, along with the reasons it might indeed be a way to improve your product development.\nBut first, let’s take a step back to discuss how we got here. How and why has the process of product management and development evolved?\nFrom Waterfall to Agile to Product Squads (or Maybe Not)\nWaterfall is a very linear approach to creating products. Much of the work is done up front, with product managers working in a clear sequence of steps. First, they plan, design and document essentially everything they can think of with regard to what will be needed for their product’s development. When that is complete, they hand off this documentation to their developers for execution.\nAnd although it is still popular in some larger software organizations — primarily because it allows for strict deadlines and managerial controls — waterfall has several drawbacks.\nIn many software organizations, waterfall product development has given way to agile.\nThe agile development methodology emphasizes people over processes, and communication and testing over documentation. As the agile thinking goes, let’s be collaborative and quick. And let’s let the market itself tell us whether or not we’re succeeding — rather than simply deciding we’ve executed successfully because we faithfully stayed on track with our product roadmap.\nThat’s where the concept of product squads comes in. \nIn a way, Spotify’s approach to product squads is the next logical step in further streamlining the agile method.\nThe way Spotify has set them up, each of these squads consists of a small team of developers and one product owner — usually, but not necessarily, a product manager. What makes these squads unique? A few things.\nFirst, product squads are responsible for functional areas of the company’s product line; they do not work across entire products or on ad hoc projects assigned by management. For example, one squad might focus on exclusively search technology. This allows the company to develop significant expertise and intellectual capital across each functional area of its offering. In other words, it can build teams of true industry experts, rather than a single large team of coding generalists.\nPhoto Credit: Spotify\nThe second way product squads deviate from traditional product development approaches is that they are given real autonomy. In fact, Spotify thinks of its squads as independent startups.\nWhat does that mean in practical terms? It means that a squad can select its own areas of functional responsibility to work on. Once it has taken on such an area — again, search technology, for example — it can update the production version of its product anytime. It can push work out to users without waiting for approvals from anyone outside the squad.\nDownload How Agile Product Managers Can Build Better Products ➜\nSo the basic idea is that product squads can lead to much more efficient product development, teams who are highly knowledgeable about the product’s various functional areas, faster development cycles, and ultimately more successful products.\nIs the product squad approach right for your organization? It depends. There are benefits and drawbacks, and it isn’t a clear fit for every organizational culture. Keep reading to get an understanding of whether or not it could work for you.\nTwo Reasons the Squad Method Might Improve Your Product Development\n1. It can generate true in-house expertise.\nThe product manager in a squad has a much greater ability to learn about his functional area than he would if he were responsible for an entire product. Sticking with search as our example, a product owner at Spotify can become an unrivaled expert on the technology — how search can be used to improve the overall user experience, best practices, and all of the latest industry improvements.\nIf that product manager were responsible for the entire product, however, he would only be able to spend so much time on search — or anything else for that matter. He would also have equal responsibility for learning about partner channels, pricing models, securing music contracts, researching the latest developments on UX, and on and on.\nBy assigning squads to complementary areas of functional responsibility across your product line, you can allow for tremendous knowledge among both your product owners and developers. In fact, this can be a key differentiator for your company, because your competitors will likely still be developing in the everyone-works-on-everything model.\n2. It can speed everything: development, feedback and learning, and updates.\nBecause squads are permanent, small teams, its members get to know each other well, developing chemistry and a team shorthand that can speed the work.\nAlso, because the squad has the authority to release its product updates directly to the market anytime it wants, it can more quickly learn what’s working and what isn’t. It can then autonomously make improvements and push right back out to its user base.\nThe squad approach can in some cases be a perfect addition to an agile environment because it supports one of the most important agile principles:\n“Working software is the primary measure of progress.” \nThe more quickly your product squads are able to update the product and push those updates to market, the more quickly they’ll be able to determine if they’re working or how they can be further improved. Ultimately, that will generally lead to a more successful product.\nDownload the Product Development Roadmap Checklist ➜\nThree Reasons the Squad Method Might Undermine Your Product Development\nBut your organization might, for several reasons, not benefit from adopting the squad approach. In fact, for many types of companies, this method can even harm your development efforts. Here’s how.\n1. Your product line might not support this model.\nRemember, the product squad approach was developed, or at least popularized, by Spotify — a SaaS company. They obviously coded their product in a framework that allows for tinkering and tweaking here and there without negatively affecting any other parts of the product.\nBecause their code is segmented to such an extent that they can modify the radio functionality without touching their search code, for example, the squad method of autonomous team updates makes perfect sense for Spotify.\nWhat if you sell multiple interrelated products and services, and they were constructed such that an update to one area of a product might affect everything else?\nYou probably wouldn’t want to restructure your development and product management organizations into squads, because you couldn’t give those small groups the autonomy to update the live products. Otherwise, their updates could jeopardize the stability of the rest of the product.\nAdditionally, if your product has many components with interdependencies, you would often have instances where one squad had to wait for support from another squad. And this would remove much of the value of operating under a squad model in the first place.\nGet Strategic Project Alignment ➜\n2. You risk breaking your in-house product knowledge into silos.\nIn an agile context, a product manager’s primary role is to educate the developers on the product’s personas and the problems the product should solve for those personas. In other words, product managers should have a comprehensive understanding of the product as a whole.\nBut if you break your resources into squads responsible for functional areas, you are in effect dicing up the overall, strategic-level product knowledge across several product owners. Although they might become unrivaled experts in their functional areas, these product owners likely won’t have a full strategic understanding of the entire product. That’s risky.\nAdditionally, by making your developers hyper-specialists in a few functional areas, without also allowing them to work at times on other projects, you risk isolating your company’s coding talent from the big-picture view of the product?\nSo if your squads don’t interconnect well and often, then you run the risk of information silos. Who at your organization will have full product knowledge? Which product managers? Which developers? Will any of them?\n3. You could lose some of the advocacy from both product management and development.\nA third reason squads might not work is that a product’s success often depends on maintaining some distance and objectivity between product management and development. The product owner should be focusing on product vision, strategy, the what. They should then be communicating this to development, who should focus on the how.\nSo it’s not necessarily a bad approach to have a little tension between product management and development. Product managers should be looking to push boundaries, try new things, and implement themes that might not be so easy for development.\nDevelopers will be motivated to complete the challenges put before them as efficiently and quickly as possible. But the product manager will at times have strategic reasons for wanting to execute on an initiative in a given way — one that might be at odds with the development team’s way of thinking.\nBut if the product manager is on the same team as the developers, you run the risk that she won’t ask for X because she knows that within her team’s functional area of responsibility, the framework will make it easier to implement Y instead.\nThink of the embedded-journalist problem. When war correspondents embed themselves with a military detachment and go out on missions under their protection, you can imagine how difficult it can be for those journalists to then report the facts objectively, particularly if their report would portray the military team unfavorably.\nThe same potential problem exists with embedding a product manager on a development team.\nThe product will likely enjoy more success when both product managers and developers are advocating strongly in favor of what they see as best for the product — even if doing so creates a bit of tension between both teams.\nProduct Squads: Interesting Approach to Product Development, But Not Right for Everyone\nProduct squads seem to be a great way to build strong, knowledgeable development teams.\nThey also offer perhaps the best development framework yet to allow companies to quickly and efficiently build and release products and then improve upon them based on how their markets react.\nMoreover, they seem to be a logical extension of the agile philosophy. Indeed, one of the more important agile principles is: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.” \nAnd remember, agile development itself is all about doing what works best rather than adhering to any process or development rule.\nIf the product squad approach sounds like a fit for your organization, it might be worth a try.\nBut if you’re not sure to what degree your product can handle independent updates at various times, or you worry about sacrificing overall product knowledge to build up your organization’s functional expertise, then you might want to investigate the squad method more deeply first. Implementing the wrong product development strategy can create more problems than it solves.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-squads/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925716057,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"ChatGPT and Product Management: A ProductPlan Engineering Experiment","text":"\n I know what you’re thinking. Oh no, not another blog about ChatGPT.\nHowever, even if you’re sick of hearing about this already notorious artificial intelligence tool’s strange adventures, it’s likely here to stay, and we’re only scratching the surface of the impact of this cutting-edge technology.\nThere have been countless stories, tests, and experiments using this fascinating chatbot. One that caught my attention is the bizarre conversations a New York Times reporter had with Microsoft’s new A.I.-powered Bing search engine.\nAwkward confessions of love aside, there is no doubt that ChatGPT and other AI tools like it are poised to impact every aspect of our lives. And product management is not immune to this new era of artificial intelligence.\nMany product professionals have started tinkering with ChatGPT to understand its impact on product management. The emergence of AI in product management is simultaneously being welcomed with a red carpet, ignored as nothing more than a fad, and outright shunned as death, a destroyer of worlds.\nWe’re no different at ProductPlan. Our research and development department is constantly evaluating technological innovations and enhancements to better understand the future of our end-to-end product management platform.\nSo without further ado, I am excited to share our recent ChatGPT experiment.\nThe premise: How can we use ChatGPT in the Productplan platform?\nThe premise is simple. Can we use a tool like ChatGPT in our product management platform? What types of tasks or ceremonies in the platform would benefit from artificial intelligence? Our goal is to support the creative and intelligent product professionals that use our platform—not replace them with AI. The point is to make these product folks more efficient so they can focus on more high-value tasks like strategy and launching innovative products and features.\nWith this in mind, we turned our focus toward shaping our hypothesis.\nOur hypothesis: An AI tool like ChatGPT can help product managers save time when setting up a roadmap.\nA common question we hear from customers who are newer to roadmapping, in general, is, “Where do I start?” Anyone who has sat down the night before an essay is due in school can relate to that daunting feeling of staring at a blank page. And roadmapping is no different.\nThe beauty of ProductPlan is our ease of use and the way our platform gives product managers ultimate control over how they want to build their roadmap. Yet, we understand that total freedom can be paralyzing, so we heavily invest in implementation and customer support to set our customers up for success in our platform.\nSo, we thought—what if we could build a brainstorming tool to assist a Product Manager in creating an Agile roadmap in a few minutes? The challenge is figuring out how ChatGPT can be implemented into our existing roadmap functionality in our platform. Our goal was to create a seamless experience where artificial intelligence works directly with a roadmap.\nHere’s How IT Services Can Make a Compelling Roadmap ➜\nThe experiment: Building an Agile roadmap using artificial intelligence in the ProductPlan app.\nWe started with the concept of an Assistant Planner. Imagine you’ve sat down on an empty roadmap and pulled open the Table Layout to seed Parked Items. You have a feature in mind, but the details needed to plan it escape you. This is where the Assistant Planner comes in:\n“Tell us about the feature that you plan to work on?”\nYou type…\n“Plan a marketing campaign for a new Tesla pickup truck with a focus age group of 25 to 35.”\nThis sends a request to OpenAI, integrating with GPT-3 to return a list of sequenced tasks, separated into necessary phases to launch the campaign, all ready to be imported into your roadmap:\nPhase 1: Research – Research target audience and competitors to understand the market and create a plan for the campaign.\nResearch target audience (age group 25 to 25)\nResearch competitors\nAnalyze market trends\nCreate a plan for the campaign\nPhase 2: Design – Design the campaign materials, including visuals, copy, and other elements.\nCreate visuals for the campaign\nWrite copy for the campaign\nDesign other elements (e.g. landing page, email template, etc)\nPhase 3: Launch – Launch the campaign and track results.\nLaunch campaign\nTrack results (e.g. impressions, clicks, conversations, etc.)\nThe results: ChatGPT successfully built an Agile roadmap in just a few minutes with a simple prompt.\nWell, it worked! Our engineer demoed the prototype of the ChatGPT functionality for the research and development team during a recent all-hands meeting. It was incredibly impressive what our engineer was able to accomplish during their dedicated passion project time.\nIn Conclusion: The future of AI looks bright, and we’re excited to continue researching and experimenting to build our end-to-end product management platform.\nI hope you enjoyed reading through our AI experiment. For now, we have no formal plans to sell a ChatGPT-powered roadmap builder. We believe there’s much to learn about artificial intelligence’s role in product management. And we’re in no hurry to implement a tool that still gives funny yet strange results.\nMore importantly, I hope you liked this brief snapshot of some of the incredible work our research and development teams do behind the scenes.

If so, you know how difficult it is to ensure that multiple product portfolio views have a standardized legend.\nHowever, maintaining a consistent structure and vocabulary can improve a business’s ability to communicate strategic goals. The solution? We’ve added a new Shared Legends feature to the ProductPlan roadmap app.\nI spoke with hundreds of roadmap users at large organizations. They told me how challenging it is for admins to maintain workflows and standardize multiple roadmaps. The time investment to have each team member update and standardize their roadmaps was a burden for them.\nHere are some of the most common challenges that may sound familiar to you. I’ll also explain how the Shared Legends feature can support better roadmap communications within your team.\n3 Ways Shared Legends Can Help Improve Your Roadmap Communications\n1. “I need to be able to lock down legends across roadmaps.”\nOne admin described the frustration of creating a legend and asking roadmap owners across the company to use it—only to find some were changing colors or modifying the text.\nUsing a consistent legend across roadmaps is essential for clear communication when accessing the portfolio view. If a company decides to use the legend to present strategic objectives, it doesn’t want roadmap editors to add new or modify labels. If an initiative doesn’t align with an existing strategic purpose, it probably shouldn’t be on the roadmap right now.\nSolution: Admins are the only ones who can modify a shared legend.\nShared Legends allows admins to limit edit access. If editors use a shared legend for their roadmaps, they will have to use the legend labels and other details as-is, ensuring consistency across company roadmaps.\n2. “We want to make a legend change once—not 30 times.”\nAs another ProductPlan customer explains, “Following up one by one with 30 PMs isn’t scalable. When we make a change to the legend, we need that change to impact all roadmaps using that legend.”\nWhen a product leader needs to make a small change to legend text or color before a big presentation, there are many roadmaps to update when they could be doing other things like preparing for the presentation itself.\nSolution: Shared legend modifications are automatically reflected across all roadmaps using the legend.\nWhen an admin updates a shared legend, that update will automatically populate across every roadmap using that shared legend.\n3. “We need to make the portfolio view easier to configure and read.”\nAs a result, we built Shared Legends to address this common challenge that we heard from our enterprise customers. They have many active roadmaps at any given time that different owners manage. Admins at larger companies often find that creating a roadmap portfolio view requires manual work.\nOne product team labeled its development work with a blue bar and called it “Development” in the legend, and another assigned it red and called it “Dev team.” Merging these roadmaps would require the admin to review the details of both, reconcile the red-blue discrepancies, and then create a standard label for the development work, which could take hours.\nSolution: Shared legend for portfolio views.\nThe admin can now use ProductPlan’s Shared Legends feature to create a consistent legend convention for each roadmap and roll those roadmaps into a portfolio view requiring manual legend reconciliation.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nThe New Shared Legends Feature in ProductPlan’s Roadmap App in Action\nShared Legends automates the process of standardizing legends for the entire company. Here’s what it means for each type of roadmap user:\nAdmins can create a standard legend in the ProductPlan roadmap app to make it accessible to roadmap owners across the company. If you’re an admin on your company’s roadmaps, this means you can create consistency and alignment on roadmaps across your company. Moreover, you won’t need to update every roadmap whenever your team makes a change manually.\nEditors can apply the shared legend to their roadmaps, saving them time from creating their own and ensuring their legend reflects the vocabulary, color-coding, and other details agreed on by the company. If you’re an editor, this also means you can get up and running with a standardized legend quickly with the confidence that you’re adhering to best practices established by your team leads.\nViewers of the company’s roadmaps will have a consistent experience analyzing each project’s strategic goals and status on each roadmap. If you’re a viewer, this means you’ll be able to quickly understand any roadmap across your company because you’ll be familiar with the legend conventions.\nConduct Better Roadmap Communication with Shared Legends\nThe Shared Legends feature in ProductPlan’s roadmap app is a first of its kind. When your team deploys this feature, your roadmap admins and editors will know that:\nThe terms used to describe your goals, priority levels, project status, and teams will always be consistent with other roadmaps across the company. (No more duplicate labels or confusion about terminology.)\nThe spelling, grammatical details, and color-coding of your roadmap legend will perfectly match the company’s different roadmaps. (No more manually fixing your labels to match other roadmaps before rolling into a portfolio view.)\nThe legend you create will merge seamlessly with the legends of your company’s other roadmaps when you combine them into a single view. (No more manual work to align legends when rolling roadmaps into a portfolio view.)\nIf you maintain several roadmaps or work on a team with many product managers, this will be a timesaving game-changer.\nTry out shared legends today, and let me know what you think in the comments.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/shared-legends/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925709340,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Connect Product Strategy to Execution in ProductPlan","text":"\n Finally, a place for strategy in ProductPlan. \nProductPlan has long been your single source of truth for the what, when, and how behind your product.

They detail the major initiatives planned over a given amount of time. They visualize what you’re building next. They map how different projects support each other. \nHowever, as a tool for communicating product plans, a roadmap often isn’t the right place to summarize high-level goals. We’ve spoken with many customers who have a separate document for their product strategy. It lives in a PowerPoint or spreadsheet, untethered from the work happening across the roadmap.\nOur first step in supporting strategy within ProductPlan was to create a designated space for it. You no longer have to cobble together a view of your strategic priorities by utilizing your Lanes or Legend. These features are now free to help you visualize other important information on your roadmap, like team ownership or status. \nInstead, we now have a new space in ProductPlan to capture your product organization’s major objectives. These can be measurable outcomes you’re hoping to achieve, broader themes or areas of focus, and other product-specific goals. \nGive your team easy access to the product strategy at any time. This allows the strategy to stay front and center whenever your team needs to plan new initiatives or prioritize what to focus on. \nRequest a Demo >\nA straightforward way to map strategy to execution\n“Why are you doing what you’re doing?” is a question product people get time and time again. It’s a complicated request. It requires a product manager to account for a variety of determining factors, from resource capacities to customer feedback. \nBut at the heart of every new product, release, or initiative has to be a thread connecting it to the organization’s goals. The best way to justify work is to show how it supports the product strategy.\nYou can now easily map initiatives represented as your roadmap bars or containers to company objectives. With this ability, you can give each initiative a true north star that guides decision-making. You can also create a roadmap view by company objective in seconds, making it easy to present how you plan to execute your strategy.  \nShow progress toward goal completion at a glance\nFinally, we want to help you report on progress. Any good product OKR has a series of key results that help you quantify the success or failure of a particular objective. \nWe first want to help you answer the questions, “How close are we to reaching our goals, and what’s left to do?” \nProductPlan can now show you how many of the initiatives mapped to your objectives are complete out of the total. This can be great for ‘at a glance’ assessments of progress. See which objectives are falling behind and which are ahead of schedule. Then drill into your roadmaps to understand what’s left to do. \nWhile this is where we’re starting, it’s not where we want to end. There’s more to measuring success than reporting on completed outputs. As we develop Strategy further, we look forward to building out our reporting capabilities. What would it look like to track the cost of investment, for example? \nAs you use the new tool, you’ll see an option to provide feedback on what other kinds of reporting you’d like to see. We’d love to hear from you. \nRequest a Demo >\nAvailable now in Open Beta\nIf you’re a current ProductPlan customer on either a Professional or Enterprise plan, you can try Strategy in ProductPlan today for free—no need to switch anything on. Simply log in and head to the new Strategy space in the left-hand sidebar. \nIf you’re not a ProductPlan customer but would like a tour, request a demo. Our team will be in touch shortly to walk you through our platform.\nBonus: navigate ProductPlan with ease\nSpeaking of the left-hand sidebar, you’ll likely notice a completely revamped navigation system in ProductPlan. We want to help you easily discover new features (like Strategy) and quickly traverse familiar territory (like Roadmaps) within the ProductPlan platform.\nSo we’ve added enhancements like bread crumbing to help you better keep track of where you’ve been and make it easy to go back. \nLooking forward\nAs an Open Beta feature set, Strategy in ProductPlan is just the beginning. As we move through the beta period, we’ll continue to refine and add new functionality rooted in your feedback. \nLooking forward, we want to focus on connecting strategy to more than just roadmaps in ProductPlan. We want to see it cascade to the discovery process, prioritization, and launch. We also want to build more robust key results capabilities. \nSo stay tuned. \n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/connect-strategy-to-execution/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925795449,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Data-Driven Product Roadmaps: Choosing the Right Metrics","text":"\n Developing an effective product roadmap requires more than a product manager’s intuition and vision, although those elements are crucial. But equally important for an effective roadmap will be evidence, real-world data, and a scientific approach to analyzing that data.\nIn this post, I’d like to share with you some ideas for identifying, tracking, and leveraging the right metrics to help shape your product strategy. These are some of the ideas that I shared in a recent webinar that we co-hosted with Pendo, called “Building Data-Driven Product Roadmaps”.\nNot All Data Are Equally Valuable (Beware of the Vanity Metric)\nBefore we discuss how to leverage data in prioritizing your product roadmap, I want to caution you upfront that not all data is equally useful. Some data, in fact, is a distraction at best, and a source of misleading information at worst. In particular, I want to warn you against focusing too heavily on “vanity metrics.”\nVanity metrics are stats that look great in a press release but don’t necessarily translate in any meaningful way to business results. Examples include the number of Twitter followers or how many people have watched a clever video your company posted on YouTube. In reality, these numbers give product management very little insight into how the product will resonate with customers or how much revenue it will generate.\nTweet This:\n“Not all data are equally valuable (beware of the vanity metric).”\nWorse, when you rely on these sorts of metrics — which can be tempting because they suggest interest and engagement with your company — you risk developing a very skewed view of the actual level of interest in your products. People watch YouTube videos and follow companies on Twitter for lots of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with an interest in those companies’ products or services.\nDownload Product Success Metrics  ➜\nLimit and Prioritize the Metrics You Use in Your Roadmap Decisions\nAnother important point to keep in mind is that with services like Google Analytics, it’s possible to track many different types of data. And that’s great.\nBut trying to make sense of an overwhelming amount of data can also lead to confusion. You probably have a firehose of information available to you right now, so you should first try to figure out what the most important metrics for your product are. This includes the data that will lead to the most valuable and actionable insights into what’s working with your product, what isn’t resonating with users, and how you can continually improve your offering.\nThe ideal number of metrics to track will vary from company to company, of course, but a good rule of thumb is to focus on roughly five metrics that you can monitor over time and discuss regularly with your executive stakeholders.\nAssuming you’ve identified the five most revealing and strategically advantageous metrics to concentrate on, the data you compile from these metrics over time should give you valuable intelligence into how to proceed with your product and what to prioritize on your roadmap.\nFirst, you have to set your product’s strategic goals. Before you can begin sifting through all of the noise and determine which handful of strategically useful metrics to focus on, you need to define your product’s strategic goals.\nThen, when you’ve set those goals, you can start looking for the right mix of metrics to track and analyze, the metrics that will help you achieve those goals.\nNext, start compiling data — here are some great places to look. If you already have a product on the market, with an installed base of users, you can choose from a wide range of real-world metrics to track, which will help you take a more scientific approach to decide where to focus your resources.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nCustomer-Oriented Metrics\nA great way to start is to use the data being generated every day by your prospects and user base to learn what’s working with your product or your efforts to promote it, and what you need to change. These types of metrics might include:\nProduct usage or adoption\nPercentage of prospects or leads who take a specific action in response to your marketing campaigns (e.g., sign up for a trial, download a white paper, etc.)\nPercentage of users who take specific action in the product itself (e.g., use a given feature)\nCustomer retention or churn rate\nQuality (e.g., the number of bugs reported by users, and whether those numbers are going up or down over time)\nBusiness-Oriented Metrics\nYou can also track and analyze important high-level business data relating to your product to help you shape and improve your strategy. These business-oriented metrics will come not from how your customers interact with your product but rather how their actions affect your product’s bottom line. These types of metrics could include:\nCost to acquire a new customer (CAC)\nCustomer lifetime value (LTV)\nMonthly recurring revenue generated by your product (MRR)\nThe average revenue per user\nConversion (e.g., the percentage who convert from free-trial users to customers)\nTo use my own company as an example, at ProductPlan we pay close attention to a handful of these metrics all the time, and they are extremely helpful in guiding how we pursue and adjust our strategy.\nOne of the great things about offering a SaaS-based product, which we do with our product roadmap software, is that because you are continually tracking everything in the cloud, you can view and analyze an incredible amount of detail about how your customers are interacting with your product. Even though we don’t have access to our customer’s roadmaps for security and privacy reasons, we are aware, for example, of how many product managers using our software to share their roadmaps with others across their organizations.\nThis helps us to determine whether our tool is encouraging communication across the company and whether there are things we need to do to make the process easier or more intuitive for our customers. And if there is a common point in the roadmap development process where customers tend to reduce their interaction with our product, that gives a signal that we might need to revisit that part of the user experience and streamline or refine it.\nWhere to Find Useful Metrics for Your Roadmap Before You Have a Product\nThe examples of metrics that I listed above work well when you already have a product out there, generating data that you can track. But what if you don’t yet have a product on the market? What if you are in the strategy stage, just preparing to build your product? Where can you look for the metrics that will inform your strategic decisions? Here are three useful sources of information:\nExperts in Your Industry\nThese could include industry experts, or the widely read columnists and commentators who write and speak about trends in your industry and review your competitors’ products.\nIndustry Analysts\nThe researchers who cover your industry are an excellent source of information about which metrics offer the most significant clues as to what will constitute a successful product. These are the people, after all, who spend their days listening to briefings from your competitors about the things they’re finding resonate with their customers, and who then write detailed reports about which products are enjoying the most success in your industry, and why.\nYour Competitors\nUnless you’re planning to create an entirely new category with your product, chances are you have competitors with products already on the market. And chances are those competitors have done a lot of the research into the most strategically useful metrics relating to their products and their customers, and may have public information available, especially if they are a publicly-traded company. You can leverage this information in developing your own set of metrics to focus on.\nYou can find your competitors’ discussions of what they deem important data points in their press releases, on their earnings call with analysts (assuming they’re publicly traded) and even in their own business filings online.\nDownload Product Success Metrics  ➜\nHow to Communicate Your Metrics-Driven Strategic Goals\nTo this point, I’ve been discussing the importance of using a small set of key metrics as a way to help you shape your product strategy.\nBut another important reason to track and analyze these metrics — equally important in helping you successfully bring your product to market — is that they will give you a set of concrete evidence to share with your executive stakeholders over time, to help them understand and support your strategic decisions for your product.\nOne of the most effective ways to communicate your product strategy with your stakeholders, and to share with them the evidence that supports your strategy, is with a visual, intuitive product roadmap.\nAs you can see from the screenshot below, depicting a roadmap developed using ProductPlan, when you use the right roadmapping tool you can visually articulate your product’s strategic goals and then build into the roadmap the data points that support your decision to pursue each of those goals.\nConclusion: The 6 Steps to Data-Driven Roadmaps\nSo, to recap, my advice would be to always build your product strategy, and to develop your roadmap, based on key metrics that support your strategic decisions. And to accomplish this I suggest the following steps:\n1. First, establish your product’s strategic goals. (You can always adjust these goals in light of the evidence you’ll be gathering.)\n2. Next, make a list of possible strategically advantageous and illuminating data points to track — such as customer-oriented metrics like product usage, and business-focused metrics like customer acquisition cost.\n3. If you don’t have a product already on the market (or even if you do), you might also want to research your industry for strategically important metrics to focus on. To find these metrics, check in on what your industry’s luminaries, media, analysts, and competitors are focused on.\n4. Now it’s time to limit your metrics to a handful or so that you determine will give you the most strategic insights for the time and energy you’ll invest in tracking and analyzing them. (Too many data points can lead to confusion and can dilute whatever strategic insights you might uncover.)\nTweet This:\n“Tie metrics to strategic goals, and if the data shows you need to adjust your strategy, do it.”\n5. Next, tie these metrics to specific strategic goals you established in step 1. (And if your data points lead you to adjust your strategy, now is the time to do that.)\n6. Now you can build this strategy (including the data points supporting it) into your product roadmap, which you can then share with your executive stakeholders — demonstrating to them that you’ve brought evidence, and not just your intuition, to these strategic decisions.\nAt the point, I’d typically wish you luck with your product’s success. But now you’ve got evidence backing your strategy — so you won’t need luck.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/data-driven-product-roadmaps-metrics/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925784422,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Define Your Own Product Management Career Path","text":"\n Many companies provide a single career path up the proverbial corporate ladder where the only way to get ahead is by moving up in the title, rung by rung. In product management, this usually takes the form of something like this:\nFor most of my career, I worked at startups that had single-track product management career paths like this. Luckily, most of these companies were small enough that I was able to manage small teams while being hands-on, defining products, and collaborating with designers and engineers to bring those products to life. On two different occasions, though, I was faced with choosing between being a manager or an individual contributor (often referred to as an IC). Both took place at different times in my career, so depending on what stage you are at, my hope is that you find my experience useful.\nFrom Individual Contributor to Director of Product➜\nSpinner\nI joined Spinner, the world’s first streaming music service, in 1998 as one of a dozen or so employees. This was my first job as a product manager, and I was thrilled to have finally made the transition from marketing to product management. We were a small but mighty team that grew the business and the company rapidly. Within a year, we had grown to over one hundred employees. I managed a team of product managers, designers, and front-end developers. It was an exciting time leading a collaborative team, as we created numerous versions of our music player that was branded for a variety of partnerships.\nAOL\nIn 1999, American Online acquired the company. As part of the transition process, AOL brought in a few executives whose job was to evaluate their newly acquired staff in an attempt to integrate Spinner into their organization. I vividly remember the day I was called into a conference room with one of these individuals who asked a few questions about my role and responsibilities. At one point, she said, “Ah, you see, at AOL, you’re either an IC or a people manager. You can’t be both. You have to choose.” I felt like I was in the movie The Matrix, choosing between the red pill or the blue pill. I knew once I made my decision, there would be no turning back.\nBased on what I had seen so far of the AOL culture, I did not think I was cut out for the politics that seemed to dominate daily corporate life. Although I loved finding and hiring talented people to join my team, the work I enjoyed the most was creating something from scratch. Creating a vision, solving problems, and building products that people loved—is what drove me each and every day. I chose to give up my reins as a manager and spent the remainder of my career at AOL as an individual contributor. Looking back, I think the decision was easy because I was fairly new to product management at that time. Frankly, I wasn’t sure what the career path of a product manager even looked like back then. What I did know is that I wanted to have a direct impact on products that would be used by millions of people.\nMusicmatch\nI was eventually recruited away from AOL to join another music start-up called Musicmatch. Musicmatch was another pioneer in the digital music space with its CD ripping and burning software called the Musicmatch Jukebox. Similar to my experience at Spinner, I managed a small team while being hands-on with the product development process. One of the highlights from there was creating an in-house usability testing facility and hiring a UX researcher to help us better understand how customers were using our products and how we could make them better.\nSonos\nShortly after leaving Musicmatch, I was asked to join another digital music start-up called Sonos. When I joined in 2005, I was the only software product manager. The team at Sonos sought me out because of my experience with streaming music services. I had a strong network built from my days at Spinner/AOL and was able to leverage those relationships to establish new partnerships for Sonos. I also had experience developing software for hardware, which was an uncommon thing back then, before there were smartphones and IoT products. I jumped right in, wearing a number of hats. One moment I would wear a business development hat, negotiating with Pandora. Another minute, I would be working with a designer, sketching design ideas for our remote control software. The minute after that, I would be working with our acoustics team to figure out how we could tweak the EQ settings of our speakers to deliver the optimum sound quality.\nWhen I look back on those days, I’m honestly not sure how I did it all, but I loved every minute of it. At some point, however, it became clear that I was spreading myself too thin, and we needed to expand the team. To organize the work, my boss and I decided to split music service integrations into its own workstream. I hired and managed two additional people—one who would be responsible for the music service partnerships and the other who would be responsible for our 3rd party developer APIs and website. In addition to managing those new employees, I was the hands-on product manager for all other aspects of Sonos software. Again, I reached a breaking point where I was not being the best manager I could be to my staff, nor was I doing my best work as the PM for the Sonos software. I remember the CEO of Sonos telling me that one of the worst possible outcomes in promoting a great software engineer to being a manager is that you gain a mediocre manager and lose a talented engineer. The same could be said for product managers. My boss was extremely supportive and gave me a few weeks to do some much-needed soul searching to figure out what the best path forward would be for me.\nTweet This:\n“I remember the CEO of Sonos telling me that one of the worst possible outcomes in promoting a great software engineer to being a manager is that you gain a mediocre manager and lose a talented engineer.”\nI am a deeply introspective person, to begin with. Having the time and space to reflect on where I was at this particular stage of my career was such good fortune. I figured out the right path to take by asking myself one simple question:\nWhat are you working on that gets you out of bed?\nLooking back, I realized that I was focusing my energy on redesigning our apps and defining new features. Thinking about our customer needs, collaborating with designers and engineers, and launching new products—these were the things that got me out of bed in the morning. At the same time, I was not spending enough time filling the open positions on my team. I would block out a few hours each week for phone screens and the occasional interview and then wonder why it was taking months to fill the position.\nRead the Career Guide for Product Managers ➜\nAgain, I was faced with choosing between management and individual contribution. Even though I had made this decision once before, this time it wasn’t as easy. For one thing, Sonos didn’t have a 2-track career path for product managers at the time. They did offer a dual-career path for engineers, however. Another reason this was a difficult decision was my ego. At this point in my career, I had worked as a product manager for more than ten years and had some preconceived notions about my future that were based on the continuous climb up that invisible ladder. For me, this had less to do with power and more to do with money. The loftier the title, the higher the compensation.\nUltimately, I knew that money wouldn’t make me happy. What made me happy was thinking, “How can I help people listen to more music every day?” Deciding to be an individual contributor (again!) was the best decision for me because I was happiest having the most direct impact on the product. It was also the best decision for the company because they didn’t have to worry about further developing my management skills and, instead, they could unleash me on special projects, such as creating a ground-breaking retail experience for the flagship Sonos store in New York City.\nAs Shakespeare wrote, “To thine own self be true.”\nIn order to know which path you should take, you need to be honest with yourself. Set aside a few days for some deep introspection. Grab a journal and a pen and ask yourself these three key questions:\n1) What are your strengths as well as your blind spots?\nBe open to the feedback you’ve been given, the good and the bad. Take a co-worker out for coffee and ask them for feedback. Review those performance reviews again. If you already manage people, provide them with a way to give feedback.\n2) What do you enjoy doing the most?\nAsk yourself what gets you out of bed every day. Is it thinking about how to help your newest team member grow? Or do you thrive when brainstorming ideas for helping your customers use your product more easily?\n3) Where do you want to be in 5 years? 10 years?\nDo you have dreams of becoming a CEO or starting your own company? If so, the manager track might be best for you. Perhaps you’d rather be a subject matter expert in a particular field, speaking at conferences and being sought after for your brilliant insights.\nWhether you decide to focus on managing or would rather be an individual contributor, I encourage you to champion a dual-track path at your company if it doesn’t already offer it.\nHere’s what dual-track paths might look like based on my experience:\nHaving a track that rewards senior individual contributors helps retain a critical aspect of your company’s brain trust while ensuring people becoming managers are doing so because they want to.\nIn my particular case, Sonos did eventually develop a dual-track path for product managers, and I was the archetype for the Principal Product Manager role. It was gratifying to be recognized and rewarded for my contributions as the most senior product manager at the company in terms of tenure and experience.\nAfter leaving Sonos, I decided to pursue yet another career path by leveraging my extensive experience to start a consulting business. Being my own boss while having a direct impact on the success of my business offers me the best of both worlds.\nDoes your company offer different tracks for product managers? Have you ever faced the challenge of deciding if becoming a manager is right for you? What do you think?\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-management-career/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925710114,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Embracing the Power of AI and ML","text":"\n Few advancements have sparked as much excitement and potential as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These groundbreaking technologies are reshaping industries and revolutionizing the way we approach product management. As companies continue to integrate the capabilities of AI and ML into their software, they are reaping substantial rewards. Consequently, how will AI and ML transform the product management space?

We know the saying, but more than that, we live the saying. ProductPlan has consistently seen changes over the past 12 months, and our very own product roadmap has been a part of that journey. We’ve seen a little bit of everything, and the customer-facing roadmap has been critical during these changes.\nAs annual planning took shape, it became clear the 2022 customer-facing roadmap needed to evolve. Our audience has expectations and we need to meet them (if not exceed them). “Why” and “how” are the main questions we want to cover in the roadmap’s pivot to its current iteration.\nFive questions to answer\nFor this exercise, we go all the way back to square one. It’s almost (almost) as if the 2022 roadmap doesn’t exist. Thankfully, we have it as a baseline! The product team began by conducting a few internal and customer interviews to gather feedback on the 2022 roadmap. We wanted to know what worked and what could be improved. As we chatted with our respective audiences, the team came up with a framework for how to evolve the roadmap.\nAs shaping continued, the product team revisited the five questions to keep in mind before roadmapping. The first one to discuss focuses on the roadmap’s intended audience.\nAs we keep these questions in mind, we’re also going to look at this evolution through the lens of ProductPlan features. The overall taxonomy of the roadmap informs and complements these questions. With that said, we’ll focus on lanes, legend, tags and even custom views. When I write the 2024 version of this article, I have a feeling custom dropdown fields will play a major role. Stay tuned until then!\nWho is our intended audience?\nLet’s start with the intended audience for the 2023 roadmap. Who was this in 2022, and has it changed for the year ahead? These roadmaps have both primary and secondary audiences. Starting with an external need for our customers and then looking to the internal ProductPlan team, the roadmap must provide value for people with varying degrees of product familiarity. While there might be new members of the ProductPlan team and new customers, the overall audience remained consistent from 2022 to 2023. Ultimately, this is a customer-facing product roadmap. The secondary use would come for the product team as we organize our workload and present to the internal ProductPlan community.\nWith the primary audience, the lanes and legend saw an evolution from 2022 to 2023. We’ll dig into this soon.\nHow will we be sharing our roadmap?\nNow that we know the audience, how will the roadmaps be shared with these groups? When it comes to the externally-shared roadmap, we exclusively share via video calls. As much as we want the roadmap to speak for itself, we still need to ensure the ProductPlan team is able to share context as to what’s being worked on and any changes ahead.\nAs for the secondary audience, reviewing the roadmap has become more ad hoc for the internal ProductPlan team. Meetings are less frequent as we’ve found ways to better document necessary information. Everyone in the company has viewer access, but only the product team has editor access. In monthly roadmap update meetings, the product team presents product updates via the roadmap. These are less frequent than in past years. In addition to the monthly cadence, videos are shared on a more ongoing basis (thanks Vimeo integration)!\nI review the roadmap at the end of every week. This gives me the ability to track what’s currently being worked on and coming soon. I know things will change as the team and roadmap are dynamic!\nWhat are we trying to communicate and answer with the roadmap?\nHaving defined the audience for the year ahead, we then focus on what the roadmap is meant to communicate (and consider whether this changed over the past year)? While the actual features on the roadmap may have changed from 2022 to 2023, the way they are communicated has remained fairly consistent. As the audience for the roadmap, we are presented with a list view by tag. Those tags are “Recently Launched,” “Now,” “Next” and “Future.” This custom view gives us (the audience) a streamlined, simple draft that’s easy to understand. It reduces any extra noise and communicates the broad plan without getting too specific with dates and intricacies.\nContinuing along this path, what questions do we want the roadmap to answer for the audience? The roadmap remains a high-level, strategic tool. The audience doesn’t need to know exactly how the sausage is made. We just want to know why and when the sausage is going to be delivered! The use of containers became necessary in 2023 as more development and overall work was scheduled to occur. The product team grew and thus the workload expanded. There were more intricacies to manage. The team began employing both bars and containers rather than simply containers as was the practice in 2022.\nHierarchy of the customer-facing roadmap\nThe lanes and legend are the two most important elements of the roadmap. Ideally the legend will answer the audience’s most pressing question. Both the 2022 and 2023 roadmaps have ProductPlan objectives at their core, but there’s an evolution to these objectives. For 2022, the objectives focused more on product development and features. We saw the 2023 evolution take on broader brushstrokes. The prior was focused on Launch Management while early 2023 has seen a focus on Idea and Opportunity Management. Major projects related to integrations and new modules take centerstage.  Of course, roadmaps are dynamic and we know this will continue to evolve. Sharing it with customers has been a beneficial way to get feedback and influence that evolution!\nLanes underwent a similar transformation. The 2022 lanes were centered on ProductPlan competencies with the core product, integrations and platform enhancements. As planning was underway, the addition of new product managers meant more content on the roadmap. Lanes were going to be more important than ever.\nIt’s important to note that our customer-facing “roadmap” is a Portfolio made up of each product manager’s roadmap. Their underlying roadmaps are represented as lanes in the Portfolio. This makes it easy for each PM to edit, but also get a consolidated view. It also added an extra layer of organization as we planned for resources and development. Does each product manager have the same workload and resources? The 2023 roadmap gives a better answer to these questions.\nThe 2023 roadmap also saw the addition of more tags. The only tags for 2022 provided the Kanban style view. The tags for 2023 give us more about departments, company goals and product stages. We’re able to drill down into specifics and what each audience member (internal and external) truly wants to see.\nHow far out are we planning?\nFinally, we ask ourselves how far out are we planning? The roadmap remains consistent with the now, next and future presentation. We know the current quarter has around 80 percent accuracy. As we move further out to the future status, we’re aware the roadmap is going to lose a bit of that specificity and integrity.\nThe way our product team releases their work also changed from 2022 to 2023. In 2022, we released on a two week sprint cycle. That evolved to weekly sprints in early 2023 and now dynamic, potentially daily releases. We’ll see if that brings any additional updates to the roadmap!\nStay tuned for whatever changes occur next…we know they’re coming!\nIf you want to take a look at the 2023 roadmap with your customer success manager, please reach out, and we can get that scheduled. We’re also hosting an office hour to chat about the roadmap evolution and answer any questions you may have.

As I experienced the whirlwind of onboarding and meeting my wonderful colleagues, I also spent much time thinking about the future of product management and the space at large.\nWe have seen the rise of product operations, the Great Resignation, a renewed focus on digital transformation, and challenging economic uncertainty.\nHowever, throughout this period of monumental change, the product community continued to advance the field with shared knowledge and support, which allowed us to become more connected, even while many of us were still remote.\nPart of our mission at ProductPlan is to support the product community with insightful, data-packed content that provides actionable insights and serves as a valuable resource for product leaders and teams alike. So, I am honored to share some highlights from The 2023 State of Product Management Report.\nHow the state of product management report works\nOur eighth annual report explores significant trends and data-packed findings on the state of our industry. We surveyed over 1,500 product professionals last October. Our largest cohorts of respondents were “product managers,” “product owners,” and “directors of product.”\nA majority of respondents, 34 percent, had between 2-5 years of experience, with 33 percent reporting that they worked at an organization of 101-1,000 employees. Furthermore, most respondents reported working in “information technology and services,” while “computer software” came in at a close second.\nThis year’s report focuses on how product teams support the entire product lifecycle from ideation to launch. These findings fill me with excitement about the future of product management and the multitude of possibilities to push our field forward.\nKeep reading to learn key takeaways from the report and how it will impact product management organizations in the year ahead.\nCross-functional alignment is one of product management’s most significant challenges for 2023\nAcross various industries, product leaders often need help aligning their product strategy with organizational goals. Usually, this is the result of communication breakdowns amongst various stakeholders.\nAccording to our 2023 State of Product Management Report, 37 percent of those surveyed reported that “getting cross-functional alignment on product direction” was their biggest challenge.\nStruggling to get stakeholders on the same page is nothing new, but it becomes more challenging as companies look to scale. Ineffective communication can have devastating effects, including lackluster product launches and breaking trust among product teams and executive stakeholders. One way to look at this is as an opportunity to establish better communication strategies with all departments—executive leadership, customer success, marketing, and sales. Influential product leaders engage stakeholders and ensure conversations remain productive and informative.\nBest practice: use a product roadmap as a single source of truth for communicating with stakeholders\nA product roadmap is ideal for capturing important initiatives that product managers can share with stakeholders throughout the product lifecycle. The right roadmapping software can provide product teams with the ability to communicate roadmap changes to stakeholders, allowing them to understand changes to the roadmap at different points in time.\nA quick look back at the challenges product organizations faced has changed since 2022\nAs we look ahead to the new year, we must reflect on how product management trends have changed. According to our 2022 State of Product Management Report, 22 percent of respondents reported that “planning and prioritizing initiatives” was their most significant challenge. This challenge is likely the result of organizations readjusting after weathering the worst of the pandemic. We also found that 37 percent of respondents reported that they would allocate a significant portion of their budget to hiring product managers.\nTightening budgets requires product organizations to scale more efficiently\nWhen looking at budgets for 2023 and comparing them to our 2022 report, hiring remains the primary bucket for budget allocation at 22 percent. Despite recent layoffs and the Great Resignation, the product management field continues its upward trajectory regarding new hires.\nIn fact, according to Linkedin, 43 percent of organizations surveyed reported the need to hire more product managers.\nThough hiring was top-of-mind for our respondents, budget allocation to “change management initiatives” came in at a close second at 20 percent. Product leaders know that to execute change management effectively, they must first gain alignment amongst their team and stakeholders.\nBest practice: The seven R’s of change management\nSuccessful change management requires significant planning, strategy, and communication with all key stakeholders. To start, product leaders must focus on understanding the seven R’s of change management:\nThe REASON for the change\nThe RISKS of changing\nThe RESOURCES required to implement the change\nWho RAISED the change request\nWhat RETURN is necessary for the transition to be considered a success\nThe parties RESPONSIBLE for each aspect of the change\nThe RELATIONSHIP between this particular change and other recent, concurrent, or future changes\nProduct teams are focusing on using product metrics to measure success in addition to business metrics\nEach product team is uniquely positioned to identify how to measure product success. According to our report, 33 percent of respondents concluded that their team’s primary success metric was product metrics.\nLast year, our report ascertained that product managers who used “product metrics” as their primary success metric said that product experience had the most significant impact on customer acquisition.\nAdditionally, 32 percent of respondents reported that “business metrics” defined how they measured success.\nBest practice: product metrics inform the success of the product vision\nWhen done correctly, product and business metrics can work together to help product teams understand where they are at accomplishing the product vision. In essence, the product vision serves as a north star that helps the ever-evolving product strategy and tactics remain focused. Everything the product team accomplishes aligns with the product strategy and using the product and business-oriented metrics can inform teams of their impact.\nDespite the challenges ahead, the future looks bright for product management\nWhen product teams align their product strategy with organizational goals, the value they provide their customer grows exponentially. Moreover, when product teams own the product lifecycle, product market success tends to follow, which challenges the efficacy of the top-down approach.\nI look forward to you reading our 2023 State of Product Management Report. My colleagues and I hope you and your product team benefit from the many insights found within the report.\nFeel free to share with your colleagues and friends!\nDownload Our 2023 Product Management Report➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/future-product-management/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925783592,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Four Steps to Creating a Strategy-Based Team Roadmap: Why Starting with Vision Matters","text":"\n In my 12 years as a software product manager for Sonos, I benefited from an established company vision and strategy-based team roadmap. As a result, we created innovative and highly successful products. The Sonos vision, which has stood the test of time, is straightforward: to fill every home with music. From there, my fellow product managers and I developed a set of product strategies that allowed us to identify the products and initiatives that would translate to an executable product team roadmap.\nWhat is a Strategy Roadmap?\nBefore diving in, I thought I’d quickly align on what I mean by “strategy-based roadmap”. This particular roadmap serves as the link between the product strategy and the execution plan. The main content on this roadmap is the key outcomes and the timing around their delivery. A strategy roadmap expands on the “why” around upcoming product changes in order to achieve the strategic vision. I’ll explain how to convey these outcomes on your roadmap further in this blog.\nMy Experiences With a Strategy-Based Team Roadmap\nA vision statement illustrates why the company exists. From the vision statement, product managers can derive specific strategies that cover different areas of the product. For example, at Sonos, one of our product strategies was focused specifically on apps, and we used it to help determine which platforms to support. Keep in mind this was before the days of iOS and Android.\nIt was a strategy that served us well for many years; however, after the emergence of smartphones, we floundered a bit because that strategy no longer helped us effectively prioritize our customers’ problems. Therefore, it was incumbent upon us to replace that outdated strategy with something that would serve us for the next few years. This is no small feat, by the way. (If you need help defining or redefining your strategy, I highly recommend using Matthew May’s Playing-to-Win framework as a starting point.)\nTweet This:\n“Grounding your roadmap in strategy can help you grow your team by showing the value each person can add.”\nTo better illustrate how Sonos’ roadmap was guided by strategy, we structured our roadmap based on its strategies. This allowed us to tell a compelling story about the roadmap that was clearly tied to the company vision and resonated more easily with our stakeholders.\nStrategy Based Roadmaps as the Lone Software Product Manager\nWhen I first joined Sonos, I was the only software product manager, and I was responsible for the entire software roadmap. I managed everything from the software running on the speakers to the apps that controlled the music to securing music partnerships and leading them through API implementations.\nOver time, we grew the team and decided to hire product managers specializing in specific areas, such as music partnerships. Because we grounded our roadmap based on our product strategies, it was easy to show the value that each new hire would bring to the team. In addition, they would be responsible for a dedicated set of initiatives within our roadmap.\nRead the Strategic Roadmap Planning Guide ➜\n4 Steps to Creating a Strategy-Based Team Roadmap\n1. Lead with your vision and strategies.\nHave you ever seen a group of tourists following a tour guide waving a brightly colored flag? As a product manager, you need to be like that guide. It’s your job to make sure a) everyone following you know the right direction and b) that you’re all moving together as a team.\nLearn more about developing and communicating your product strategy in this ProductPlan webinar:\nIn every presentation you give, don’t even show a glimpse of your strategy-based roadmap until you’ve reminded everyone of your company’s vision and product strategies. Yes, this may seem very repetitive, but if you work at a growing company, for example, you need to use these meetings to educate everyone about why you are here. But, again, this is crucial for making sure everyone is moving in the same direction.\n2. Tell your story thematically.\nLet’s use an imaginary example and pretend we work at a company that is creating the next generation of car stereos connected to the internet. The company’s vision is “Enjoy your favorite music, everywhere you go.” To achieve this ultimate result, we’ve come up with the following product strategies:\n“Enjoy easy access to all streaming audio services.”\n“Superior sound quality”\n“Smart displays for a better experience”\nAs you contemplate how to create your roadmap, remember that it should not be a long list of product features. Instead, the roadmap should be high-level, and it should help you tell your product’s story.\nConsider breaking the phases of your strategy roadmap into themes. As ProductPlan co-founder Jim Semick explains,\n“…by grouping initiatives together into themes, you can organize your roadmap in a way that describes the value to customers and other stakeholders. In addition, themes can help you put together a roadmap that creates a story–the why behind what you’re proposing.”\nThemes also allow you to present what your team will deliver. This could enable your marketing team, for example, to plan their stories for driving customer acquisition and user retention.\nHave you ever had a conversation with your counterpart in product marketing about some shiny new object your team is building, only to see their eyes start to glaze over as they try to understand why what you’re describing will matter to your customers? Socializing your roadmap based on themes allows your stakeholders to quickly understand the value your team (and company) will deliver. Boil your strategies down to their very essence to create a set of themes.\nTweet This:\n“Boil your strategies down to their very essence to create a set of themes.”\nIn our example, this could look something like this:\nTips for Creating Themes:\nLimit the number of themes you have. Two is probably too few; seven is probably too many. Keeping it simple and concise allows you to capture what really matters and focus on the higher-level goals. Details such as mock-ups belong in your backlog.\nInvolve stakeholders in the process. Of course, you should involve your stakeholders in the roadmapping process but start earlier by including them in the theme identification process. I recommend doing this by first identifying key parts of your product’s experience, such as set-up and onboarding. Include people from your customer success team, too. Often, they can help identify pain points that may otherwise be overlooked.\nThemes should be directly tied to clear outcomes. What are the KPIs you will measure? For example, if your company measures success based on a Net Promoter Score, can you tie one or more themes to that?\nBased on the themes and KPIs, you and your team can work together to identify the tactics. Your tactics could map to your team’s backlog.\nInclude a description of your themes to avoid any possible ambiguity. For example, the theme ‘Voice Control’ from above may mean different things to different people. Provide a brief description that helps your stakeholders understand what you mean.Download Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\n3. Focus on problems, not solutions.\nAnother easy trap to fall into, especially if your company is used to shiny object syndrome, is feature-based roadmaps that focus on the solution, not the problem. Here’s another example of why being a product manager at Sonos was so awesome: we clearly defined the role of the product manager as the one who defines what needs to be solved and why. Our UX team and our software developers were responsible for defining how those problems were solved. Together, we were able to create great products our customers love.\n4. For every strategy, a swim lane.\nContinuing with our example of smart car stereos, you could create a roadmap with each of the three strategies in its own row (or swim lane, as I like to call them). For example, it could look something like this:\nStrategy Based Roadmap Takeaways\nNow and then, a tour guide sees something of interest or encounters a roadblock and decides to change direction. One of your many responsibilities as a product manager is to lead teams through those moments of ambiguity and change. Although your company’s vision should be evergreen and serve as the anchor that holds everything together, your strategic roadmap needs to be a living document reflecting current conditions. Things change. Priorities will shift. It would help if you were out in front, leading the way.\nThemes that are strategically focused allow you to get buy-in from your stakeholders more effectively. Just remember, feature-specific roadmaps can get you into trouble by focusing on tactical solutions rather than strategically focused outcomes. So keep your eyes focused on the bigger, strategic picture, wave your flag proudly, and make sure everyone is following you on your path to success.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/strategy-based-roadmap/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925746176,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Gathering Feedback From Unengaged Customers, Featuring Brian Tan","text":"\n Customer feedback is the lifeblood of customer-centricity. It’s impossible to create and improve products without understanding customers’ experience, especially when customers have unengaged and do not provide feedback. Customers don’t buy or use your products, so they have an opportunity to tell you what they think of them. They’re using it because it helps them get their job done, makes their life easier, or brings them a little joy.\nWhile some customers may be quite vocal, sometimes customers aren’t engaged. Often customers are unwilling to jump on a call or participate in a user forum. But you can’t limit your feedback collection to the customers who are proactively offering it up. You want to avoid a heavily biased view due to the combination of effusive superfan and complaining detractors dominating the conversation.\nInstead, to gauge your user base’s temperature, you need to hear from a wide variety of users. That will take a little extra effort. However, a more representative sample will legitimize the feedback you receive. It will paint a truer picture of the user experience.\n3 Ways to Gather Feedback from Unengaged Customers\nDuring our “Supercharge Your Product Roadmap with Customer Feedback” webinar, Brian Tran, Director of Product Management at UserTesting, urged product managers to figure out why customers/users are less forthcoming with feedback. He also outlines his suggestions on how to get input from unengaged customers.\n1. Lean into the pain points when gathering feedback from unengaged customers.\nBrian Tran suggests leveraging tools that allow you to follow up with users immediately. Especially those who just had a bad experience and might be unengaged.\n“You can grab them at the point when they’re at their highest level of frustration,” Tran said. “And that’s actually the most valuable time when you want to talk to them and get their feedback.”\nIt’s not always pleasant, but the feedback from these unengaged customers is what you and your team need to hear. When users hit a wall and can’t complete a task, they are at high risk of abandoning your product or decreasing their usage. The wall they hit will provide reduced value in their eyes, which can also impact your ability to monetize the product down the line further.\nOffering up a channel for quick, instant feedback at these moments can offer many benefits for product teams. First, you’ll get a sense of which friction points are coming into play most often. These points give you ammunition to prioritize addressing those areas in upcoming product releases.\nSecond, you’ll get more information about what the specific issue is. Is it a technical problem? Poor communication or messaging? Faulty business logic or process?\nThird, you (and your customer support team) will have the opportunity to potentially “rescue” some of these users. You do this by coming to their aid and expressing empathy during their moments of frustration. Instead of finding out the hard way when they quit, and you’re stuck dealing with churn feedback instead.\nBe sure to keep these pain-point feedback collection exercises as brief and, well, painless as possible for the user. They’re already unhappy. A 12 question form isn’t likely to generate a high response rate, so try sticking to a brief, focused email template.\nFirst, ask one or two questions to categorize their issue. Then offer an opportunity for them to provide further details and vent if they’d like. You can always follow up later with a call, email, or survey to dive deeper into their concerns.\nRead the Customer Interview Tool Box ➜\n2. Create an incentive.\nWhenever you’re thinking about soliciting unengaged customer feedback, put yourself in their shoes. They already bought your product or downloaded it, or saw your ads. What’s in it for them to spend their precious time making your job easier?\nTran says the trick here is providing a good reason for unengaged customers to spend some of their time giving feedback. Most value rewards.\nWhether it’s cash, a gift card, an exclusive experience, or even a discount on your product if these folks are getting this “for free.” They’re more likely to give you the time than if you asked them nicely.\nHowever, it would help if you made it clear that even though you’re compensating them for their efforts, you still want them to be brutally honest with you regarding their product experience.\nTo avoid any “quid pro quo” scenarios, Tran emphasizes that how you frame things can make a massive difference in the accuracy and transparency of the responses you’ll receive. Be very upfront that you want to hear honest feedback, regardless of how unpleasant it might be.\nRemind them that your goal is to improve the product, not solicit compliments. If they tell you what’s problematic for them, there’s a better chance that they’ll have a superior experience themselves in the future. So, it’s in their best interests as well to take part and be truthful.\n3. Find alternative strategies for collecting feedback from unengaged customers feedback.\nWhen a customer isn’t open to participating in a feedback session despite the lure of a reward, it’s time to get creative. You can offer alternative feedback methods, such as surveys since they’re asynchronous.\nAnother tactic is inviting customers to participate in a customer advisory board. Participating in an advisory board will give them a sense of ownership and a stake in the process, far beyond a one-off call or meeting.\nYou can always leverage existing relationships the customer may already have with other folks at your company. Try to find which salespeople or account managers they’ve established a good rapport with and piggyback on those interactions.\nThis rapport could get you an “in” with a customer that has otherwise frozen you out. Alternatively, you could have the colleague they’re close to asking your questions on your behalf.\nPut It All to Work\nAfter all that effort to extract tidbits from unengaged customers, you certainly don’t want to let the feedback all go to waste. Ensure you’ve already set up a practical framework for capturing, organizing, and evaluating customer feedback and putting it to good use during this process.\nAdditionally, it’s always a huge plus to follow up with customers that offered up their opinions and experience and let them know when something they asked for or complained about has been addressed in the product. You can even recruit them to be a beta user if they’re so inclined. Make them more open to future feedback sessions and maybe even get them to provide it proactively.\nRead the Customer Interview Tool Box\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/unengaged-customers/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925732462,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Getting Real about Customer Delight: The Strategy of Emotional Outcomes","text":"\n It’s all the rage, and is often the reason we get out of the bed each day – we want to delight our customers in everything we do. I’d bet that at least 75% of those reading this post would say that “Customer Delight” is somewhere in the top 3 stated goals of their company for the year. So, each day, well-intended product teams across the globe rally behind delight as an outcome in their work, eagerly awaiting their customers’ reaction as a barometer for success.\nGetting Real about Customer Delight: The Strategy of Emotional Outcomes\nIn my experience, however, these teams frequently lack a shared definition of what “delight” looks like in the context of their current initiative. Missing this up-front alignment inevitably creates dissonance between individual team members and their subjective interpretation of the customer feedback. The result is a team often in disagreement around when the work is “good enough” to move on to the next thing. The truth is, however, it’s likely that delight isn’t the goal. Delight as an outcome for every single feature or customer touchpoint is not only unnecessary and can be prohibitively expensive, and it’s also pretty close to impossible.\nUnfortunately, the phrase “customer delight” has lost its potency, as evidence that its definition seems to vary depending on the work context. But, before we indoctrinate the phrase into the swirling no man’s land of synergistic business buzzwords, I propose we reclaim it to portray the deeply emotional response for which it was initially intended. Rather than seeking to delight your customers at every corner, save it as a strategic outcome for the moments that truly matter.\nThe Diluted Definition of Customer Delight\nOver 20 years ago, a business trend emerged suggesting that delighting customers was measurably more profitable than simply satisfying them. Foundationally, the idea breaks down these two important definitions:\n“Customer satisfaction is the process of achieving goals and consistently delivering the value you promised. \nCustomer delight, on the other hand, is the “wow” factor. It proves to the customer that you intimately understand their needs and can proactively anticipate ways to improve their situation.”\nBy definition, then, simply satisfying customers can have the same potential to deliver high value as delighting them does. But, for some reason, we don’t set goals around that outcome. Meeting expectations isn’t as alluring as exceeding them, and years of favoring words that foster inspiration and motivation among employees have eroded their meaning. And, trust me, words matter. Especially when it comes to setting clear goals that you want the intrinsically subjective humans in your business to align around. Add in the fact that we’re talking about emotions, which are difficult to measure, and you have a surefire recipe for misinterpretation and misalignment.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nDelighted by Relief\nFor example, I once worked with a team that was finally picking up essential iterations of a feature MVP after over a year of customers begging for the full functionality. Being a team highly motivated by customer delight, they released small iterations and monitored the beta group’s feedback closely as their measuring stick for understanding when they’d met the need. Within two weeks of the estimated 4-6 week project, praise started rolling in from the beta customers. Customers inundated the team with gratitude and excitement, and since evoking delight was their metric of success, there was talk that they had solved the customer pain and could move on ahead of schedule and budget.\nHere’s the thing, though: The customer pain around not having the additional functionality was so significant that many had to abandon using the original MVP (a lack of engagement that triggered the business reason for prioritizing the work). When they saw the improvements, they were genuinely delighted. But in this instance, their delight wasn’t at all due to exceeding their expectations; instead, it was their reaction to the feeling of relief. Providing this relief was the emotional equivalent of giving a small bottle of water to someone stranded on a deserted island. The smallest sip of water will surely delight them with temporary relief, but that alone won’t save their life.\nSo, in theory, we can delight our customers by merely starving them first. That’s not our goal and not suitable for business, but it demonstrates the ambiguity of setting goals for emotional outcomes without clarifying their meaning.\nAfter much discussion and deliberation, the team ultimately made the right call to keep working with customers on the iterations, and still finished ahead of schedule. Upon the full release, customers’ response didn’t delight as defined by “wowing” customers and exceeding their expectations. But simply satisfying their need made customers happy and saved several accounts that had threatened to churn. It was a massive win for both customers and the business.\nReturn on Innovation as a Deliberate Strategy for Emotional Outcomes\nAt the core of being misaligned on an emotional outcome such as delight is that emotions are personally subjective. Thankfully, there are some ways to help teams get aligned on these goals at the onset of a project and help them track progress against them over their work.\nIn his 2015 LinkedIn article, Geoffrey Moore introduced three categories for innovation efforts: To differentiate, neutralize, or optimize. It has since become a simple and effective lens for businesses to look through to make conscious decisions about where and how to invest focus. These innovation classifications are also a great way to align product development teams on the intended outcome of a new feature or improvement and how to determine when the work is good enough to move on.\n1. Delight to Differentiate\nFirst, to differentiate a product (or feature or service) means that customers get more value from it, then they could go anywhere else in the market. For product development teams, efforts intended to differentiate should far exceed any other solutions and require a high level of care and feeding to achieve that outcome. But differentiation isn’t just about checking more boxes than your competitor, instead of creating a response from customers that send them flocking to sign up and even pay extra for your solution. Differentiation is highly focused on the emotion, and in this case, we are truly talking about delight. This is the same psychology behind why people will buy a brand of food that’s twice as expensive as its competitor with the same ingredients or choose a bottle of wine based on the label’s design. It makes them feel good.\n2. Neutralize to Meet Expectations\nOften product development teams are tasked with building a solution to neutralize a competitive one. Almost all feature development motivated by sales objections fit into this category, and it’s important work! Wowing customers is not the goal of neutralization efforts. In fact, more often than not, customers (or prospects) are already wowed with the product but find themselves in a predicament where they might need to use a different solution because yours is lacking. In the case of the story I shared earlier, the work that team was doing fit clearly in this category in retrospect. The goal was to keep the product usable and at least up to par with competitive solutions, so aspiring to delight customers here wasn’t all that practical and would have been unnecessarily expensive (in terms of time invested). Neutralization efforts are best poised to satisfy your customers simply: Deliver the value they asked for and expect.\n3. Optimize to Improve Satisfaction\nFinally, Moore describes efforts that optimize as more internally focused – delivering the same value to customers more efficiently to save on costs. But providing the same value more efficiently is also a crucial customer-facing goal that product development teams can and should continuously prioritize. Looking at optimization from a value exchange perspective, many of these efforts are win-win for the company and the customer. From a customer’s emotional outcome perspective, I find this kind of work addresses functionality that was once exciting but has lost its luster, usability or performance over time. In these cases, the customers are less than satisfied, and the goal is to return them to equilibrium.\nMeasuring Emotion\nI know what you’re thinking, “that can’t be done!” But, while it’s true that emotion is a complex and personal experience, there are some ways that product teams can gauge, normalize, and track their work against the intended emotional outcome.\nThe most obvious metric is the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which asks customers how likely they are to recommend the product or service to a friend. Foundationally, NPS gets to the excitement a customer feels about your business and their drive to refer others to it. And, that’s right, excitement is an emotion. NPS is an excellent company-wide indicator of how customers feel about their business, but it does little to help teams hyper-focused on a specific solution. These teams can introduce a Transactional Net Promoter Score (tNPS) survey as part of the experience they are building that asks customers how likely they are to recommend the company based on this interaction.\nAnother useful metric is the Customer Effort Score (CES). Originating from the realm of customer service and focused on how easy or difficult it is for customers to resolve issues, the intent is also highly applicable to product development in terms of user experience. Making tasks effortless to complete in your product leaves customers feeling confident and in control. Some studies show that reducing and simplifying customer effort can have a stronger correlation to retention and loyalty than delight. Asking customers how easy or difficult it was to use the solution you built is a highly valuable approach to validating your work.\nFinally, measuring perceived value via the Product/Market fit question gets at the core of emotions by asking customers how they would feel if they had to stop using the product, from very disappointed to not at all disappointed. Like the examples above, teams can ask this question specifically about a feature or improvement to understand how well it meets their needs as part of their build, measure, and learn feedback loop.\nI’ve seen teams successfully adopt these models to set goals that align with the emotional outcome they want to achieve and implement one-question surveys to track against that. The goal you will set will depend on the purpose of the work. For neutralization efforts, for example, a high tNPS goal would certainly be overkill, but ensuring that at least 40% of customers would be very disappointed to stop using the feature might be a more reasonable gauge.\nCustomer Delight Still Matters!\nTo those businesses setting delight as a high-level goal for the year, I say that is still an important strategy! But, instead of encouraging employees to seek delight in all of their work, be more explicit about the touchpoints and interactions where it truly matters. As a gut check, ask yourself if customers would be excited about the goal’s bullet points. Or, better yet, ask them.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/customer-delight-strategy/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925770863,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Getting to Know Jim Semick","text":"\n I met Jim Semick the first day I started ProductPlan.

I’m okay with uncertainty. It’s who I am. I am okay with not knowing what the future holds. I haven’t always been that way, but that’s who I am today. I can take reasonable risks, which makes it possible to launch new products or a startup.  I like to have fun too — Why bother if it’s not fun?\nThroughout my career, it’s been imperative for me to pursue my curiosities and challenge myself. I want to learn—whether it’s entrepreneurship, life, or even studying Roman antiquities. With each piece I collect, I’m curious to know everything about it. Where did it come from? What are the stories that came with it?\nWhat do you enjoy sharing with the product community?\nI believe that great products don’t happen by accident—it’s exceptional leadership and customer engagement that genuinely makes a difference. As such, I’m passionate about sharing my experience with future product leaders to build successful products that solve real customer problems.\nThere are quite a few topics I’ve explored over the years. It started with my top passions of market validation and product-market fit. When I’m talking with customers, I’m driven to understand what problem we’re solving and figuring out all the levers that startups can experiment with to make a successful product. I’ve conducted hundreds of validation interviews with customers and prospects for different software products I’ve helped launch—I love sharing some of the techniques I’ve learned about conducting great customer interviews.\nDownload the Product-Market Fit Book ➜\nValidation of products, customers, and markets is a skill that not many product managers and entrepreneurs know much about. It’s frustrating to see new startups and products fail. I know that failure is sometimes necessary but often avoidable. The risks that teams take without doing the validation breaks my heart. You could pinpoint the start of the failure to not understanding the customer’s problem or misinterpreting the customer’s need. That frustration a few years ago inspired me to start writing and speaking on the topic at conferences and lecturing in various programs at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nThe Feature-Less Roadmap: Using Themes and North Stars to Ground Your Product Roadmap\nIf I can help in some way to improve a company’s success in some way—I want to. Lately, I’ve been writing and speaking a lot about essentialist product management, entrepreneurship, and building winning software products.\nIn the last few years, I’ve also written books on SaaS pricing, product roadmaps, and product leadership.\nThey’re available to read here:\nThe Power of Pricing Experiments\nProduct Roadmaps: Planning Your Strategy\nProduct Manager to Product Leader  I enjoy guest authoring for various publications and talking on numerous podcasts.\nIn addition to speaking, I also mentor and invest in my community in Santa Barbara, California. I love to travel, paddleboard, and read as much as I can.\nTell us a bit more about your career.\nSemick: For almost 20 years, I have taken new disruptive software products from concept to market launch. I’ve perfected a recipe for building and launching great products that have a greater chance of succeeding in the market.\nMy current company, ProductPlan, creates software used by thousands of product teams at the world’s leading companies to power their product roadmaps. I started ProductPlan as part of my entrepreneurial journey. With my co-founder Greg Goodman, we started the company with the end in mind and reverse-engineered the company to align with our objectives and values. I talk about this in the book Product-Market Fit.\nI’ve previously helped validate and launch some of the earliest SaaS products, including GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, and AppFolio.\nWhat can a reader expect from Jim Semick?\nSemick: Writing and sharing my message has flowed seamlessly from my passions. I write a lot about topics that mirror the stage and lifecycle that ProductPlan is in.\nI would talk about start-ups, lean-market validation launching, product discovery, and uncovering problems in the early days. That was my mindset. Then my talks evolved to be about product roadmaps. They then transformed into conversations on how we communicate. I’m always learning new product management things (product ops, product growth, decisions through metrics).\nYou can definitely expect to hear more about how product managers can use the philosophy of essentialism to focus on what matters and get more meaning from their work. I’ve spoken about essentialism for various product management groups and am conducting workshops.\nI owe it to the community to keep providing new ways to look at how we’ve been doing things.\nTakeaways\nJim is open to speaking engagements and connecting with product leaders on LinkedIn.

Getting to the minimum viable product is a balancing act—on one hand, you want to thoroughly validate against potential failure points, but on the other hand, you want to get to market quickly.\nFor years I’ve helped define and launch products that, in the beginning, were simply concepts. My goal with this post is not to write a rigid formula that probably won’t work for your unique company—I’ve never been interested in turning an art into a science. Instead, I’ll provide some guiding principles to help you feel comfortable taking the plunge. Here are the five most valuable lessons I’ve learned from launching new products.\nDownload the Anatomy of a Product Launch ➜\n1. When it comes to launching products, start before you’re ready.\nThe nature of building a new product or starting a new company is that you don’t have very much information on which to base decisions. Established products have the luxury of history; their product managers can analyze years of usage data or survey statistically significant pools of existing customers to help make decisions. New products, on the other hand, are a clean slate.\nBut that doesn’t give those of us building new products license to skimp on market validation. You still need to do the necessary work to get to your MVP. That is, you still need to talk to prospects and understand as much as you can about their workflows and pain points. You need to ask them how much (and if) they are willing to pay to solve the problem your product intends to solve. And you need to solicit feedback on prototypes and make changes accordingly.\nHowever, once you’re reasonably confident that your product provides value to your market, launch it.\nToo many entrepreneurs and product managers wait until their product is absolutely “perfect” before putting it in front of customers. Of course, you understandably want to impress the market with a robust feature set and a polished UI, but waiting until you reach “perfection” is a mistake.\nGetting your product in the hands of real users is precisely how you start building that knowledge base that established products benefit so much from. The more time you spend upfront building out features based on assumptions, the more time you take away from iterating on actual feedback and real-world user behavior.\nFor example:\nWhen we were validating ProductPlan, we uncovered the pain product managers were experiencing around communicating their roadmap. But rather than solving all the pain with our first release, we launched a product that solved just enough significant pain that customers were willing to pay for it. We’ve continued to enhance the product since that day, incrementally solving more pain with each release.\nHere are a few common mistakes people make when launching new products, and how they can be avoided by launching early:\nMisaligning with your market.\nIt’s often the case that the people you initially build your product for don’t end up as your core customers. Sometimes adjacent markets or personas are actually a better match. For example, perhaps you thought you were building an enterprise software product, but it turns out to resonate better among the mid-sized businesses. The good news is these types of mistakes are usually correctable, given you’re willing to fail fast and adjust course.\nExtrapolating from a small sample size. \nAnother common mistake happens when you interview a few people and assume their problems apply to the entire market. Small sample sizes distort data. What’s one way to open the spigot and allow more people to weigh in? Launch early!\nOverinterpreting positive reactions. \nGenerally, people don’t want to hurt your feelings. If you ask them what they think of your beautiful new product that you’ve spent months working on, they’re likely going to tell you it’s great. When you’re just collecting feedback and there’s no real business transaction at stake, it’s easy for people to overestimate how often they’ll use your product or how much they’re willing to pay for it. Launching can help you avoid these false positives and get to the truth faster.\n2. You don’t build products. You solve pain.\nPeople don’t buy products because they have X, Y, and Z features; they buy products to help them solve problems. Think about the products you use every day and the reasons why you use them. You probably wouldn’t say you value LinkedIn for its newsfeed algorithm or direct messaging feature. Instead, you’d say that it helps you find job opportunities or hire talented people.\nIn general, the benefits of using a product matter much more to customers than specific features and capabilities. Your job as someone launching a new product is not to build the best features, but to solve the most important problems. The best part is, if you’re able to effectively solve someone’s problem—whether that means alleviating a pain point in their workflow or helping them get home to their family on time—they’re likely going to forgive you if the product falls short in other areas. They’ll stick with you as you work out the initial kinks because the core value you’re providing is worth it.\nFor example:\nWhen I was part of the team validating the product that was to become GoToMeeting, we uncovered pain around the complexity and high variable cost of other online meeting solutions. We decided to launch a simpler product that was easier to budget. It wasn’t about more features. It was about simplifying the customer’s experience and reducing frustration.\nA lot of startups fail because they run out of money. The way to circumvent that trap is to focus on nailing the problem first. Invest in understanding the context in which your potential customers will use your product. What’s the most frustrating part of their day? What motivates them? What does it mean for them to have a good week/month/year? (Check out this list of 10 questions product managers should ask customers for additional interview ideas). Find a strong pain point that people are willing to pay to solve and pivot to building ancillary features only after you’ve started collecting your first payments.\n3. The whole experience is the product.\nAnother common mistake that product managers and entrepreneurs make is focusing solely on the application itself, instead of looking at the product holistically. A customer’s impression of your product is not confined to the time they spend in the app. The customer experience begins the moment they click on one of your ads or find their way to your marketing website, and it extends to the interactions they have with your support and sales teams.\nIt’s important to consider the customer journey as a whole, because if you’re always heads-down working on the application, you may miss out on some great wins in other areas. Every component of the customer journey represents an opportunity to innovate and stand out from your competitors. Differentiators don’t always have to be features; they can be a unique pricing model (as in the case of GoToMeeting), a speedy onboarding experience, or superior customer support.\nWhen you’re launching a new product, take time to understand the entire ecosystem surrounding it. There are probably strings you can pull to make the customer journey smoother and simpler. For example, how can you make it easier for people to find and buy your product? And what about the way you talk about your product in demos and on the marketing website? Are you clearly communicating the value proposition?\n4. You don’t know what you don’t know.\nOftentimes we avoid testing new ideas because we think we already have the answers. “That obviously won’t work,” we tell ourselves. Established companies are especially guilty of this. They have thousands of customers using a given product feature, so they think it must be a good feature. Or their current pricing model has brought in plenty of sales, so they’re convinced it’s the perfect pricing model. No need to test anything new, right?\nWrong. You don’t know what you don’t know, and your own assumptions can sometimes be your biggest barriers to success. An experimental approach can help you overcome blind spots and stay ahead the competition. New products and companies are uniquely positioned to approach problems with a beginner’s mindset. Be sure to capitalize on this advantage and experiment with lots of different approaches to figure out what works best.\nAnother problem with assumptions is that they often hold us back from doing any actual legwork. You may think that customers want feature X and not feature Y. Or you may believe that message A resonates more strongly with prospects than message B. But how sure are you really?\nDon’t be an armchair product manager. Get out of your building and interview potential customers. Or better yet, go observe their current processes and work environments. The truth about what will make your product successful is out in the world, not in your imagination.\nTweet This:\n“Don’t be an armchair product manager. Get out of your building and interview potential customers. Or better yet, go observe their current processes and work environments.”\n5. Start with the end in mind.\nBefore you get too deep in the trenches building a new product, it’s valuable to determine what you’d like to achieve. Just building the product and shipping it, or even gaining funding, is not a success in itself. Think about the type of business you want to be five or ten years down the line. How are you going to get there? This is the product vision.\nThe product vision is a long term view of where your product is headed. From there, you derive the goals for the product that aligns with the features that you’ll then be releasing.\nOnly after you have a solid feel for the potential customer’s problems is it possible to determine the solution and prioritize features. To help guide those decisions, it’s important to have a strong product vision — this is true even for existing products within an organization, but particularly for early-stage products.\nBy creating a high-level product vision, you can get the executive team, marketing, support, engineering, and the rest of the organization on board with the strategy. This will ultimately help you get buy-in on how you plan to prioritize features.Sit down with your team to discuss the vision for your product and get an agreement on the high-level metrics you’ll use to evaluate its performance and guide your future decisions.\nThis doesn’t mean you should define granular business and product metrics from the get-go—you’ll need some actual customer data before you can accurately forecast things like conversion rates, lifetime value, monthly active users, etc. But documenting general goals upfront will help your team stay aligned and motivated after you launch. Things are always changing in a growing business, and it’s important to be agile, but that doesn’t have to mean losing focus. Be sure you’re making changes with clear end goals in mind, and not just shooting in the dark.\nDo you have additional advice for launching new products?

John is a product coach with Amplitude, where he collaborates with internal teams, customers, prospects, and the broader product public.\nProduct teams are no stranger to the ever-changing and continuous demands of consumers and executives alike. When you create and update a particular product, it’s important to make sure the product does “things” that people need it to do. A list of available features holds obvious value to a customer—you can see in one quick bulleted view what the product has to offer and how it will fit your needs.\nBut are features truly the only beacon of light for high-impact product work? Do the constant feature requests (and the ongoing efforts to communicate progress on those requests) distract developers and product managers from being able to create a more sustainable and meaningful product?\nWe asked those questions, and more, in a recent interview with expert panelists Abbie Kouzmanoff, product manager for Amplitude, and Jim Semick, veteran product manager and one of the founders of ProductPlan.\nWhat are the pitfalls of focusing myopically on features while creating and communicating roadmaps? How do you avoid feature-fixation, and instead use themes and “north stars” as the guiding light for creating long-term value not only for customers but for product teams as well?\nFeatures and Inertia\nFeature-based roadmaps have long been the norm of product development, they put product managers in the hot seat to “deliver” the roadmap “to plan.” While in many ways it makes sense to first answer the question of “what are we building, and in what order?” the key is balancing that need against the upside of taking a less prescriptive approach.\nCertainty and surface-level predictability come at a cost. Once the team has converged on a specific feature—or set of features—it can be difficult to change course. We become less likely to respond to new information, and we don’t work in ways that elicit new information. We all have difficulty counteracting inertia, confirmation bias, and escalation of commitment.\nFor example, Jim shared a past experience where his team helped develop software in the property management industry that would help property managers move tenants into their apartments faster. They created a roadmap based on an idea about what they were going to build and all the features it would encompass. Unfortunately, they were overly optimistic and got stuck. It took a long time to deliver that first feature.\nWith this feature-based roadmap viewpoint, it was very hard to shift priorities along the way. Alternatively, Jim noted, “Had we created a theme-based roadmap, we could have delivered value to customers a whole lot faster. We could have learned faster. We could have introduced features more iteratively to our customers, and it might have re-prioritized what we did.”\nIt’s really important to be able to test the riskiest assumptions first before committing to specific features. Instead, Abbie recommends, it’s better to treat features as options and give yourself the time for iterative learning—testing out and learning what features will have the biggest impact and save time in the long run.\nThe end game is outcomes, rather than outputs. You might have an idea for a great feature to build, but that feature doesn’t necessarily create a business outcome or solve a customer problem. And in the end, as Abbie asserts, “[A feature-based roadmap] doesn’t set you up for really evaluating yourself once that feature has actually gotten out there.”\nSo what is the alternative?\nDownload Product Roadmaps: Planning Your Strategy➜\nProduct Themes and North Stars\nThemes and the North Star framework can be used by themselves or in tandem to address the traps above. Importantly, both can still be used even if your roadmap is currently feature-based. The key goal is coherence and shared understanding.\nThemes\nWith a theme, features connect to an overarching idea for that work. Themes are a great nudge to see the bigger picture, link to a particular strategy or companywide objective, and allow for stakeholder buy-in. You can create a theme-based roadmap in several ways. The important part is tying together your theme with certain features to illustrate the benefits.\nA theme does a couple of things.\nIt helps you earn stakeholder buy-in because—ideally—it is tied to the objectives of the company, in addition to the outcomes that you want to create for customers. Talk with your stakeholders about themes first and come to a consensus together. Then you can begin to plug your features into that theme.\nIt helps you stay strategically on track. Jim notes, “You’re going to get distracted. You’re going to get distracted by a loud customer. You’re going to get distracted by the next shiny object. Someone’s going to come to you with a fantastic idea, and that idea is often phrased in terms of a feature.” With a theme, you are less lured by flashy ideas because the feature inevitably requires alignment. That way, even if you get distracted by a fantastic idea, you can decide whether to put the effort into it if it doesn’t fall in line with the theme.”\nThink back to the property management feature-based roadmap example, had Jim and his team started with a theme, they would have created a more innovative product. “If our theme was about moving in renters 50% faster, we could have started to measure our progress against that. It’s a lesson that I learned along the way and one that I would encourage you to do.”\nDownload the Product Roadmap Strategy Workbook➜\nNorth Star Framework\nIn contrast, a North Star Framework represents your product strategy with a primary (North Star) metric and a series of inputs. Together, this “tree” of metrics serves as an effective way of capturing assumptions, beliefs, and known causal relationships between different components and subcomponents of a product strategy.\nFor example, Amplitude’s North Star, Weekly Learning Users (WLUs), has three inputs related to activating customers and encouraging users to create and share their insights. Each input is a key facet of their team-focused, learning-focused strategy.\nZeroing in on the right North Star metric can be a bit of a challenge. However, it forces you to ask hard questions related to your product strategy. How can you tell if you’re on the right track?\nHere are the key characteristics of an effective North Star, according to Abbie:\nIt focuses on customer value and the exchange of value. For example, daily active users (DAUs) don’t really tell you anything about the value that was exchanged.\nIt represents your unique product strategy. It is not generic.\nIt connects the customer value you are trying to create as a product team with the business impact that the executive team in your company ultimately cares about.\nOnce you have a strong North Star in place, it has an exponential impact on decision-making.\nWith WLUs as a guide and reminder, Abbie’s team was able to take a routine feature request (the ever-popular in B2B “Bulk Editing of Records”), and ask “How does this impact learning and WLUs?” By asking that question, they’re able to see past the surface request to understand the deeper impact on how teams create and share insights. Abbie explains, “It’s a tool to communicate and say, ‘Hey, we still want to solve this customer pain, but we all know that we’re working toward this metric. This alternative path will really get us to that metric faster.’”\nThemes & North Stars\nAt a high level, both Themes and North Star Frameworks are tools for alignment and sensemaking. They are complementary. A team might use the North Star Framework to create alignment around a product strategy, and then attach Themes to North Star “inputs.” Themes are flexible and can be used to describe any number of dimensions related to the work. The job you’re hiring both to do is very similar: inspire aligned autonomy, encourage the best solutions and decisions, and foster a shared language.\nDownload Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\nHow to Get Started\nWondering how to integrate themes and a framework like North Star Framework into your roadmapping process? Here’s where to start.\nHave lots of conversations, brainstorms, and “testing.” See if your proposed themes and/or North Star metric and inputs withstand extra scrutiny, like the “yeah buts” and “what ifs.” These tools will only be useful if people can actually use them, so they must be “usable,” even if that means a little less theoretically correct.\nBuy-in is one of the biggest hurdles to adopting a feature-less roadmap. Abbie and Jim recommend that your first goal be to establish themes alongside your entire team—not just the key product decision-makers. Get everyone from design to dev on board with your themes and see where the journey takes you!\nAbove all, keep the “why” in mind. Don’t remove features from a roadmap just to scratch a dogmatic itch. The reason you do this—along with Themes and North Stars—is to inspire better decisions. This, in turn, delivers more value to your customers and leaves your team happier and more proud of their work.\nCheck out the webinar to learn more about feature-less roadmapping.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nJohn Cutler shares more of his product leadership thoughts in Spotlights: John Semick “The most daring thing I’ve done is shut up and observed”, below.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/roadmap-themes-north-star/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925734364,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Help! I’ve Been Handed a Bad Product Strategy","text":"\n On our blog we often discuss the challenges of being a product manager. One recurring theme is that although you are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of your products, you often do not have organizational authority over anyone.\nIt’s a conundrum: Your job is to develop a consensus and execute your product’s strategic plan without the authority to tell anyone what to do. You need to bring together development, marketing, sales, and even your executives to make that plan a reality. This is why we frequently make the case that successful product management is largely a function of leadership — not management (at least in the sense of ordering and supervising). It’s also why my team here at ProductPlan has written several posts, like this one, about the need for product managers to learn how to think strategically, communicate persuasively, evangelize for their products, and develop other important soft skills.\nTweet This:\n“Product management is largely a function of leadership — not management.”\nBut what happens when the product management challenge you face is that you have poor strategic direction to begin with? \nIn other words, what if you’re simply handed an ever-changing strategy and given responsibility for turning it into a successful product? Worse, what if you know that the product strategy is flawed or poorly conceived?\nThis happens all too often. And it happened to a product manager who attended a recent webinar on thought leadership that I presented for Pragmatic Marketing. I’ve reproduced a portion of the message here. Then I’ll summarize the advice I gave him, because I think it could prove useful for you, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation.\nHi Jim,\nI have a question about working with a poor product strategy for a just launched product. Our ex-CXO developed the product strategy. Since his departure, the executive team doesn’t have the resources or energy to fix the problems he left, and I find it difficult to push out the releases and spend time on defining a new product strategy. Unsurprisingly, there has been weak adoption of the product by the market and few new users.\nHow do you deal with being handed a poor product strategy where the targeted customer segment isn’t clear, not enough time was spent learning about the potential users, and your executives don’t want to stop product development and do customer development in order to hone in on a specific segment, learn more about pain points and get super clear of value add?\nHow You Can Get Stuck with a Poor Product Strategy\nAs I told this attendee, this is an excellent question, because it summarizes so many of the challenges product managers and product owners face when their company’s ideas and assumptions don’t match reality.\nHere are the challenges — every one of them a common problem, facing many companies, particularly startups — that I spotted in his question.\nSoftware companies want to deliver new features.\nThis is understandable because it shows progress. It’s also an easy metric to focus on and can feel like an easy win. “Look! We’re releasing new features to the market!”\nThe more important question, though, is whether any of these new features will move the needle for the company in terms of user adoption, opening new markets, customer delight, and positive public reviews.\nExecutives work on assumptions — not always grounded in fact.\nAnother common product management challenge, clearly evident from this attendee’s message, is that often a startup’s executive team will be working off of their own assumptions about their market, their product, their competitors and their target customers.\nThis, too, is understandable. After all, the executives were responsible for getting the company off the ground, and as a result, they have probably developed a bias in favor of their own opinions.\nAt the attendee’s company, the previous product lead was clearly operating on his own assumptions. But as the product release revealed, he likely didn’t subject those assumptions to testing and verification before building them into his strategy.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nGrowing companies often feel the need to keep their developers busy.\nThe note in this message about the executive team not wanting to stop product development to focus on strategy highlights another common product management challenge. Often a management team or a company’s investor will equate a development team being busy — being “productive” — with the company making progress.\nAgain, that’s understandable from the standpoint that the company is paying for development resources, and the perception is that those resources will be sitting idle while the product team interviews customers, studies the market, and conducts other “fuzzy” tasks. It certainly isn’t as easy to measure as hammering out code.\nTweet This:\n“Focusing on strategy is far more valuable than just keeping the dev team busy.”\nBut as smart product owners like this attendee understand, focusing on strategy is far more valuable than keeping a development team busy on the wrong things.\nProduct owners can become information silos.\nOne final problem that this attendee’s message highlighted is that often a company’s product owner — whether a product manager, VP, or founder — can become the organization’s perceived source of knowledge about the product, market, competitive landscape, and customer personas.\nThis is obviously a danger. If the rest of the product team has little to no input in developing the product strategy, the departure of one key individual can leave the company struggling to figure out all of the learnings and input that went into building that strategy.\nThe good news, as I told this attendee, is that a product owner can indeed improve upon a flawed or poorly conceived product strategy. Here are the suggestions I offered to him.\nHow to Fix a Poor Product Strategy\n1. Assign a product owner (or team) to drive the strategy.\nOne key component to creating a viable product strategy is to assign a responsible person or team to the task. In other words, developing the product strategy needs to be a clearly defined role in the company.\nIf it becomes an informal, widely distributed task that everyone has a hand in crafting, your product strategy likely will be watered down.\nIdeally, this will be a product manager, as I suggested to the attendee. But it could also be another product owner or even a small dedicated group of product team members.\nFor more on developing your product strategy, watch our webinar:\n2. The product strategist must then bring evidence supporting these strategic initiatives.\nIf you want to improve a weak product strategy, you must first identify a few of the major strategic initiatives that will support your vision. These initiatives should emerge after working closely with customers (end-users, economic buyers at your customers’ organizations, etc.) to determine the problems they’re facing and how your product can solve those problems.\nFrom there, you will be able to present real evidence to your stakeholders that these strategic initiatives support solutions that your customers need and are willing to pay for.\nThis means shifting the focus of your efforts from developing more product features to performing customer development — getting out there and talking with a cross-section of your customers and potential customers. What I suggested to my attendee, and what I’d also invite your team to do, would be to spend time on the road visiting with customers to identify the ideal segment, and to settle on a few of the most compelling problems to solve for that segment.\nTweet This:\n“Handed a poor product strategy? Shift the focus back to customer development.”\nA related part of your research here, of course, would be to validate that your target customers would be willing to buy your solution if it were to solve these major problems for their companies.\n3. The product strategist should get company buy-in to shift focus temporarily from project management to crafting the new strategy.\nThrough customer development, you can prioritize your strategic initiatives. You can use a variety of methods to prioritize before developing your visual product roadmap. This roadmap will serve as your high-level blueprint for implementing your product strategy.\nYou and your team will need to step back temporarily from a focus on your backlog. Instead, you will need to focus on customer problems, describing how your product will help solve those problems and putting this into a strategic plan.\n[Free book] Backlog Refinement: How to Prioritize What Matters ➜\nAs part of this process, you will need to communicate this plan to your executive team to earn their buy-in.\nIf you work at a smaller company you might also need to offload some of your day-to-day project management responsibilities so that you can focus on strategy. This might be more challenging, and you might receive pushback.\nBut if you’re going to avoid the problem my attendee faced — releasing an unsuccessful product because you were forced to work from a poor strategy — it will be worth convincing your stakeholders to give you this strategy time. It will pay big dividends on release day and beyond.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nHave other ideas for handling a flawed product strategy?

That leads to some big bets based on incomplete information.\nSo, how can a product leader make sure they’re onboarding new hires with a good chance of success?\nCriteria for Hiring Product People During Each Stage of Interviewing\nHere are some ways I vet product management candidates to weed out poor fits and spot the diamonds in the rough.\nStage 1: Reviewing the applications\nA candidate’s resume will always tell you a lot about what they’ve done. But I’m just as interested in HOW they did it and their overall approach versus a long list of accomplishments. This starts with the language they use in their resume.\nHow did they participate in projects?\nDid they “run” a project or “collaborate” on it? Was the emphasis on completing something or its actual impact?\nJust like a product roadmap shouldn’t simply be a list of to-do items, I’m looking for outcomes and objectives in this context.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nAre they passionate?\nWhen hiring product team members I’m also looking for adjectives and verbs that convey patience, curiosity, and a humble style. I want a sense of the methods and tactics they employed to achieve those goals, not just that they ticked the box.\nHow do they measure success?\nSimilarly, the impact should be measured in more than dollars and cents. While it’s great that the product made a few million bucks, what I care about more is how many problems it solved. How many customers are satisfied because of specific decisions and actions made by the applicant? I’ll take a high Net Promoter Score over a short-term revenue spike any day of the week.\nAre they team players?\nI also want to hire team players. Look if their resume emphasizes all independent decisions made versus the processes they used to solicit feedback and garner stakeholder buy-in. If this is the case, it could be a sign they boss people around and don’t listen to opinions or leverage data-driven decision-making.\nDo they commit?\nOne red flag for me is frequent job-hopping. It can mean they didn’t care about their customers, weren’t performing well, and had to leave, or they didn’t do their homework ahead of time and signed on for something that wasn’t sustainable.\nWhile sometimes things don’t work out or a new opportunity springs up, you have to jump on it. If it’s a trend, then my “spidey sense” starts tingling. But it’s something I’m definitely going to dig into if they make it to the interviewing stage.\nStage 2: The phone screen\nBefore going through the hassle of bringing a candidate with a promising resume in for an in-person session, a phone screen can fill in many gaps. This opportunity can give you a better indication of whether they’re worth the time and energy.\nI want to be sure they have enough of the necessary skills on day one to add value quickly. I have a checklist of things I want to make sure they’ve done before and can do for me.\nDo they have soft skills?\nThis spans from the tactical to the interpersonal. Soft skills are just as essential as the ability to develop a persona or comprehend new technology. I’m looking for best practices they rely on, anecdotes from previous experiences, and other signs that they’re true practitioners.\nHow much did they pay attention?\nIt’s also an opportunity to see if they’ve fully digested the job description. I want them to prove that they understand the situation and assess the problems I’m looking for them to solve. Not regurgitation, but the ability to listen, digest, and translate into something actionable.\nI want to come away with a sense of who they are, how they work with others, and whether they’re empathetic and a good listener. If they can’t show me that over the phone and forge a connection, they won’t be able to do it with customers who don’t have as much invested in the conversation.\nStage 3: During the interview\nTest their abilities.\nOnce I finally get a chance to be in the same room with a candidate (or at least in the same video call), I rely on a go-to set of topics to ask them about to get a well-rounded picture of the potential hire before me.\nThen I ask them to do some of the things they’ll have to do on the job. Write a spec, reply to a customer complaint, that sort of thing.It’s a quick way to assess their ability to think on their feet and do the day-to-day work of a product manager.\nDownload a Day in a Product Manager's Life➜\nWhat part of the job do they care about?\nI’m asking questions to uncover what they care about and where their passion lies.\nWhat parts of the job excite them? Is it the customer interactions and interviews, solving problems and collaboration, or finding valuable use cases for new technologies?\nAre they quick on their feet?\nAnother test is whether or not they can think on their feet. I’ll frequently change subjects and see if they can keep up. This isn’t to trick them but rather to see if they’re up for the multitasking onslaught of context-switching that product management demands.\nWhat do they do outside of work?\nI also like to consider the “full human being” I’m talking to and not just the product professional side of their personality. I ask them what they like to do for fun and how they de-stress, which is important since product management can be pretty demanding and all-consuming.\nWhat do they care about?\nFinally, I want them to articulate what it is about the role that appeals to them. Why do they think they’ll like the job, and what about the company and position interests to them. This may seem obvious, but what they focus on and articulate can be insightful. For example, a generic response indicates they may not be that invested in the opportunity.\nWhat do they ask?\nBut what I ask is only half of it. The other part is seeing which questions they ask me. I’m looking for candidates that have an innate curiosity. If that doesn’t emerge during these sessions, it’s unlikely I’ll move forward.\nI’m actively hoping they’ll surprise me and take me out of my comfort zone. Questions I can’t answer or haven’t even thought of indicating they’re engaged and might bring a fresh new perspective to the team.\nAnd it’s all the better when they ask me a personal (yet appropriate) question. This shows they can connect on a human-to-human level and are trying to get a better feel for what it will be like to work for/with me. Not to mention it’s a good proxy for how they’ll fare conducting customer interviews.\nDo they think of the big picture?\nWhile the hiring process is all about filling a specific open role at a particular moment in time, we all know that situations change over time. Serious professionals aren’t only concerned about their next job, but the one that comes after that. That’s why I always touch on their career path during our interactions.\nI explain the current role, how it fits into the overall organization, and that even though they may not have direct reports, it doesn’t mean they’re not a senior team member. I also don’t base compensation on whether they’re managing other folks. The goal is product excellence and customer delight, not empire-building.\nBeyond that, I touch on where they could grow within the organization. On how this job will prepare them for future opportunities beyond this company. Although we’d love our product hires to stick around for decades, I’m not naive about how mobility plays into career development and am open about how this job positions them for long-term success.\nOf course, what I’m really looking for is the candidates to ask these questions as well. While bringing this topic up might make them a little uncomfortable, I also don’t want product people with no ambition or drive. As long as they’re not too aggressive on this front, I welcome them to consider their own future as they consider the job at hand.\nRead the Career Guide for Product Managers ➜\nA Good Use of Everyone’s Time\nWhen hiring product team members reviewing, screening, and interviewing potential fits takes a while if you’re doing it right. But if a lengthier process yields better fits for the organization that is likely to stick around for a while, it’s well worth the extra effort.\nA bad hire is a sunk cost, but it’s also a missed opportunity. The months wasted onboarding them, the negative customer experiences, and the problems that didn’t get solved are far costlier than taking more time to bring the right person in the first time around.\nThe best candidates will share your team’s values, complement the staff already in place, and augment the group’s overall capabilities. It’s one of the few times when being extra picky and diligent is worth a potential delay.\nWatch our webinar, Hiring and Growing a Successful Product Team, to see what product leaders look for when hiring new team members:\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/hiring-product/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925772497,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How I Learned to Embrace Uncertainty: Tips for Product Managers","text":"\n I’ll admit it, in the past, I’ve wrestled with needing to control uncertainty.\nFor years I thoroughly planned most everything and felt the need to know the eventual outcome of decisions. I had expectations, and if the expectations weren’t met, I was disappointed.\nWhether it was a product I managed or a vacation I took, I wanted to control the inevitable uncertainty.\nUncertainty is uncomfortable.\nAs a result, I found myself with a lingering sense that things were out of control. As a product manager, the uncertainty manifested in really detailed and lengthy Product Requirements Documents. I know I’m not the only product manager with this challenge.\nOver the years, I’ve realized through observation and personal experience that the most successful and happy people are those who are willing to embrace uncertainty. They are the ones who make “risky” decisions without knowing 100% of the information. It’s especially true for product managers, entrepreneurs, and others who want to launch products or ideas.\nDownload The Essentialist Product Manager ➜\nI’m much better now about letting things unfold without needing to know how the plan eventually will materialize. And yes, I get the irony that I’m the co-founder of ProductPlan, software that helps product managers visualize their plan. More on that later.\nThe Psychology of Uncertainty\nThe fear we all feel from uncertainty – and the feeling that we can control it – can cloud our thinking. After all, research consistently shows that humans are wired for seeking comfort, safety, and loss aversion. Our inner cave-person wants to avoid getting eaten by the tiger.\nA couple of years ago, our team read the fantastic book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize Winner in Economics. His research demonstrated that we choose options to avoid loss. We don’t behave logically when presented with the same choice framed in different ways.\nIn one example from the book, a disease that kills 1,286 people out of every 10,000 is considered more dangerous than a disease that kills 24.14% of the population. In studies, we believe the first disease to be more threatening even though the actual risk is significantly less than the alternative.\nWe also tend to overestimate our ability to control events – and this feeling that we can control a situation is an illusion. If we can stop for a moment and change our thinking that we’re not in as much control as we think, and surrender to it, we’re more likely to succeed because we’re open to change and opportunities we wouldn’t see otherwise.\nDownload Ship It: The Agile Product Manager's Guide to Products ➜\nI’m not saying that we never need to plan. I think two ways of living can co-exist – it’s possible to have outcomes-based goals and, at the same time, take decisive action without knowing the exact path with certainty.\nAnd I’ll add that it’s a lot more fun to work once I learned to live with the uncertainty.\nLessons for Product Managers\nI think there are many lessons for product managers in this philosophy. Here are a few thoughts for how product managers – especially those in an agile development environment – can embrace uncertainty and live with the inevitable discomfort. Hopefully, these ideas will help you focus on what matters.\nMake decisions based on outcomes\nOne way to live with uncertainty is to relax about the exact plan, and instead make decisions based on an outcome-driven goal. For example, rather than creating a list of arbitrary and disconnected features for your product, instead, focus on what your desired outcome is for customers – what is the goal you want them to achieve?\nBy focusing on an outcome-driven roadmap, you (and your team) have room to think about new possibilities, about different ways of achieving the goal.\nFocus on today (and maybe a few sprints out)\nThere’s an expectation of product managers to spell out the vision for our products and what the product looks like one or two years down the road.\nBut it’s problematic if this planning is too detailed. One or two years out any plan is only a fantasy. There’s no way things will go exactly to plan, and the goalpost will probably change along the way. You’ll never achieve perfection. This detailed planning, unfortunately, sets an expectation in your head (and your stakeholders’ heads) that simply won’t come true. It sets up everyone for disappointment.\nMy advice: Don’t plan too far ahead. Focus on the big picture vision in broad terms. Then, focus on what is in your control today to meet that vision. For your product planning, a few sprints out are far enough.\nGet comfortable with the discomfort\nStop spending as much time dwelling on problems at work and what-if thinking. You’re causing stress, which will affect you in all areas of your life. Spend more time working to solve the problems your customers are facing. Those are the fun problems.\nFor all the worst-case-scenario planners out there… cut the negative thinking. Why worry about all the endless gloomy scenarios that your (fearful) mind can conjure up? Plus, I believe that if you expect the worst, you’ll put yourself in a position of being close-minded to recognize new options and opportunities.\nI’m not saying that you should avoid realistic contingency planning, but truly, the five percent chance of a worst-case-scenario is unlikely to unfold. Spend your brainpower toward an optimistic outcome. Positive thinking really does affect. And your nights will be more restful.\nEmbrace confrontation\nAnother tip: Embrace confrontation. Stop avoiding the conversations you know you need to be having. I’m not saying to pick fights, but rather address conversations directly. Rather than avoiding conflict, micromanaging, or trying to prove someone wrong (controlling), have an honest upfront conversation about the situation.\nIncorporate stress reduction daily\nThe last bit of advice on another way I’ve found to embrace uncertainty at work and in life: give myself time for exercise and other mindfulness practices daily. I’m finding that when I prioritize this above other items, the rest of my day (life?) is happier, even when I get thrown a curveball I hadn’t expected.\nTakeaway\nIn the end, will you be a product manager who embraces uncertainty or one who plays it safe and avoids unpredictability? While it’s not a guarantee of success, I think I know which one stands a better chance.\nRead the Agile Product Manager's Guide to Building Better Roadmaps\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/embrace-uncertainty-product-managers/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925788295,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How I Overcame Imposter Syndrome as a Product Manager","text":"\n No matter how far into your career you might be, you’re never too old for imposter syndrome to make an appearance. Imposter syndrome is a feeling of inadequacy that persists despite the evident success, according to Harvard Business Review. ‘Imposters’ suffer from chronic self-doubt and a sense of intellectual fraud that override their feelings of success or external proof of their competence. Sound familiar?\nSo, to level the playing field. Even after years into my career as a product leader and founder, every so often, I too suffer from feeling like an imposter. We sometimes need to make decisions with imperfect information. Despite years of experience in this field, it still feels like I am taking risks as I lead ProductPlan into the unknown.\nFor example, with a recent project, the data wasn’t playing out the way we expected. We had to decide whether to adjust or stand pat, with no clear “right” answer in front of us. As an expert, I should know how to do all this. However, at that moment, I felt like an imposter. However, I’m not — and neither are you.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nWhy Product Managers are More Susceptible to Imposter Syndrome\nProduct managers (PM) are particularly vulnerable to experiencing imposter syndrome. The nature of our profession is nebulous. There a few reasons why product managers might be more susceptible to the feeling.\nFirst, no one gets a degree in “product management.” You don’t train for it. There’s no set path to becoming one. There also isn’t a universal definition of success for product managers. With no pedigree or success validation, it’s natural to feel like an imposter.\nColleagues also look to their product managers to have all the answers. Of course, we don’t have them all—nobody does. But we’re expected to know just enough about everything that we can speak intelligently and have an opinion on nearly every subject. It’s important for our role. This creates very high expectations, which plant the seeds of doubt in our minds.\nProduct managers also wield power in their organization, even if it’s not always reflected in the org chart. We have an awesome job to decide what’s in and what’s out. Others have input, but view us as the gatekeeper. Unfortunately, that puts a target for blame if things don’t succeed. This fear of letting people down compounds, so we start to second-guess ourselves.\nWith the weight of the product on our shoulders, we’re the ones to say “no” to various stakeholders. We’ll say no to customer ideas or inform the CEO that their pet project won’t make it onto the roadmap. All while wondering who decided we’re qualified to make that call?\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nHow I Overcame Imposter Syndrome (and How You Can Too)\nThere’s no magic bullet, but I have found a few things that helped me get over the hump.\n1. Humanize your counterparts\nEveryone is in the same boat. We’re all human and we all have fears that we have to push through. That means regardless of how much success or failures our peers have had, they’re still putting on their socks one at a time. By humanizing your counterparts, it takes away the fear and intimidation that people are inherently better or more qualified to do your job.\n2. Opportunity always comes again\nOnce it’s done, it’s done. Once a decision is made and acted on, then that ship has sailed. If it works out, great! If it doesn’t work out, there will be another chance to make another decision again. At that point, I’ll have learned from this mistake and be even better. There’s always tomorrow.\n3. Nobody knows everything\nAs disheartening as it is to realize, I will never have all the answers. Nobody knows everything. We’re all always operating with an incomplete data set and no guarantees. That’s not a defense to solely trust our gut and wing it. However, it does mean you need to move forward and believe that you’ve done enough homework to make an educated decision. Inaction due to uncertainty doesn’t breed innovation.\n4. Embrace collaboration\nEmbrace collaboration. The lone wolf product visionary that trusts no one, issues proclamation, and finds success is exceedingly rare. Most successful PMs learn fast that leveraging the knowledge, experience, and instincts of others makes things a lot easier. Not only are you operating with more information, but the decisions you make aren’t yours alone. Moreover, when others are involved in the process, they’re less likely to be resistant to the final decision.\n5. Use data to make decisions\nMetrics matter. You can use data to make decisions and convince others to get on board. This is a valuable tool for PMs. Not everyone is going to trust you. They might have their preconceptions and biases that you’ll be challenged to sway. However, with an argument based on facts instead of feelings, it’s much easier to build consensus, not to mention instilling confidence that you’re on the right path.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\n6. Vulnerability shows you have humility\nHonesty is the best policy. I prefer to be the person that is open and has good relationships with people versus the one who bulldozes their way through. No one likes a bully or a know-it-all. Don’t be afraid to tell people you’re not positive about something or are still seeking input from others. Others will appreciate if you expose your vulnerability, it shows you have humility.\nWhat I’ve Learned from Overcoming Imposter Syndrome as a Product Manager\nEveryone’s trying to figure it out, just like you. Once you realize and accept this, you can be much more empathetic to others. That forgiveness is contagious, and I’m certain will circle back to you.\nThe only way is to outgrow your doubts. It doesn’t happen overnight. But over time, as you have more successes under your belt and more positive experiences in your rearview, you begin feeling like you belong.\nDownload The Essentialist Product Manager ➜\nIt’s hard to do. But, try to stop caring about what other people think. When you’re confident in your abilities, you know you’re doing good work, and are treating people well then it becomes second nature. Now with all that free time you’ve created for yourself, you can do the fun stuff.\nYou don’t need that kind of stress. I’ve met plenty of older, successful people that are still racked with worry. Despite all they’ve accomplished, they can’t be content and convinced of their abilities. To them I say, “Relax, you’ve made it this far, and it wasn’t by accident.” Typically, this industry doesn’t put up with underperformers, so if you’ve made progress in your career, then you’re doing something right.\nLet your guard down. People can tell when you’re forcing it, so don’t bother putting on airs. You are who you are, and you’ll do a good job or you won’t. Have humility, take the time to figure things out based on the input of others, and have faith that you’ll make the best decisions you can.\nYou can’t lead or even garner the respect of your development team, you have to believe in yourself. Not unreasonably or unwaveringly, but with general faith in your competence and abilities. Without it, no one’s going to have your back or want to follow you into battle.\nConclusion\nDon’t let your insecurities hold you back! If your team didn’t think you could do the job, they wouldn’t work with you. Your requests for help are appreciated and not annoying.\nImposter syndrome is real and unhelpful to your career. Moreover, you can beat it. We’ve all been there. When you make mistakes, you’ll learn from them and be better for it.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/imposter-syndrome/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925706904,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How Product Organizations Can Balance Big Bets Versus Short-Term Wins","text":"\n When plotting out our product’s trajectory, there’s a constant tension between two competing mindsets. On the one hand, there’s the “go-big-or-go-home” moonshot approach. Where charismatic leaders rally the troops around an ambitious vision with a massive potential payoff. These high-risk gambits get praised when they succeed and pilloried when they fail.\nMeanwhile, the slow, steady drumbeat of cautious experimentation and incremental enhancements always makes the product better. However, they don’t fundamentally shake things up much. It’s not sexy and won’t land the leadership team any TED Talks. Yet the customer experience continually improves while KPI targets come into view.\nSome might think an organization must be all-in on one of these philosophies. How can you justify redirecting resources to tweaking the UX or integrating an API when they could spend time building the next big thing? Alternatively, how can we let our current customers suffer and miss out on easy wins just to chase after something that might not even work and won’t generate meaningful revenue for years?\nBig bets have big payoffs, but there’s a reason it’s called gambling\nIn the venture capital world, the prevailing strategy is to invest in multiple companies knowing that many will fail. But when one of them hits it big, it makes up for the 75% that fail to deliver a return.\nThis portfolio approach is baked into everything VCs do. They raise enough capital to spread their cash across a diverse enough collection of businesses. This way, they can weather the risk and wait around for their eventual payday. But your company isn’t a VC, even if some back it. You don’t have the cash to take so many risks or the runway to see which might eventually pan out.\nThis means you’ve only got so many swings at the plate to get a big bet right. So you want to make those chances count. That means doing your homework regarding market intelligence, product-market fit, technical feasibility, and the like.\nBut it also sets the stage for a parallel strategy that doesn’t sacrifice short-term wins. The team can still make minor changes and improvements that boost adoption, revenue, and retention while still pursuing big bets.\nHow can these things happen in parallel without chaos ensuing? Here are the four ingredients you need.\nA clear product vision\nEvery business and product needs a vision to guide everything that follows, from strategy to staffing to roadmaps. Taking a bifurcated approach to product development and innovation is more vital than ever.\nThe product vision defines where the business wants the product to be. The planning and tactics are set against that vision. This maintains focus and prevents shiny objects of all shapes and sizes from stealing the stoplight.\nA shared vision ensures that every project aligns with the vision. Whenever prioritization occurs, the prevailing vision provides only relevant, contributing items that rank highly.\nConnect Product Strategy to Execution in ProductPlan >\nStakeholder alignment\nStakeholders must buy into this strategy to push incremental value while working on more extensive initiatives. Inevitably, some influential voices will want to reach for the stars and not worry about the short-term—founders and CEOs often fall into this bucket—while others will lobby for projects that solve immediate pain points for current and prospective customers in the interest of keeping those folks happy, closing deals, and easing pressure on customer service.\nBoth sides have valid arguments for why the company should focus on its primary areas of concern. But instead of picking one path or another, organizations can take a “yes, and” approach by working on both initiatives.\nThis means you can’t chase as many big bets simultaneously nor knock out short-term wins as quickly as possible if the team was 100% focused on one or the other. But this strategy still addresses the here and now while working toward future growth and expansion.\nExplaining the benefits of this parallel approach and winning over holdouts is critical to establishing and maintaining stakeholder support, which trickles down to the rest of the staff. You can even work to get broad-based commitment to spending a specific percentage of product development resources on big bets, which should comprise at least 20% of the overall budget.\nBut beyond resource allocation, stakeholders must also embrace this approach’s inevitable risks and failures. Not all those big bets will work out, and those failures should be commended as learning opportunities rather than blame sessions.\nIdea management\nSince your business worries about the short-term and the big picture, there are more ideas than ever to consider. Keeping track of them all, ensuring they’re given proper consideration, and closing the feedback loop with the folks who make suggestions is essential and falls on the product team to manage.\nAs ideas come in and are periodically reviewed, they should be slotted into the appropriate track (big bet or short-term win) and then prioritized against currently ranked projects and other potential candidates. Once an idea gets rejected, put in the backlog, or slotted into a roadmap, whoever suggested it should be informed so they know their idea was taken seriously and followed up on.\nAnd remember, today’s bad idea might not look so terrible next month or next year, so don’t be too quick to dismiss them immediately out of hand. Building up a deep backlog of quality ideas that could be pursued under the right conditions is never a thing.\nAn end-to-end product management platform\nWhen an organization adopts a balanced product development approach, roadmapping, resource management, and launch planning get more complicated, and each phase requires something different from product management. But, with the right processes and tools in place, a lot of the heavy lifting and finicky fussing gets handled for you for every stage of the product management process.\nTake a tour of ProductPlan’s end-to-end product management platform >\nPrioritization\nThere’s no shortage of frameworks to help you and your colleagues sort, rank, and evaluate potential projects, but with an end-to-end product management platform, you can do it all right in one place. From capturing ideas to deciding which ones make the cut for the next release, you can tame your backlog and elevate winning ideas before slotting them into your product roadmaps.\nBe sure to evaluate and prioritize big bets separately from more incremental enhancements. You want an apples-to-apples ranking process that clearly delineates selecting a risky moonshot from debating which minor UX improvements to take on next.\nRoadmapping\nWhen adopting a balanced product strategy, product roadmaps are more crucial than ever to communicate essential information to stakeholders, colleagues, external partners, and customers. Given these roadmaps’ complex and interdependent nature, trying to manage them in a spreadsheet or slide deck is a disaster.\nYou need visual, theme-based roadmaps that convey the big ideas with the option to drill down into the details. With customized views, portfolio rollups, and a cloud-based viewer, you’ll always know everyone’s looking at the most accurate version. And each audience will get the specific level of detail and granularity they need.\nIt also provides more visual ways to ensure your roadmap has the right balance between big bets and incremental gains and differentiates between the lengthier timelines big bets demand and the rapid-fire short-term wins that get cranked out on the regular.\nWith a purpose-built product management solution, the product team can spend less time futzing around with formatting and version control. Instead, they can focus on understanding their market and talking with customers to turn feedback and findings into actionable insights. And the audience for these roadmaps gets consistent output across the product portfolio.\nLaunch Management\nExecuting a successful product launch requires a ton of collaboration and coordination to ensure all the messaging, deliverables, and events convey the appropriate talking points and value propositions for the product. And since different releases will have different goals—short-term win messaging will focus on current users and prospects, while big bets require much more fanfare and a broader push to attract new audiences.\nMuch of the planning, tracking, and communication around a launch can be streamlined and centralized with the right product management tool. Deadlines and progress are visible to everyone. Status reports are handled by the software, freeing up launch team members to spend more time actually doing the work. Best of all, because everything’s on the same platform, the launch plan and roadmap are connected and integrated. So you can pull elements out of the roadmap and directly into launch planning.\nKeep your balancing act in balance\nMost businesses that achieve sustained success pursue both paths simultaneously. They navigate the tricky terrain to keep adding value bit by bit while also chasing more elusive and substantial objectives. They can keep the lights on while still dreaming big by finding a formula that works for them. Each business has a unique situation. Funding, cash management, customer and contractual obligations, and the risk appetite of investors, the board, and senior leadership.\nAdopting this strategy might also be the winning formula for your product. But attempting to orchestrate all those moving pieces without the right tools in your product stack will be difficult.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/how-product-organizations-can-balance-big-bets-versus-short-term-wins/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925726591,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How To Build a Customer-Facing Roadmap That Communicates Your Product Vision","text":"\n At ProductPlan, we are revolutionizing how a company delivers products to market by elevating product organizations to the heart of strategy and execution. This vision holds true with our own organization as well. It is a very meta experience to build the ProductPlan platform as a go-to central hub for everything product management-related. As we help our customers overcome challenges, we’re using the same product we deliver to customers to overcome our own challenges. It’s a win-win situation!\nThis year, we focus on the major priorities that help us achieve our vision while maintaining an easy-to-use, delightful, and flexible user experience. Through this effort, we created a very exciting and strategic annual roadmap.\nWith so many impactful initiatives planned out for the year, we knew it was important to communicate with our customers and keep them updated on our product strategy. And what better way to do that than a customer-facing roadmap?\nWhy we built a customer-facing roadmap\nOur customers are one of the major driving forces behind what we decide to build. Their thoughts and feedback are an incredible source of information for our product team. In fact, customer interviews play a key role in what gets prioritized and put on our roadmap.\nThe purpose of our customer-facing roadmap is to communicate the vision of ProductPlan and, at a high level, show the steps we’re taking in 2022 to realize our vision. And by creating a customer-facing roadmap, we can address common questions from our customers like:\nWhat is ProductPlan working on right now?\nWhat new features and updates are coming next?\nAnd most importantly, why is ProductPlan doing what they are doing?\nThrough this exercise, we have uncovered helpful best practices and tips for creating your own customer-facing roadmap. Keep reading to learn more!\nHow we built our customer-facing roadmap\nWhen we began building our customer-facing roadmap, we thought about a frequently referenced metaphor for prioritization:\nIn this metaphor, you have a jar, rocks, pebbles, and sand. The goal is to fit the most important items into the jar. However, if you start with the sand and pebbles (the less important stuff), you quickly run out of room for the rocks. Instead, you start with the rocks, then the pebbles, and finally the sand. In that order, everything perfectly fits into the jar. The rocks leave gaps that the pebbles can fill, and the remaining gaps fill with sand.\nSo how does this translate to building a customer-facing roadmap?\nWe started with the rocks—these are the major items that we’re tackling to achieve our vision for the year. These are the product features that will have the greatest impact on our customers and therefore need to be on the customer-facing roadmap.\nThe smaller items (the pebbles and sand) typically don’t impact our entire customer base, and we don’t necessarily plan our development sprints around them. We can get more done when we properly prioritize these items according to importance.\nThe roadmap is designed to be dynamic and evolves over time. This can play out in a multitude of ways, but a great example is when we refined our filter functionality based on customer feedback. Thanks to the flexibility of our roadmap, we were able to accommodate this update.\nOrganizing major items on the roadmap\nOnce we decided on our “rocks” or major initiatives we planned for the year, our next focus was organizing this information into a roadmap that would make the most sense for our customers.\nWe organized four categories into columns from left to right on the roadmap to give our customers an insight into our plans. The four columns are:\nRecently released. The containers and bars in this column help our customers understand what problems we’ve recently solved.\nNow. Bars and containers in this column are problems we’ve committed to solving and are actively being built.\nNext. We’re currently researching bars and containers in this column and plan to build solutions for these problems next.\nFuture. Bars and containers featured in this column represent items we recognize as an opportunity to invest in research but have not committed to building yet. The information here gives our customers insight into what we are thinking about long-term.\nBelow, is a mockup of what this kind of customer-facing roadmap can look like.\nWe also break down our product vision using bars, containers, and lanes:\nThe Legend represents how we will execute our vision for the year. So everything featured in the customer-facing roadmap lines up to specific items in the legend.\nLanes represent areas of investment. These areas are how we spend our time and help us ensure we can organize our resources towards our specific goals throughout the year.\nContainers organize bars and provide additional context.\nBars feature details about specific features that contribute to the overall objective.\nOur roadmap does not include everything we have planned for the year. It would be way too overwhelming if that were the case. So the smaller items, our pebbles and sand, don’t make it on the roadmap because they are lower priorities. Instead, we include them in our regularly scheduled release notes.\nTake a look at the mock-up below to see how changes and updates to the container and bar details can be communicated in the Highlights section.\nIt’s important to note that we restart the roadmap each year, so we focus on the specific vision and goals that we set for that year.\nHow we share our roadmap\nOur roadmap is a tool for starting a conversation with our customers. It is also an opportunity to learn more from our customers. Their feedback from conversations where we share the customer-facing roadmap helps us inform and refine our plan.\nOur customer success team is trained on the ins and outs of our customer-facing roadmap so that we can have these important conversations at scale. With this training, our customer success team can speak confidently to the problems we are solving, they provide the product team with more insightful customer feedback, and it is a great way to develop deeper relationships with our customers.\nAs an added bonus, our roadmap also serves as a great training tool for our customers so they can build their own customer-facing roadmaps.\nLooking to the future\nWe’re so excited about all of the major enhancements and updates planned for the year. Additionally, we’re looking forward to continuing our work with our customers to achieve our vision of revolutionizing product management.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/customer-facing-roadmap-communicate-product-vision/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925722839,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How We're Turning Feedback into Strategic Product Decisions","text":"\n There is no shortage of product ideas. They come from everywhere. Customer feedback, feature requests, and new ideas born from your interpretation of your product strategy—can all be the starting point for your company’s next great opportunity.\nThe challenge has never been finding more things to consider. Of course, there’s always plenty to consider.\nThe real challenge is to cut through the noise and identify what’s actually worth pursuing.\nEarlier this year, we set out to solve this challenge. Specifically, we want to help product teams make better decisions. Yes, that starts with a way to capture and organize ideas. But it must also include a way to connect these ideas to the broader opportunities they represent.\nMost of all, we want to help you avoid the feature factory, a dreary place where product teams are encouraged to ship more features faster without validating ideas or assessing impact after launch. In the feature factory scenario, what gets built next is often decided by who yells their idea the loudest. It’s a frustrating, demoralizing, and ultimately unsuccessful way to create a product.\nHow are product teams managing their ideas today?\nOver the years, we’ve talked to our customers about this challenge. And it is a problem without a great solution. The solutions that do exist today tend to fall into two camps.\n1. Repurposed existing solutions\nThe first camp consists of ad hoc solutions created using your digital workspace’s existing tools. You know them well.\nIt’s the cluttered spreadsheet of ideas that was created years ago by someone who no longer works at your company. There are multiple versions of it living… somewhere. Which one is most current is anyone’s guess.\nOr it’s a Google form shared amongst internal stakeholders and customers. Anyone can submit an idea for something they want you to build at any time. It is great if you like your ideas repository like you like your volcanoes—explosive, violent, and wholly unmanageable if caught in the vicinity of its spew.\n2. “Purpose-built” solutions\nThe second camp consists of “purpose-built” solutions. Many product management platforms attempt to help teams collect and manage their ideas. Some provide a customer-facing inbox for feature requests. Others have created integrations with popular tools that allow product teams to capture ideas where stakeholders live and work.\nWith enough time and maintenance, any of these solutions can be a viable way to collect and organize product ideas. But if not careful, these solutions can also encourage a feature-factory approach to product management. An idea alone does not solve a problem. The most challenging job isn’t necessarily collecting feedback. It is defining the opportunities or problems the feedback aims to solve.\nAnd, of course, not all ideas are created equal.\nIdeas should be used to validate (or invalidate) broader opportunities.\nThe problem with ideas is that they typically land on a product manager’s desk as a feature request. When this happens, it skips an essential part of the product manager’s process.\nThe product manager’s job is to hear the pain a customer experiences or the goals they hope to achieve. Then the product manager researches to understand how they can build a solution that won’t only work for that one customer but entire segments of their customer base. The solution must also align with and help achieve the business’s goals, be it retaining more customers, increasing the speed of adoption, or tackling a new market.\nFor an idea management solution to work for product teams, it must separate the idea from the opportunity. On their own, ideas often exist in the solution space. They might suggest a feature to build, for instance. But when captured in mass, ideas will point to common problems worth solving. Trends will emerge. These are your opportunities. From there, it’s on you – the product manager – to develop a solution that helps your organization attain the desired outcome.\nIt can also work in reverse. For example, take the goals and objectives your business prioritizes during its annual or quarterly planning sessions. Then, you can translate the goals and objectives into opportunities for the product team. From here, it’s a process of sourcing ideas that can support and validate the opportunities your business pursues or, in some cases, invalidates them.\nIt’s all about helping product people make better decisions, using the ideas they’ve sourced as invaluable insights to prioritize.\nIdeas should inform your roadmap—they shouldn’t replace it\nMany product people we speak with talk about the agony of a bottomless pit of ideas. An overflowing inbox. A dumpster of post-it notes. It might be tempting to toss all those ideas into your backlog, eventually creating a roadmap out of the best ones.\nDoing idea management this way is a sure path to the feature factory model. Unfortunately, it creates a reactive roadmap rather than a proactive one. And it can result in your product organization—and your business—careening in the wrong direction.\nOver the next couple of months, we’re excited to show you what we’re building to help you avoid the agony of an endless supply of ideas. For now, know that our goals are as follows:\nWe want to help minimize the time spent collecting, consolidating, and understanding customer feedback\nWe want to help you improve how you make product decisions\nWe want to help you minimize the likelihood of misalignment with your company vision or time spent working on the wrong things\nDigital transformation is all the rage right now. Idea management is one of the last remnants of that non-digital era. Unfortunately, many companies still consider it a crowd-sourced way to build your roadmap. This is not the right way to do it. Sure, you’ll get some good ideas (and some bad ones), but if you’re not aligning them to your product strategy, you’ll just be flying blind and wasting time.\nStay tuned for more about ideas management from ProductPlan!\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/feedback-strategic-product-decisions/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925790650,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How to Choose a Great SaaS Pricing Model","text":"\n It’s a brave new world for pricing software-as-a-service products. Gone are the days of simply setting a per-seat fee and launching. How can you choose the best SaaS pricing model for your product?\nIn this SaaS pricing series, I review lessons I’ve learned from helping set pricing for several successful SaaS products. In my first article, I reviewed why pricing based on customer value is so important.\nThis second article reviews why SaaS gives product and marketing managers unprecedented flexibility to choose unique pricing models. Models that can differentiate your product in the marketplace. Models that ideally align with your customers’ goals.\nSaaS Pricing Flexibility\nOne of the exciting advantages of SaaS is that you can think differently about pricing models. Unlike traditional software, customers licensing SaaS products pay for your product on a recurring basis. Your product is no longer tied to a one-time purchase. And because the product is centrally hosted, you have additional flexibility for offering your product in unique packages.\nRead the Power of SaaS Pricing Experiments ➜\nSaaS Pricing Models: a Short List\nSaaS gives you the ability to consider revenue models that weren’t previously possible. Here’s a short (and by no means exhaustive) list of SaaS pricing models used today. Many products use a combination of these models:\nPer-user (many SaaS products)\nPer-user with free participants (GoToMeeting, ProductPlan)\nStorage (Dropbox)\nFeatures (plans based on feature tiers)\nProject (Basecamp)\nFreemium (LinkedIn)\nPer item/contact (AppFolio, Hubspot)\nPer Node/Server (Hadoop)\nPer Visitor/Traffic (AdRoll)\nProcessor time/Data transferred (Amazon Web Services)\nOpen Source (free with paid services)\nAdvertising (Facebook)\nBroker fee (AirBnB)\nFeel free to add to this list in the comments. My point is that with so many options, you now have the ability to discover a pricing model that aligns with your customers’ goals.\nTo learn how to make subscription pricing work for you, watch our webinar:\nSuccess-Based SaaS Pricing Model Example\nFor AppFolio’s property-management software, we developed a unique pricing model based on the number of rental units managed by a property manager. Because we charged a flat $1 per rental unit per month, the pricing was simple and easy to understand.\nThis SaaS pricing model resonated with customers because it aligned with their business goals. They paid more for our product only if they grew their business by adding rental units to their portfolio. If they were more successful, we were more successful.\nDon’t be Tempted by Competitive Pricing\nWhen pricing a new product, there is a temptation to set your pricing relative to the competition. It’s common for new products to price using the same model as competitors, but slightly lower. Sure, you can price your product the same way as your competitors, and perhaps that’s what your customers expect.\nBut with SaaS, there are so many ways to price the product that you have the ability to stand out in the market by thinking differently. Capitalize on the approaches that your competitors haven’t considered. In my previous article, I described how we launched GoToMeeting with innovative pricing that disrupted the competitors.\nKeep it Simple\nDon’t overly-complicate pricing. With so much flexibility in SaaS pricing model options, there is a temptation to offer various flavors and packages.\nSometimes there are legitimate reasons for doing so. For example, it’s common to have three packages based on features. Studies show that this approach anchors customers, and can be an effective technique for driving customers to your best-performing package. That’s fine if this is your goal.\nHowever, creating an overly complicated pricing scheme has the potential to confuse customers and create a nightmare for your finance team. Keeping it simple reduces headaches and may even provide more revenue over the long term.\nFor example, at ProductPlan (product roadmap software), we saw that products in our space had complicated licensing options. Many required a paid license for every software user. Several offered complicated pricing tiers based on packages.\nWe took a different approach to simplify pricing. We charged only for editors of roadmap data and offered free licenses to other collaborators. Rather than offering complicated pricing tiers based on features, we offered unlimited use of all features for one price.\nBecause the product managers want to widely distribute the product roadmap to stakeholders, this SaaS pricing model benefits the customer. It’s aligned with their goals. In addition, this model gives our product more exposure within the organization, so ultimately we sell more licenses when other departments ask to use the software.\nIn the next article, I’ll review several tips for successful pricing, including estimating lifetime value.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/pricing-model-saas-product/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925791984,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How to Foster a Culture of Gratitude","text":"\n As we head into a new year, we tend to talk more about gratitude. We talk about what we’re grateful for in our own lives, and often express gratitude for the friends, family, and coworkers we have around us.\nWe’ve tried to foster a culture of “thank you” at ProductPlan. And lately, I’ve thought a lot about what gratitude means for the people we work with. Today, I’d like to share a bit about the role of gratitude at ProductPlan. Hopefully some of these thoughts might help you at your workplace.\nI’d like to say that there’s some magical formula for fostering a grateful culture within your organization, but there isn’t. A culture of gratitude, or a culture of thank you doesn’t materialize on its own. Our culture at ProductPlan is the result of consistency in our values and decision-making from the very beginning.\nWe wanted ProductPlan to be a place where people genuinely enjoy coming to work; a place where people feel that they are contributing towards something important. We wanted our team to see the significant ways they help build great products and we wanted them to enjoy working with our customers and with each other.\nGratitude and appreciation are key to creating the environment we set out to create from the get go. I’ll discuss how we did this shortly, but first let’s look at why. Why does gratitude matter? Why is it something we should all strive for? Let’s see what science has to say.\nThe Science of Gratitude\nTo start, what exactly is gratitude anyway? Gratitude, to me, means taking a moment and recognizing the good things that we have and the good things that other people are doing. It sounds easy right?\nBut if we look closer, there are actually a few different ways in which we interact with gratitude. We can feel grateful, we can express our gratitude, and we can receive expressions of gratitude.\nVarious studies over the past century or so exploring our different reactions with gratitude have revealed multitudes of benefits of gratitude in the context of both health & wellness and social . For example, feeling grateful not only increases life satisfaction but also one’s willingness to help others. And, the act of taking time to express gratitude is a proven mood-booster.\nThe Importance of Gratitude at Work\nMy co-founder Greg and I both have previously worked with enough teams and at enough companies to recognize what it feels like to operate in organizational cultures that lack a sense of appreciation.\nIt’s not surprising that research shows our perceptions of gratitude in the workplace can be fairly complex. A recent study on US Americans’ relationship with gratitude found the majority of people wish they were thanked more often at work. Meanwhile, that same study found that the office is the place where people are least likely to express gratitude.\nSo let’s break that down: employees feel that they should be appreciated more, yet don’t feel that they should verbalize their appreciation for others at work. Yikes.\nWe strive to foster an environment in which everyone not only feels appreciated, but also freely expresses their gratitude to others. Initially, this was the product of our belief in practicing the golden rule “treat others as you’d like to be treated.” But, beyond simply being the right thing to do, we’ve also noticed many other positive benefits of our culture of gratitude.\nGratitude Keeps our Team Motivated\nIn the office, I see and overhear people doing small things for each other every day; helping them on something, picking up the phone to help someone who is away, volunteering to take on extra work to help out a colleague who already has a full schedule. It’s wonderful to witness this.\nIt’s exactly the sort of environment that I want to create. We never hear someone say “that’s not my job!” but quite frequently hear “how can I help you out?”\nWhen you’re on the receiving end of an expression of gratitude, you feel appreciated and that your work is being recognized. But beyond those emotions, researchers found that people who are thanked for their efforts are driven to work harder and volunteer to help more in the future.\nSo if you want to motivate your team, don’t forget to take time every now and then to thank them for their efforts. It doesn’t take much, but your sentiments can go a long way.\nGratitude Improves Relationships and Encourages Collaboration\nIn addition to keeping our team motivated, gratitude plays a role in promoting better teamwork. Sharing our appreciation with the team has encouraged them to do the same amongst each other. I hear it all the time in the office. And while knowing gratitude is present is reward enough for me, there’s an even bigger upside for the team as a whole.\nGratitude exchanges among colleagues are proven to positively impact prosocial behaviors. Those who feel and express gratitude to colleagues are more motivated to spend time with others and work on improving the relationship. Meanwhile, those who are thanked for their work are often more willing to broaden the scope of the help and support they offer others at work.\nSomething as simple as hearing a colleague say, “hey, thank you for helping me out with this project,” can promote closer collaboration and teamwork.\nReceiving Gratitude Reduces Likelihood of Burnout\nWe care deeply about the health and wellness of our team at ProductPlan. And that’s another reason gratitude is important for our culture. In addition to motivating and driving collaboration, when people feel appreciated, they are less likely to experience burnout.\nSoftware startups and other fast-paced organizations are notorious for having high rates of burnout amongst employees. We don’t want that, and it turns out gratitude helps. A 2015 study found nurses (one of the professions with the highest burnout rate) who received expressions of thank you from patients were significantly less likely to experience burnout than their peers who did not. This is not surprising. If our work benefits others, we want to know about it and feel valued by them. But what is surprising is how little effort it takes to show people they are valued.\nTaking just a few moments out of every day to express your appreciation can make a huge impact on your team’s happiness and employee retention.\nDon’t pass up gratitude at work. There’s no doubt that there are countless benefits of gratitude at work. But in fast-paced environments, it can easily slip off the radar. So let’s look at how to avoid that by diving into how exactly we can make gratitude part of the employee experience.\nHow We’ve Fostered a Culture of Gratitude at ProductPlan\nPart of our success in fostering a culture of gratitude is arguably due to our motivations for founding ProductPlan. Greg and I founded ProductPlan because we like to build products and solve problems. We didn’t get into the business of product roadmapping software for ego-based reasons. Of course we saw value in improving product roadmaps, but we founded ProductPlan largely because we saw a fun and interesting opportunity to create something.\nBut there was more to it than a motivation to have fun and a few well-timed thank yous. Here’s a few of the ways we’ve established and maintained a culture of gratitude at ProductPlan.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nMake Gratitude a Habit\nEverybody is busy and everybody has their own experiences. Sometimes we can feel completely overwhelmed at work, and to top it off we all also have personal lives too. When we have all these things going on, it can be hard to come up for air and recognize how good we truly have it.\nSo, I think it’s important to make gratitude a habit. And by this I mean, making time to step out of yourself to be aware of what’s happening right now. If you’re stressed at work, it can be as simple as remembering that you have a job to stress you out in the first place. And beyond that, there are most likely other people around you going through the exact same thing that you are. Why not be grateful and appreciative of them?\nGet in the habit of taking moments of time to yourself for gratitude. Step away from the chaos for a moment, and you’ll give yourself a better opportunity to recognize the good things happening. You don’t necessarily have to start a gratitude journal or meditate to do this, the separation alone is often enough to get you thinking. I like to go for walks around the block; getting a little exercise and breathing fresh air helps me remember and appreciate the good things.\nSometimes it’s hard to get the blocks of time for this habit. What works for me is making it part of my daily routine. There’s this tendency for many people to sit there and work while eating lunch at their desks. And that’s ok, but I still think it’s important to take breaks to get you outside and into a different headspace. That’s why I love to take advantage of my lunch break for this.\nPay it Forward\n“Actions speak louder than words” they say. And that applies to gratitude in some ways as well. Leadership plays a significant role in an organization’s relationship to gratitude.\nMy first job was a very typical corporate job where you walked in and there were rows upon rows of desks. I was just out of college and eager to learn. Productivity was of the utmost importance at this organization, so I worked hard. Certainly people said “thank you,” here and there, but I see now that something critical was missing: the culture didn’t value people or support helping them grow.\nI, like many others, was simply a cog in the wheel of this 40,000 person company. My career and happiness did not matter to them. I think everyone with enough years in the workforce has been somewhere like this. Even in larger organizations, a lot of this culture has to do with management and how they approach things. It is possible to foster this culture at a large organization if management consciously commits to it.\nFor us, it’s common sense: our team’s success is directly correlated with our own. We truly value each individual on our team. After all, we couldn’t possibly be successful without them! So, management is on board to support every member of the team in not only getting the experience they want, but also in general being happy in their career (even if this means eventually they’ll take their talents to somewhere other than ProductPlan). This is just one way we put gratitude into action here.\nHire the Right People\nAs we’ve grown, we’ve hired a lot. And we look well beyond talent and experience when we hire. A big part of building our culture is hiring genuinely kind people who share our values. For us gratitude is not a tactic, it’s a philosophy. It’s the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated.\n“Thank you” should not come with ulterior motives. We don’t express gratitude because we want somebody to do something. This sort of manipulative pseudo-gratitude isn’t how we operate here. We say thank you because we genuinely care and want the people around us to be successful. And we hire people who bring that same philosophy with them to work.\nBut how do you make hiring decisions that help us continue driving this culture? It can be tricky to suss this out completely during the interview process. Sometimes the version of someone you meet in an interview is not the same as the one who comes into the office on the first day. And, I’d be lying if I said we’ve never made a mistake there.\nFor the most part, we have been incredibly fortunate. It seems that we somehow attract people with similar values. In addition, Santa Barbara is somewhat of a small town and because of that, we’ve been able to hire and work with many people with whom we’ve previously worked. That history counts for a lot because we know who they are and the philosophies they bring to work.\nOf course, we can’t always hire someone we’ve worked with before. For key hires it’s really important for us to understand their past history. And that’s where references become incredibly helpful. When we talk with references, we look beyond experience. It’s important for us to understand who someone is as a human, too.\nPractice Patience\nFinally, there are some days when it’s easier to feel gratitude than others. For example, sometimes people can frustrate you. Perhaps it’s because they’ve disappointed you, or they’re not reaching their full potential or meeting their goals. I think that taking a deep breath and finding the gratitude and the good things that you see in other people helps a lot with patience. And patience is an important part of gratitude.\nThank You.\nTo wrap things up, I’ll leave you with this: it’s never too late to start being grateful. I know I’ve mentioned many times that what we have is the product of long-term efforts. But, you too can drive a shift in your organization toward a culture of thank you. Here’s a few things you can do starting today.\nThink of one thing you’re grateful for. Write it down in a journal or vocalize it to a cherished friend.\nIncorporate gratitude into your daily standups. Have people share “I’m grateful for _____” in addition to their normal talking points.\nMake time every week to personally express your gratitude to someone on your team either verbally or in a written note.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/how-to-foster-a-culture-of-gratitude/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925740673,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How to Handle Resistance to Change Management","text":"\n If you’re responsible for change management at your company, you have my respect. My sympathies, too. Because the resistance to change management can be difficult. People find it easy, even fun, to envision a great outcome. But the resistance to change management can negatively affect this excitement.\nSo, in this post, let’s talk through the common reasons businesses face resistance to change. When you understand and recognize these reasons, you position yourself to address and overcome them. Then I’ll offer a few suggestions for a successful change management process.\nWhy You’ll Encounter Resistance to Change (and You Will, Every Time)\n1. People are often unaware that their daily actions conflict with their aspirations.\nI once worked for a CEO who liked to describe our company as product-team driven. He truly believed he’d built an organization that empowered the product department to lead the strategy.\nBut in practice, that wasn’t the case. The CEO set all priorities and approved or rejected all product ideas. When the product team came up with viable concepts and produced evidence that these products could succeed in the market, the CEO often said no, ending the project.\nIf someone had proposed a plan to shift the company culture to be more product-team-led, the CEO would have rejected that idea as well. His resistance would have stemmed from the fact that he believed we already had a product-driven company.\nOne reason you might face resistance to change is that your team believes—or at least wants to imagine—that they have already adopted the new framework you’re suggesting. “Hey, we’re already a customer-centric business.”\nDownload Developing a Product Team Checklist ➜\n2. Inertia is a powerful driver of human behavior.\nWhen you present a plan for digital transformation or some other company-wide change, many people’s first instinct will be to feel threatened or worried. Their second instinct will be to push back against your plan.\nEveryone has routines and processes that make them feel comfortable. With your sweeping change proposal, you’ll be asking them to give up some or even most of these routines. Additionally, some people on your team could worry that they will have a diminished role under your new framework. Others might have the opposite concern: that they will have to take on more work and responsibility.\nOften the resistance you will face in your change management efforts will have nothing to do with the merits of the approach or framework you’re proposing. It will simply be the result of your team’s fear of shifting to a new process in which they might not be as needed or successful.\n3. People might not realize what they’re committing to when they sign on for the change.\nLet’s say you persuade your company to make a change. You begin rolling out the new processes. For a time, everyone seems to be adjusting smoothly. But then something happens. A reality sets in that your team hadn’t physiologically prepared for.\nHere’s what that might look like under a couple of real-world examples.\nTransform Your Organization from Traditional Marketing to Product-Led Growth\nSure, your stakeholders might have found this idea exciting in principle. It sounded great: Let’s be like Slack and make a free version of our product so compelling that people can’t help but share it and market it for us. We can even cut down on our paid marketing campaigns.\nBut then the first month passes, and your paid signup rate is down. That was part of your product-led growth model, and everyone agreed in theory. But experiencing a month of lower-than-normal revenue could make your executives panic. Will they demand the company reactivate its costly marketing campaigns to generate immediate revenue?\nTransform Your Product Development Process from Waterfall to Agile\nChanging your company’s development approach from waterfall to agile might be a wise strategic decision. And at first, you might find a lot of enthusiasm across the company. In the abstract, saying “We’re an agile shop” will probably sound appealing to your stakeholders.\nBut let’s do another thought experiment. Imagine your company has made this transformation its official policy, and your cross-functional team is about to begin work on a new product, with natural resources and budget on the line.\nWill your development team panic at the idea of starting their work without a complete vision of the full-featured product?\nDoes your executive team be willing to greenlight a new product without a firm market launch date?\nWill your product team have the discipline to turn down stories that aren’t ready for development in their weekly sprint planning?\nDownload the Product Development Roadmap Checklist ➜\nResistance to Change Is Part of Human Nature\nAs I hoped I’d communicated, resistance to change often stems from our hardwiring.\nIn some cases, you’ll have trouble earning buy-in for a transformation because your coworkers envision themselves as having already made the change. In other cases, they’ll push back because they feel more comfortable with a legacy approach or worry about their fate under new conditions. Sometimes, your team will agree to the change first but then abandon it when it leads to challenges.\nBottom line: Do not expect to pull off a company change with zero pushback. Dealing with resistance is part of the change management process.\nBut you can reduce this resistance and earn more trust and enthusiasm for your plan by following some best practices. I’ve outlined them below.\n6 Steps to Successful Change Management\n1. Present the potential benefits to your stakeholders.\nBefore you describe how much work the transformation will require, you should explain to your team why it will be worth the effort. Keep your description of the upside anchored to reality but let your enthusiasm for the new framework show. If you’re going to earn buy-in for the change, you’ll need your team to be enthusiastic about it.\n2. Explain honestly the effort needed to make the change happen.\nEveryone needs to know upfront what they’re getting into when they sign on to your proposed transformation. That will minimize the culture shock your company experiences as people run into the inevitable bumps along the way.\nIf you’re proposing a shift from waterfall to agile, what if anything is agile about your current practices? If your processes are entirely waterfall, you need to explain the significant adjustment this represents for everyone involved.\n3. Let your team know what success will look like.\nOne common reason employees resist proposals for change is that the process seems endless. Your stakeholders could legitimately worry about you following them around forever, saying: “Can we make this process more agile?” “How can we make that routine more agile?”\nA key to earning stakeholder buy-in for your plan is to give everyone a picture of what it will look like when they’ve completed the change. That will provide them with something tangible. It will also counter the fear they have in their minds that they’ll never get done once they start this process.\n4. Evangelize the change throughout the process.\nEvery change implementation faces setbacks and frustrations. As the driver behind this change management effort, an essential part of your role will be to continually serve as the plan’s advocate and champion. You’re there to remind your coworkers that the struggles they’re experiencing during the change will pay off when the company becomes more vital, more competitive, more profitable, etc.\nYou might have this conversation dozens of times with different stakeholders. Heck, you might have to evangelize to the same stakeholders repeatedly. Some people will need more convincing, more pep talks to keep them on track. That’s okay. Bring the same level of enthusiasm and confidence to your evangelizing every time.\n5. Establish celebratory milestones along the way.\nYou’ve shown your team the end state of your transformation. They have a picture of the finish line. Still, many of them will experience change fatigue at different points in the process.\nOne way to counter this is to create internal victories to celebrate throughout the process. Send out positive updates when the company achieves a milestone along the way—schedule parties for internal accomplishments throughout the transformation. Give out awards to stakeholders: Maybe honor an “Agile Hero of the Week” for your agile transformation.\n6. Remain resilient.\nEssential stakeholders may tire of the changes you plan to implement. It is also important to note that you may also get fatigued from changes.\nAs your coworkers push back against the change or show signs of frustration with it, you’re going to be tempted to throw up your hands and revert to the old process.\nThis is where you need to remain resilient, remind yourself about the strategic benefits of implementing this change and maybe even evangelize the plan for yourself.\nStart Roadmapping Your Change Management Plan➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/resistance-to-change/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925782309,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"How to Retroactively Measure Product Vision Success","text":"\n A 2020 study conducted by Clutch surveyed over 500 businesses. Only 5% of companies identified that they accomplished all their goals in the past fiscal year. Moreover, the survey results established that 65% of those businesses completed at least half of their goals. Clutch’s survey proves that you need an effective product management strategy to measure product vision success. \nAs a product leader, your product vision anchors everything you communicate to your team. The concept provides your organization with the ideal product. \nFirst, you must realize you need to test your product vision before developing a product strategy. Much like the agile process, your picture gets better as you build, measure, and learn. As such, your product vision becomes the product narrative you, as a leader, tells.\nWhile looking back at your vision, you’ll need to make sure your team remains proactive. Remember, your product vision may be an idea or an aspiration. To help your product team get there, you’ll need to learn from your actions.\nYou’ll need to put your head down to gather information and then sell the rest of the company on your vision. Your product vision reflects the big picture and helps you, your team, and your peers make long-term decisions. Your informed decision-making drives your culture and moves the business forward.\nThe vision may remain stagnant, though. Even after you write it, the product strategy needs to evolve. Adjustments lead to significant improvements. \nThe end of the fiscal year can provide your team with the time to adjust. Let’s talk about answering the question:\nHow did I do last year?\nProduct Vision Exists In The Work You’ve Done.\nMetrics are crucial. When it comes to vision, you can’t count clicks. \nThat is where proxy metrics come in. Proxy metrics are variables that can help you understand something unobservable. So when it comes to vision or leadership, having great proxy metrics is essential.\nProxy metrics help you gain visibility into how you operationalize that vision. That’s where goal frameworks come into play. \nProxy metrics, even far removed from the leadership level, can give insight. Let’s take a goal framework and go a little deeper into what they can tell you, even if it’s four levels down. \nObjective and Key Results (OKRs) are popular these days. When they work well, they function as an excellent proxy metric. Why? They can help a leader see how aligned the team is via something as simple as a spreadsheet. \nA good question to ask here is, are the objectives you see aligned to that ideal vision? \nIf those objectives aren’t, there is no better time to think back to what caused the misalignment to the vision. \nDid something change? \nAre teams getting the correct information?\nDo teams feel safe enough to ask questions?\nAll good things to think about as you judge how close you are to those product ideals: now, how about a particular measurement to keep alignment?\nTracking A North Star Metric Helps Tie Movement To Vision\nAnother tool to help set alignment is a north star metric. As John Cutler mentions on the blog, an effective north star metric keeps alignment. It’s important to remember the key characteristics of an influential North Star:\nNorth star helps focus on customer value and the exchange of value. For example, daily active users (DAUs) don’t tell you anything about the value exchanged.\nThe metric represents your unique product strategy.\nMoreover, it connects the customer value you are trying to create as a product team. The executive team cares about this connection the most.\nAs a north star becomes real, this is a great time to look at the initiatives to see if they moved your north star by looking at the significant projects shipped to see how they affected your north star.\nDid you see spikes in your proxy metrics or North Star?\nHow about any dips? \nDid you make any bets in your product strategy that would affect the North Star? How did those bets pan out? \nRemember, things don’t always go to plan. The releases that happened during the year may have had an adverse effect. Ignore this at your peril.\nFailures Are Essential, Too\nSuccess is helpful for team morale. That said, analyzed failure is more beneficial for team growth.\nLet’s be clear. Failure on its own isn’t helpful. Don’t fall into the trap of lionizing failure for the sake of loss. Spend time analyzing the failure so that teams can understand how to make better choices in the future and learn how to prioritize their time better around the demands of product planning.\nWhy? Product development doesn’t always go to plan. In fact, as a product leader, if things always went how you planned, you aren’t paid enough. Sometimes, taking a risk, or force de jour, bad things happen.\nThe bad news is failure doesn’t feel good. The good news is once you’ve had some time to recover, there are lessons in failure. Those lessons can help you and your team get even better the following year. \nEmbrace Your Product Failures\nWrite them down. Do not hide those failures. Failures come in different forms. \nA quick note: it’s easy to point out the vast failures. The ones that create ripples in the organization are substantial to note. They are drama-filled, and your strategy may change forever. Make sure, though, that you capture the less noisy failures. These look different but can be as deadly long-term. \nYou need to judge features by the return on investment as much as the noise they create. \nThe project went “according to plan” yet didn’t make a splash in the marketplace. It’s a slack integration that didn’t move the north star. You invested in a product team for a quarter, and nothing changed. \nThese failures are silent at the moment but cost the company millions. But when you catch them, offer a great chance to look at the process. \nThe failure is an opportunity to look at your process: \nWas our discovery process unclear? \nWas this a me-too feature – something we saw our competitors do and copied? \nWhy was this prioritized?\nThings don’t always go to plan. Your team will go through trials, and those trials are unavoidable. What separates the product visions that evolve from those that wither? Product teams use what they go through as fuel. As you judge the year, it’s a great time to look at those failures and see what you can learn.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nFacing the Consequences of Your Product Vision Decision\nYour failures, and successes, for that matter, don’t exist in a bubble. The company that supports your product vision is an organism. The organism adjusts to what happens. \nAfter an event happens, something happens afterward. That “something” is a “second-order effect.” \nSecond-Order Effect refers to the idea that every action has a consequence. Then, each result has a result.\nIn other words, a single decision can start a series of cause-and-effect. The results can lead to shifts in culture. \nThere are bound to be shocking things, some of which felt “out of nowhere.” That is likely the second-order effect of an outcome. \nWrite those surprises, and like you did with team failures, investigate them. \nLet’s take that Slack integration we talked about earlier. The feature had a specific purpose. But, the lack of impact could have had some downstream effects. \nWas there a particular decision that led to a shift in something unrelated?\nDid our communication patterns change? \nWere there any culture changes that caught us by surprise?\nWriting down what took the team by surprise can help you draw a map of those second-order effects. If you create clarity there, you can use them to fuel your growth into next year.\nHow to Utilize Customer Segmentation\nYou’ll find that the issues you have will not apply to everyone. When taking a look back at the year, it’s a tremendous opportunity to ask yourself the question:\nDo we care about these people?\nIt doesn’t seem warm-hearted, but our vision can’t do everything for everyone. When teams spend time on customers that don’t fit with the business, they waste time. \nWhen you build for someone you don’t intend to serve, you are stealing from valuable customers. Stealing time may seem harsh, but that is an outcome of a lack of focus. \nSo, who are your most important customers? Now is the time to take the time to talk to your team and look at the data: \nWhat customers drive revenue?\nWho are the customers that drive stickiness on the platform?\nOf those customers, how happy are they?\nNet Promoter Scores (NPS) are helpful here. NPS is a survey question that asks how likely you are to recommend this product on a scale of one to ten. The number has limited use, but it can signal the health of a segment in the total.\nNPS is powerful when you segment your users. \nIf you segment your users, you have a great way to understand who likes your product and those who don’t. The promoters (9-10), like it, represent an opportunity to get case studies. The detractors (0-6) are the canary for potential issues. \nThey present themselves as opportunities to learn. Understanding what drives those users to that score will help strengthen the vision. There is also an opportunity to see what is impactful, especially as you get scores over time and see where the most significant shifts happen.Download Product Success Metrics  ➜\nThemes and Trends for the Product Vision\nWhen looking at all the data and segments, you are looking for themes. Vision isn’t about one change or another that works for lower-level strategy. You are looking to impact as large of a swath of your business as possible.\nWhen you digest the data, you’ll want to take a step back. Let the data dance in your head for a while, and you’ll notice a few prominent themes.\nSomething else should come with those themes. The business isn’t stagnant, so the data you see will be moving. These are the shifts we mentioned earlier. \nCombining both will give you something to communicate to the rest of the business. Themes are great to take back to the c-suite; it’s at a level you can discuss without getting too much into the weeds. It will color the business for them. The trends will give them the numbers to help you and the rest of the company to act.\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. Themes and trends are qual and quant working together. You need to sell the vision. Have solid and explicit themes and trends will help you do that.\nAs you take a look at the themes and trends, you’ll want to know the following:\nAre these themes impactful? \nWill they cover a material part of the business?\nAre the trends clear? \nAre they tied to metrics that are proxy metrics to the health of the company?\nDo the themes and trends match? \nWe need to tell a story. \nLooking at the changes for the year isn’t enough. You’ll need to tell a cohesive story to the product team and the rest of the business to sell your vision again. \nMeasure Product Vision with Your Product Roadmap\nProduct isn’t linear, and neither is our vision. \nYour vision mustn’t become stale – business moves fast. As a product leader, you’ll need to ensure that you don’t make the mistake of assuming the vision is evident.\nTaking the time to go over the last year is essential. You need to check in on the changes, north star, failures, and segments. It would be best to sell what you see to the rest of the business with themes and trends. \nThe end of the year provides an excellent time to reevaluate what your team has accomplished.\nYour roadmap, driven by ProductPlan, is a great way to tell the story. That is why it is best to support that roadmap with a vision to drive organizational change.\nRemember, your vision is a tool to help people understand. Take the data from this research to find the connective tissue past the features and tell the story. \nYour vision is the big picture, and taking time to reflect on reinforcing your product story is valuable. As a leader, it’s a skill that will be useful throughout your career.\nSo take advantage and set yourself up for looking forward over time. Get up and see the potential around the corner.\nDiscover what ProductPlan has to offer.

Knowing your baby is the driving engine behind the entire company’s success puffs up our egos and makes our jobs seem more important than ever.\nBut unless your company offers paid services along with its line of products, how is this different from “regular” growth? And what does it mean for the product leaders steering the ship and plotting out roadmaps?\nWes Bush of the Product-Led Institute has literally written the book on product-led growth and joined ProductPlan co-founder Jim Semick on a recent webinar to discuss this and other related topics.\nWhat is Product-Led Growth?\nThe traditional sales model for almost anything is a potential customer interacting with a salesperson. That salesperson may have proactively reached out to the prospect or they might have strolled into a showroom or called up the vendor themselves.\nRegardless of who initiated the interaction, the model is one where the salesperson is driving the conversation. They’re assessing what the prospect is looking for, what problems they’re trying to solve, and the overall context of the potential purchase.\nThe salesperson is also doing a lot of education as they tout various features and functionality, reference other satisfied customers, and highlight the ease of use or simplicity of implementation and integration. Whether it’s a new car, ERP software, or a timeshare, they’re doing most of the talking.\nProduct\nIn a product-led model, it’s the potential buyer that is leading the charge. They’re actively seeking a solution, shopping around to explore their options, doing their own research, and ultimately experiencing the product before they ever plunk down their credit card or issue a purchase order.\nIn these cases, the product is essentially selling itself. Prospects try it out, see how it works, and eventually make their own decision whether to convert their trial to purchase or upgrade to a paid tier of service.\nGrowth\nThe “growth” part of product-led growth kicks in via the scalability of this model. It would take an army of salespeople to call on all these potential customers, walk them through the value proposition, and hold their hand while they try it out.\nBut when you’re trying to close dozens or hundreds of thousands of deals per week, the salesperson-driven model falls apart. It’s simply too expensive to grow at the desired rate and creates scenarios where the payback on the cost of acquisition is to create a sustainable, growing business. When the customers are doing most of the legwork themselves, growth happens organically and the product itself is its best spokesperson.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nWhy Product-led Growth is Having A Moment\n“Whether it’s your cellphone, your Internet, everything in tech is deflationary. That means consumers want to pay less for your software tomorrow,” Bush said.\nWhile this has always been the case with any new technology, the low barrier to entry in today’s marketplace has greatly accelerated the trend. That means it’s much cheaper to start new companies and attack both existing and emerging markets.\n“It’s easier to start your business, but it’s harder to grow,” Bush added, referencing the fact that the cost of acquisition has increased 50% during the past five years.\nSimultaneously, there’s been a distinct change in shopping behavior. “The buyer has changed. We prefer to self-educate,” Bush said, referencing research from Forrester indicating an overwhelming majority of buyers prefer to self-educate than talk to someone in sales.\nSemick echoed this sentiment, citing ProductPlan’s own experience.\n“We discovered really early on that they don’t want to have their handheld, especially by a human,” Semick said, citing the tendency of product managers to do their own research. “You can figure it out for yourself, the product speaks for you. You can discover new features in the product as you use the product.”\nThis dynamic dovetails especially well with SaaS companies that are able to offer free trials or adopt a freemium model. Letting customers “try before they buy” creates a much wider sales funnel, and the product itself is now an integral part of the buying experience.\nIs Product-led Growth a Fit for Your Product?\nIt’s still early days for product-led growth, as only 16% of the webinar’s attendees had adopted it to date. And while product-led growth isn’t a perfect fit for every product, there’s a fairly quick way to assess its viability.\nIn a nutshell, you’re choosing between three options:\n1. No touch\n100% self-service as customers can research, evaluate/try the product, and make a purchase without any interaction with company staff.\n2. Low touch\nThe sales team only reaches out after there are “product-qualified leads” that come in after a prospect has started using the product. Sales are answering questions and “closing,” but not “hunting.”\n3. High touch\nTraditional sales-led approach.\nThese models aren’t mutually exclusive, however, and there can be a mix within the same company, often based on the size of the potential opportunity. To evaluate whether or not to shift to product-led growth, Bush recommends using the four-step MOAT Framework.\nMarket Strategy:\nThe first step is defining your market strategy and how you’re trying to grow in your particular category:\nDifferentiated strategy\nYou’ve created a superior product for a specific market niche that stands apart from the current offerings. This allows you to charge a premium, but because it’s a more confusing and complex product you might need salespeople to educate prospects. For example, a real estate-specific CRM versus HubSpot.\nDominant player\nYour product is better than the competition and you can charge less for it than other offerings. In these cases, a free trial or freemium model is the only way to keep acquisition costs low enough to serve all those customers. Think Netflix or Spotify.\nDisruptive strategy\nIn this case, you’re offering a “worse” product but charging less. This doesn’t mean it’s a “bad” product, just one that doesn’t do as much as the competition because it’s aimed to serve a specific kind of need. This prevents customers from having to purchase a product that’s really overkilling for how they’ll use it, disrupting that product’s market dominance. In this case, it’s Canva for the casual user and Photoshop for the hardcore professional.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nOcean Condition:\nThe “O” in MOAT asks you to determine which kind of market you’re entering:\nBlue Ocean\nA new, uncontested market requiring lots of customer education, which necessitates sales reps to inform and cultivate.\nRed Ocean\nA vastly competitive, well-established space. Here, the product-led model is the only one that makes sense to achieve any market share or growth.\nAudience.\nNext, it’s time to determine who is being targeted during the sales process. Are you going after the buyers or the end-users? Is it a top-down sales approach or a bottom-up?\nProduct-led growth can only work when the company targets who will actually use the product.\nTime-to-value.\nFinally, you must assess how quickly a user will have that magical moment where the value all clicks. Product-led products require a quicker path to this realization.\nFor a complex B2B product, the time-to-value might take weeks or months. This can be overcome by mapping out the user journey and concentrating on how to start solving pain points faster to shorten that journey.\nAt the end of the day it all comes down to this, Bush said: “Does sales add value or is it adding friction?”\nThe Best Benefits of Product-Led Growth\nThere are many reasons to embrace product-led growth if your product passes the previous MOAT Framework test above:\nIt is not the dominant growth engine in the SaaS economy\nThe top of the sales funnel gets much wider\nIt lowers customer acquisition costs\nThe sales cycle speeds up, accelerating revenue\nGrowth is compounded versus linear\nYou can rapidly achieve growth on a global scale\nHigher revenue per employee\nGenerates better user experiences\nAny of those would be good reasons to take the leap, but Bush particularly emphasized the importance of compound growth. In a traditional sales model, each salesperson can only have a relationship with so many prospects, which means you must hire more and more salespeople to achieve any kind of exponential growth.\nHowever, in a product-led growth model, there’s no relationship between the number of salespeople and the number of closed deals. Growth comes by improving the product experience so more trials convert and by removing friction from the self-service sales process. Each incremental tweak and enhancement gets compounded month over month.\nDownload Prioritize Your Roadmap  ➜\nShow Versus Tell\nWhen done well, product-led growth comes down to the communication and execution of the value proposition. This has worked well for ProductPlan, where the product itself is experiencing organic growth within existing customer organizations.\nSemick said the increased share of wallet thanks to offering free viewer licenses. This exposes other parts of the business to ProductPlan’s roadmaps and planning boards before they even use the product themselves.\n“All of this is occurring without humans,” Semick said. “All of this is occurring because they’re having a great product experience.”\nBush recommends the UCD model for successful product-led growth:\nUnderstand your value\nCommunicate it to the market\nDeliver it\nThis multifaceted process views the product experience along three axes:\n1. Functional\nWith this product, the user can do something specific\n2. Emotional\nUsing this product makes them feel a particular, positive way\n3. Social\nUsing this product (or completing the tasks this product facilitates) positively influences how the user is perceived by others.\nProduct Roadmaps: Planning Your Strategy\nOnramps to Shift to Product-led Growth\nNot every organization has the opportunity to begin with a clean slate, but even existing products can pursue this approach. Bush highlighted new product launches and product line extensions as the prime candidates to start this journey, rather than converting an existing product to this model.\nHe recommends trying out both freemium and free trial models and then following one with the other SaaS pricing model. In practice, this would be either offering a limited version of the product with the opportunity to try out the fully-featured paid version for a limited time or starting with that free trial and then downgrading users to the limited free version after an initial period of time.\nBoth of these approaches give users a free taste of what a paid experience would look like while retaining those customers for the long term, even if they’re not paying for anything right now. This provides further opportunity to convert them to paying customers down the line, perhaps as new features and functionality are introduced that they’d be willing to pay for.\nTo learn more about how to shift to product-led growth and whether it’s the right fit for your company, watch the entire webinar for free or tune into the ProductLed Institute’s podcast episode featuring Jim Semick.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/shift-to-product-led-growth/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925736350,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"I'm Predictable in an Agile Environment","text":"\n “Being Agile” and “being predictable” may seem mutually exclusive, at least when it comes to product management. A good sprint cadence creates a predictable frequency of software releases but divining what’s actually in them feels harder. Isn’t the whole point of Agile that we can continuously adjust, making on-the-fly tweaks to seize opportunities? Contrary to some prevailing opinions, managing products in an Agile environment doesn’t mean surrendering planning to the whims of the development team. In fact, Agile can help you be more predictable in some ways. I say this speaking from personal experience. I’m predictable in an agile product environment.\nAgile ≠ Chaos\nThose unfamiliar with Agile often have some misconceptions about how it really works. Let’s start by dispelling a few Agile myths:\nAgile is a free-for-all.\nDevelopers don’t code what they feel like, and the software doesn’t just ship at random points of time. Agile is merely empowering the product development team to make iterative progress while adjusting to incoming data.\nProduct managers don’t have a role in an Agile environment.\nProduct managers are still prioritizing features, gathering and synthesizing customer feedback, defining a strategy and product vision, and offering input to the implementation process. None of these tasks go away. You’re no longer writing lengthy product requirements documents with the same exacting detail as before. But developers still both need and value your input.\nDates don’t matter.\nAgile certainly embraces a more fluid approach to project management. But if something needs to ship by a specific date, there’s nothing in the Agile Framework preventing it. In fact, by iteratively developing the software over multiple sprints, chances are the desired functionality will ship with fewer defects. Unlike in the waterfall model, it’s reviewed numerous times during the process.\nThere’s no visibility into what’s happening.\nWith waterfall, there are often project plans detailing what every resource is doing all the time. Anyone can take a peek and know precisely what folks are up to and how things are progressing. This type of visibility may be murkier during the actual sprint, but that’s not the case before and after. Setting sprint goals before a single line of code is written, and retrospectives (or micro-retrospectives) provides an opportunity to dig into what transpired and improve things going forward.\nPlans are useless as everyone chases the latest shiny object.\nFirst of all, once a sprint begins, what the team is working on for those two or three weeks shouldn’t change. The sprint goals remain locked. However, if something new does come up, the sprint planning team (including the product manager) can decide whether it’s worth altering the course for future sprints.Download the Anatomy of a Product Launch ➜\nApplying Agile Values to Product Management\nThe Agile Manifesto has four core values. These Agile Values are the central tenets that drive everything else. Looking at each one, we can see their potential to make product management (and product managers) more predictable in agile environment.\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\nAt first glance, you may already be scratching your head. How does this make a product manager more predictable? But note that this value uses the word “over” and NOT “instead of.”\nThere is still plenty of room for tools and processes. Agile needs those to be in place to avoid developers idling and things from getting out of hand. But it also elevates the importance of communication and addressing stakeholder concerns.\nBy creating more frequent dialogue, there is an increased level of transparency; when people know what’s happening and why they can better predict what’s to come. There’s no black box, no guessing about when things might ship.\nIn an Agile world, things may change a little more often. But everyone will also know about changes much faster and understand any potential ramifications.\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nBy removing the requirement for, well, detailed specifications, teams can deliver updates and new functionality faster. This process shortens the distance from prioritization to ship date.\nWhen there are fewer hoops to jump through and hurdles to clear, it’s easier to predict availability. After deciding to build, product managers should have a solid sense of when things will debut. They can then provide clear communication to coworkers and stakeholders.\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\nCustomer-centric companies are committed to doing everything with the best interest of customers in mind. They’re continually processing user feedback and turning those requests and complaints into a better product.\nGuess what gets in the way of that kind of responsive, ongoing progress? Having to renegotiate a contract every time something changes. When the lawyers get involved, there’s no telling how long things can get held up.\nRemoving those entanglements lets teams focus on building a great product. It removes this common source of uncertainty from the equation.\nCustomers need to pay for things, and a contract might be required. But Agile-friendly companies structure those agreements, so they don’t hinder innovation and iteration.\nResponding to change over following a plan\nOf the four values, this one seems the most contentious with our thesis. Plans make things predictable, don’t they?\nWell, executing a plan properly is predictable. But while the plan’s elements are predictable, you can’t always predict what transpires after a product ships.\nAdoption, usage, churn, reviews, net promoter scores… there’s no way to know what’s going to happen until it happens. If you’re operating with an inflexible long-term plan, it’s hard to adjust based on the product’s reception. When the cruise ship is chugging along, it’s tough to change course.\nThe best part of Agile is being able to measure, learn, and adjust. That means plans must be a little more dynamic instead of plotting out every single move for the next 18 months. That’s why roadmapping is a predictable product manager’s best tool for managing expectations and hitting target goals while still utilizing the benefits Agile has to offer.\nGet Strategic Project Alignment ➜\nThe Art of the Agile-Friendly Roadmap\nOne reason some product managers can turn negative toward Agile is that their “capstone” project (the product roadmap) might seem at odds with the framework’s fluidity. Well, if your product roadmap is chock full of particular features and exact dates, then you’d be well within your rights to be frustrated.\nHowever, including that level of detail and specificity isn’t the only way to build a roadmap. We’d argue that approach isn’t doing anyone any favors, including product managers.\nFeature-Less Roadmap\nInstead, product roadmaps featuring goals and themes are usually a much better way to go. Themes illustrate what parts of the product will be worked on at different times, along with the desired outcomes of those efforts. You can escape the trap of promising features and dates—which are inevitably destined to change in an Agile environment—while still communicating the direction and priorities for the product.\nIf there’s concern that a feature-less roadmap is too vague and open to interpretation, add milestones as specific scheduling targets. This change doesn’t guarantee a particular feature will be available by a specific date, but it conveys that you’ll reach a goal by that time.\nRemember, a roadmap’s primary purpose is communicating a vision for how the product strategy will become a reality. Implementation details and schedules aren’t required to build stakeholder alignment.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nGetting on Board with Agile\nWe get that Agile can sometimes feel like it’s taking control away from product managers and handing over more power and decision-making to the implementation side of the house. But wary PMs should take comfort in a few Agile principles that simplify their ultimate goal of delighting customers.\n#1) Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Customer satisfaction is the first principle of Agile. Not “building cool stuff” or “unshackling the creativity of our development team.”\n#2) Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. We used to throw requirements “over the wall” and see how things shook out. But the ongoing dialogue between product and development should result in products meeting expectations and delivering customer value. Moreover, you get the chance to stick your nose into things every day!\n#3) The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face communication. We mean, you might need to attend daily standups. But it also means you’re not spending as much time writing lengthy documents no one ever reads. You can continually assert yourself as the business owner and voice of the customer.\nYou can be Predictable in Agile\nReady to learn even more about how Agile and product management can not only coexist but simultaneously thrive?

Or an idea might come directly from your customers who ask for specific improvements to your product.\nBut ideas alone don’t make a product strategy. Adding every feature request or new idea from a vocal stakeholder onto your roadmap is a quick way to become a feature factory. So while capturing and organizing ideas is certainly step one, it can’t end there.\nWe wrote more about our approach to helping you turn feedback into strategic product decisions late last year. The takeaway being that there needs to be an established process that helps you decide whether possible solutions will drive desired company outcomes.\nThis is the Product Discovery process in a nutshell. Develop a profound understanding of your customers, then use that knowledge to build vital products. Without a way to capture and compare possible solutions for the same opportunity, product teams are unable to make prioritization decisions confidently. Everything becomes a priority. And when everything is a priority, nothing is.\nSound familiar?\nHow ProductPlan Helps\nProductPlan’s Product Discovery tool has two main spaces. The first is a dedicated Ideas space for you to capture and manage customer feedback, feature requests, and more. Ideas can be submitted directly by internal stakeholders with the right permissions, or by customers via private intake form. This helps you control the influx of ideas, focusing on quality over quantity.\nThe second is an Opportunities space designed to help you uncover the work that will make the biggest impact on your business.\nOpportunities help you bridge the gap between your strategy and the ideas you collect. Use opportunities to outline possible strategic priorities for your team. Then, assign the ideas that could help you accomplish each priority you identify.\nWith opportunities, you finally have a place to document your strategy, compare opportunities, and define what success looks like. Opportunities are also a great way to keep your ideas organized.\nFinally, we want to make sure you can easily move validated priorities from your Discovery space over to your ProductPlan roadmaps. In a few clicks, you can connect opportunities to relevant bars and containers in your roadmap.\nGetting Started\nEnterprise plan customers can get started today by logging into ProductPlan and heading over to the new Discovery space by clicking on the ‘lightbulb’ icon in the top right menu.\nFor non-Enterprise customers, request a demo by clicking on the button below.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/introducing_product_discovery/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925743349,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Launch Management: A Tour of ProductPlan's New Solution for Bringing Products to Market","text":"\n The ugly truth is product launches are a messy business. At times, they can be overwhelming, impossible nightmares. There are launch activities to track, expectations to manage, and stakeholders to hold accountable. Product teams carry this burden alone without the help of proper tooling.\nLaunch Management is a first-of-its-kind tool for product teams that helps you wrangle the chaos of a product launch. We are incredibly excited to show you how you can guarantee launch readiness, all within a single platform. For more, check out our guided product tour of Launch Management functionality provided below.\nToday our Launch Management solution enters General Availability as an exclusive Enterprise Plan feature set. For our ProductPlan customers, if you have questions about our pricing plans or want to see a demo, you can reach out to your Customer Success Manager, or you can schedule a demo here.\nOr, if you’re new to ProductPlan and want to try everything we offer, including best-in-class roadmapping and tailored launch planning, you can also sign up for our two-week free trial.\nBut first, let us take a step back and explain how we realized the opportunity for launch management.\nSo why did we build Launch Management?\nAsk any product manager about their launch process, and you will likely hear something like this: “It’s a nightmare. There’s no standard process for go-to-market. It’s confusing for everyone.” \nOr maybe something like this: “It’s a nightmare. I’ve never worked for a company that had an airtight GTM process. There’s always a stakeholder who wants to be more in the loop and says there isn’t enough communication.”\nOr even this: “Lol, what launch process?” \nDisclaimer: These are all actual statements our customers made when we spoke to them about their launch process!\nProduct managers are some of the most organized people in the world. They must be to rally their entire organization around the product strategy successfully. So it’s telling that such a critical piece of the product strategy—its execution—is described as a trainwreck.\nHowever, it’s not their fault. Launching a new product or feature requires the complex orchestration of multiple moving pieces. It extends beyond the product and engineering teams to include marketing, sales, customer success, legal—the list goes on. It’s one of the few instances where an entire organization collaborates to do a single project simultaneously. Of course, it’s a mess.\nLearn how to transform your product launches from chaos to success➜\nWhat challenges does Launch Management solve?\nMany of our customers spoke candidly about their challenges with inconsistent and disorganized launch processes. Our research discovered three core challenges at the heart of the problem.\n1. Lack of visibility across teams\nThere is no single place to check the status of an upcoming launch and any deliverables it requires. Instead, that information is often scattered across documents and minds, spanning teams and, at times, entire departments. To uncover what needs to be done next is to go on a scavenger hunt. The result is wasting valuable time and fraying nerves.\n2. Building manual, time-intensive reports to access launch progress\nMany product managers are stuck building manual, time-intensive reports to assess launch progress and identify loose ends. Time spent here is time spent away from work product managers want to be doing: talking with customers and collaborating with their dev teams to build new cool things.\n3. Inconsistent and disorganized launch processes\nAnd finally, the ad hoc, figure-it-out-as-we-go nature of these proceedings means no two launches follow the same process. Instead, launches are inconsistent and disorganized. Repeating successful launches isn’t easily done. Failed launches have no easy answer to the question, “why didn’t this work?” And every new launch must start from scratch.\nIn many cases, stakeholders involved in the launch aren’t clear on expectations and therefore default to peppering the launch leader with the dreaded “so what should I do next?” question. Instead of distributing mutual ownership of the launch among all relevant stakeholders, the lion’s share of the responsibility rests with the product team. If the product team doesn’t make sure it happens, it simply doesn’t.\nThe problem with status quo solutions\nThese challenges haven’t had great solutions. Yes, you can build a launch process on a house of cards using spreadsheets, slide decks, and a jumbled array of documents. But that leaves you chasing the work when you’d rather be directing the strategy.\nTo make matters worse, there are no purpose-built tools for launching a new product.\nThere are plenty of tools that help you organize a project. They might allow you to plan deliverables, assign owners, and create due dates—all of which are useful in planning a product launch. But it’s rare for tools like these to be managed by the product team, and they never live alongside other important pieces of the product puzzle, like the roadmap.\nA launch process that’s severed from the product strategy is a dangerous thing. It encourages messy handoffs while creating unintended silos.\nIdeally, your product vision will carry from your roadmap to the launch plan. You want every deliverable created—whether a marketing asset, a sales talk track or a customer support article—to demonstrate a firm understanding of the “why” behind the product. If you create these deliverables in a silo, it’s less likely they will leverage important pieces of product knowledge. They may not empathize with key customer pain points, for instance, or show little understanding of the target audience.\nThe cost of a bad launch\nIt’s difficult to overstate the cost of a bad launch. There is, of course, the opportunity cost to the product team when things break down. Instead of doing more important work, they must play the role of project manager and hold things together for their go-to-market team.\nOccasionally, a launch cobbled together on the fly like this is a success. Even if the road was a painful one. The cost of product diverting their attention to wrangle the chaos might not be felt until later when it becomes clear other opportunities slipped by the wayside while the product team had their hands full.\nBut more likely, a bad launch means, well, a bad launch. That means your product isn’t being pushed by your enablement team or sold by the sales team because there was no clear direction or ownership over key deliverables. A bad launch might result in poor customer awareness of the new thing you’ve built or, perhaps worse, a betrayal of customer expectations. A bad launch can also result in a delayed launch, meaning less time on the market, generating revenue for the company.\nOverall, a launch that flops is painful for everyone involved. It takes a cut from sales expectations. In addition, it hampers the marketing team’s ability to bring in new leads. It steals a vital tool away from customer success in their fight against churn. This reflects poorly on the product team, who tragically may have built the perfect product. The launch just didn’t do it justice.\nThankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way! Let’s dive into an overview of ProductPlan’s new Launch Management solution.\nA guided tour of Launch Management\nTo ensure every launch is a winning launch, you now have Launch Management. With our solution, you can:\nCreate thoughtful launch strategies that your entire team can get behind\nBuild tailored plans for each launch, assign due dates, and assess progress\nWhile creating shared ownership of your go-to-market process\nThe Launch Dashboard: Ditch the hassle of weekly launch reports\nWelcome to the Launch Management Dashboard. This is your 10,000-foot view of all upcoming launches in a single place. We designed the Dashboard to wrangle together all the important details you need to see at a glance about every launch you have planned.\nUse the Dashboard to see all upcoming launches and their respective launch dates. You can also use the Dashboard to track progress on individual launches, which is calculated automatically according to the percentage of completed deliverables in the Launch Checklist (more on that later).\nBased on the progress of your launch and its launch date, you can assign each launch a status: low risk, medium risk, high risk, or launched.\nWhile the Launch Dashboard is fantastic for helping you and your team stay organized in your go-to-market planning, it’s also the perfect place to send executive stakeholders whenever they come sniffing around asking for an update. It houses everything the curious senior executive needs to feel “in the know” about your launch strategy.\nAnd as a bonus, it allows you to sidestep having to create manual, time-intensive reports every week.\nThe Launch Checklist: Manage the launch strategy, not the work\nThe Launch Checklist is where a product launch comes together. A successful launch includes a tailored array of deliverables. In some cases, the list may be small. It might only include release notes, a new section in a product support article, and a slide for the sales team.\nOther launches might require the kitchen sink. In either case, for a new product or feature to land successfully in your customers’ laps, you need other members of your organization to pitch in and help support.\nWe designed the Launch Checklist for this purpose. Many product people we work with described how the handoff between the release of a new product and its launch often felt like tossing items over a fence, hoping others would be on the other side to receive them and run. You have complete visibility into every task required to see a launch through to success with the Launch Checklist.\nThe Launch Checklist has a few purpose-built tools to help you do this. Each item added to the Launch Checklist has a place for a brief description, a due date, and an owner. So, you can assign anyone in your account (both editors and viewers) as a deliverable owner. Upon assigning, that person receives an email alerting them to the required task.\nThe goal is to create co-ownership of the launch. We’ve heard many horror stories of the one-person launch, where someone on the product team ends up holding the launch together through sheer force of will (likely complimented by a disorganized flurry of ad hoc meetings and one-on-one Slack conversations).\nThese kinds of launches unravel quickly and come at a significant opportunity cost to the product team, who end up playing project manager and dealing with all the questions from confused stakeholders.\nInstead, the Launch Checklist can be your central place to plan a launch tailored to the released product or feature and get buy-in early from your cross-functional partners. And if you give your cross-functional team editor permissions, it’s also a great best practice to have them help you determine which deliverables you commit to as a team.\nConsider delegating the customer communication plan to a marketing or customer success person. Have your sales engineer come up with any deliverables needed to train your sales team on how to demo a new feature. These are great ways to encourage others to feel a sense of ownership over the launch. You’ll need their expertise to help guide your new product to market.\nAll this might beg the question: what should go into your Launch Checklist? There are no hard and fast rules. Every launch will be different and depend on the product itself, your customers, and your organization’s makeup. That said, you can find 20 great ideas for your next product launch checklist here to help get you started.\nConnect your launch plans to your roadmap\nOne of the benefits of having your launch plan in the same platform as your roadmap is it helps ensure your product vision influences your go-to-market deliverables. We make this easy with the “Features Included in the Launch” module found to the left of your Launch Checklist.\nYour roadmap houses all kinds of helpful information about your product. Many of our customers use their roadmap to document their roadmap strategy (what they’re building and when) and the why behind the features they prioritize. They will add context to the descriptions within their bars and often link to essential assets like objective documents or customer-facing collateral.\nThis information is gold for anyone planning a marketing campaign or coming up with sales talk tracks to support the launch. Adding features to your launch allows cross-functional partners easy access to what is on deck for the release and the vital context fueling it. It also encourages team members outside of the product team to read your roadmap because the information there is now actionable.\nThe connection works both ways. From your ProductPlan roadmap, you can also assign an individual bar or container to a specific launch in Launch Management, allowing you to quickly switch between your strategy and your execution plan with a click.\nTry Launch Management today!\nLaunch Management is available as a part of our Enterprise plan and our two-week free trial. If you’d like to learn more, schedule 45 minutes with us, and we’ll tailor a demo to your unique launch goals and challenges.\nWe’re looking forward to turning your next product launch into a success!\nGet your product idea launched➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/launch-management-solution/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925781196,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Lead with Context, Not Control","text":"\n Acquiring a consensus on product direction remains the number one challenge for product professionals, according to ProductPlan’s 2021 State of Product Management Annual Report. The art of product leader communication relies on the concept of responsibility without authority. Product managers who follow this concept understand the responsibility to influence others to achieve the organization’s product goals.\nThe dynamic turns upside down as we progress through our careers and establish ourselves as product leaders. As product managers, we have the power to task others with responsibilities. We need to convince stakeholders in other departments to buy into strategies and get things done.\nThe responsibility of managing a product team gives us a type of control that we’re not used to. We can give orders and hold people accountable, and we also have the authority to assign our direct reports with tasks.\nBut should we treat our direct reports differently than our other coworkers and colleagues? Should we skip the niceties and consensus building within our own teams just because we can?\nProduct Manager’s Control of Employee Expectations\nWith your team, no one can stop you from giving orders and micromanaging staff. As a product manager, implementing an effective product strategy should remain a priority. Though you may have authority, it remains crucial that you wield this power responsibly.\nRemember your time as a junior team member or individual contributor. The product managers who provided clarity around expectations and responsibilities empowered their employees. In contrast, those who failed to exude product leader communication let their product team down. As a junior product team member, what you were looking for was the “why.” The “why” provided you the context to think and act strategically versus tactically. Now that the roles have switched, you want to set up your product team for success, by developing your own product leader communication strategies.\nBy leading with context versus control, you position yourself to empower your staff to complete their tasks and reach their objectives. Autonomy provides employees with the freedom to solve problems and accomplish tasks utilizing their processes.\nYou likely hired your team members because you believed they had a good head on their shoulders and the ability to fulfill the job responsibilities. After they get fully onboarded, you can tap into those abilities.\nWhen you grant your employees some level of autonomy, you convey to them that they have your trust. Trust can go a long way towards mitigating any cases of imposter syndrome and boosting employee confidence.\nDownload Prioritize Your Roadmap  ➜\nLeading with context instead of control.\nProduct managers who provide context instead of control open up the possibilities of potential solutions. If you’re always offering basic action plans, you’re limiting your product team’s creativity. When you close off avenues that might be worth exploring, you ultimately miss out on opportunities that can lead to a better product.\nFinally, leading with context means you create alignment within your own team. You must ensure that you provide consistent messaging to external stakeholders. As a united front, you can then start tackling product initiatives. Your product team needs to understand the rationale and motivations for these initiatives and decisions.\nPlenty of opportunities exist to lead your team. By empowering them with knowledge, you refrain from bogging them down with directives.\nRecognizing the 0pportunities to lead your team.\nFor example, let’s say you have a disgruntled customer bugging you to add a new feature. The request falls within the domain of an associate product manager. You could use a command approach: (1.) directing them to write up user stories based on sales team and customer services notes. (2.) Follow up to make sure it gets prioritized.\nIn contrast, the alternative approach calls for you to lead with context. To achieve this, you can tell the associate PM that a particular customer may need more attention than a returning customer. You need to emphasize that they should do some research to understand the customer’s true pain points. The overall goal to solve and recommend one or more solutions permits them to do some real product management work.\nThe customer’s request for a feature may relate to a symptom of a whole other issue, such as a lack of training. An effective product professional understands a small tweak takes less time than weeks of work. These revelations wouldn’t happen if you simply handed down a direct order from a project manager to an associate PM.\nLikewise, you can also be less prescriptive with how junior team members spend their time by emphasizing context over control. Moreover, you can provide them with adequate context to make those decisions for themselves.\nUtilizing metrics to measure success.\nIn addition, product managers—who understand the metrics used to define and gauge success—can identify the gaps themselves and add value where they see opportunity. It puts the onus on them to consult with colleagues to see where they might need some extra help. Moreover, they can review the overall situation and identify the areas that require an active owner.\nIf you take a holistic approach, junior staff can see the big picture and their contributions for maximum impact. While this may be too much leeway for newly hired staff, a solid contributor should quickly discern where they can do the most good.\nSetting the Stage for Successful Context-Based Leadership\nContext-driven management requires two key ingredients—clarity and communication. As any veteran product leader knows, there’s no better tool to facilitate that than the product roadmap.\nA theme-based roadmap articulates the initiatives that need prioritization. Roadmaps can also convey the intended outcomes, objectives, and goals the plan expects to achieve. An effective product roadmap can align stakeholders and provide an appropriate framework for managing your team.\nWith a firm understanding of the roadmap, the entire product team operates from the same foundation by utilizing product software to remain in sync. In addition, the roadmap acts as a starting point where any decisions or conversations can provide context for the team.\nProduct managers may have a hard time loosening the reins. For this reason, product managers need to develop their product leader communication skills. Frequent check-ins and updates can ease the discomfort you may have with letting go of some of that control. In addition, if the guidance fails to provide them enough context, you can ask them questions before they jump back.\nCreating an environment where the product team remains steeped in context ensures that the product team does not lose the product narrative. The entire team can play a role by remaining curious and seeking advice.\nSpend Time on What Matters Most\nWe know from our 2021 State of Product Management report that product managers dislike mitigating issues through a reactive process instead of implementing a strategic process. Context-driven leadership can change that dynamic by forcing even the most junior members of the product team to think strategically.\nThis mindset can also inform your hiring strategies as well. Leading with context only works when you have staff members capable of synthesizing information and making sound choices independently and not just blindly following detailed instructions.\nYou may feel uncomfortable giving up control, but part of your job responsibility includes letting your team blossom and maximizing their potential. This concept mirrors the same basic tenet that underlies the entire Agile framework, where developers mitigate problems by developing solutions. Plus, it will give you more time to focus on strategic thinking, which 96% of product leaders say they don’t have enough time for.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-leader-communication/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925760978,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Lean Market Validation: 10 Ways to Rapidly Test Your Startup Idea","text":"\n This article outlines the advice I gave students and includes updates on some of the concepts to my current thinking on lean market validation. For many first-timers with great ideas, the process is exciting but also a bit intimidating. I believe that the tactics can help both entrepreneurs and product managers launch better products with a higher chance of succeeding in the market.\nSo, What is Lean Market Validation?\nWhat is market validation? It’s a question I hear a lot, especially when mentoring newer entrepreneurs and product managers.\nMarket validation is the process of determining whether your product is of interest to a given target market. Market validation involves a series of customer interviews with people in your target market, and it almost always takes place before you’ve made a significant investment in your product/concept.\nThe goal for my talk at Startup Weekend was simple: To lay out a few practical tips for entrepreneurs to quickly validate their ideas. I also wanted to help them understand that even first-time entrepreneurs can launch successful products by taking a few easy (and often free) steps.\nAfter using lean market validation to launch several software products, including ProductPlan, I’ve discovered that with the right process, even inexperienced entrepreneurs can bring exceptional products to market with excited buyers on the first day.\n10 Ways to Rapidly Test Your Startup Idea\nHere are my tips for using lean market validation to confirm whether you have a product/market fit with real customers. By simply engaging with real people and asking the right questions, you can confirm if your idea solves a problem, who your potential buyers are, and ultimately whether or not there’s a market for your product.\n1. Write down your product concept.\nJust the simple act of writing forces you to consider things you may have previously glossed over. I’m not talking about writing a “business plan.” (For startups, a business plan isn’t the best use of time and will change as soon as you start talking with prospective customers).\nI’m talking about answering a few key questions that you can go out and test. These are your assumptions, and the sooner you can test them, the less risk you will have when launching your product.\nDownload the Anatomy of a Product Launch ➜\nYou can start with the questions below or use a tool such as the Business Model Canvas to guide your thinking.\nWrite down some basic assumptions that you can go out and test:\nWho is your customer? If you say “everyone,” you are already setting yourself up for a tough time. Be sure to get specific. For example, if your customer is a business, answer: What kind of business? How big or small is the typical business? In a particular market? What is the title of the buyer?\nWhat problems are you solving? Many entrepreneurs think about the product first — they fret about the features, launch the product, and then wonder why their product has trouble getting traction. My suggestion is to start with the problem first. What this means is being explicit about the problems your product solves. By writing down these problems, you can validate whether customers also see them as problems. And, more importantly, whether customers think they are problems worth solving.\nHow does your product solve those problems? Only after writing down the problem do you move to the product. From here, you tie the value of your product directly back to customer problems. How does solving their problems make their life better? Does it make them more money? Look better?\nWhat are the key features of the product? The features need to be more than cool — they need to solve specific problems—the more quantitative (e.g., time saved, money made), the better. I encourage you to think Minimum Viable Product and limit the feature set as much as possible (you need to provide just enough value for some customers to buy).\n2. Decide.\nAt Startup Weekend, 54 hours go quickly. The same concept holds for startups and new products in the real world. Time and resources are scarce. There isn’t time to agonize over details that, in the end, may not matter.\nFor that reason, lean market validation helps successful teams get just enough information and data to make decisions. And then they make them. I like to adhere to the 80% rule — get just enough (valid) information from customer interviews and other data sources and then decide. In the end, you will never get to 100% certainty, and getting close will eat up an excessive amount of time.\n3. Most of what you write down are assumptions.\nThis brings me to my third point: All the writing you do, the discussions (and debating) you have, are assumptions. Teams often take these discussions (and what’s in their heads) as facts when they are simply assumptions that need to be tested.\nI like to think of the scientific method when reviewing ideas — how can they be tested?\nI often see teams (at Startup Weekend and at startups) debate minor details, waste valuable time rather than make a guess (a temporary decision), and then get out into the real world to test whether it’s the right idea. It’s essential just to make a guess and get started because your assumptions may turn out to be wrong, and you’ll have spent valuable time (not to mention the toll on team dynamics) debating something that didn’t matter in the first place.\n4. Find the truth by getting out to test your assumptions.\nAs soon as you’ve made some basic decisions, and written down your assumptions, get out to test them to see if they resonate with potential customers. I encouraged Startup Weekend attendees to get out on the street and save valuable time by getting on the phone if the customer type warrants.\nLean market validation relies on customer interviews with potential buyers of your product. You can also test your assumptions by interviewing experts (for example, analysts for the industry, people who have been employed by the industry, consultants, etc.). There are also some great ways to test digital ideas with landing pages and inexpensive ads.\nDownload the Product-Market Fit Book ➜\n5. Start with your network.\nI’m often asked how teams can easily find prospects to speak with. I recommend working with your own network and the networks of friends, mentors, investors, and others to reach potential customers.\nThe downside of interviewing people in your network is they are friendly to your cause. This means that you are introducing some potential bias into your learning. But my attitude is that some bias is better than not interviewing and getting closer to the truth.\n6. Interview your customers.\nWhen I mention interviewing, I’m not talking about a cursory conversation (or worse, a survey). Start with a list of questions but deviate from the questions as you learn more information. Approach the conversation with a sense of curiosity about the customer’s problem and needs, and you’ll get some really valuable insight.\nDownload our Customer Interview Tool Box, including templates you can use to track your interviews.\n7. Ask, “Why?”\n“Why?” is by far the most important question you can ask. With it, you can get closer to the truth from customers. Unfortunately, this question isn’t used often enough — too many people ask a question and then take the answer at face value. It’s a missed opportunity to understand motivation and validate what someone would really do.\nThe Five Whys is a great technique for getting to the underlying reason — the real reason — behind a customer’s motivation.\n8. Find the value proposition.\nI encourage entrepreneurs to focus less on features and more on explaining the value proposition for their product. What does that mean? A value proposition is the expected gains that a customer would receive from using your product. Value can be quantitative, such as time saved or additional revenue earned. Measuring this is usually straightforward.\nBut value can also be qualitative, such as pain relief or lifestyle benefits your product provides. By thoroughly understanding and documenting this qualitative value through customer interviews, you can set your product apart from the competition.\nFor example, it could be time saved, more revenue, or maybe some social benefit (like looking good). Whatever it is, these value propositions are directly tied to the problems that you have previously discovered.\n9. Liking your idea is not the same as buying your product.\nUnfortunately, validating a product idea with prospective customers is subjective. There is no black and white answer. In fact, because people are generally nice and want to please you (especially the friendly university students at Startup Weekend), you need to be careful about accepting their answers at face value.\nWhen someone tells you enthusiastically, “it sounds great,” or “that’s an interesting idea,” your first reaction should be to follow up with “why?” It’s important to understand that someone liking your idea is not the same as buying the product. Your challenge during your lean market validation process eliminates as much of these “false positives” as much as possible.\n10. Jump off the cliff and have fun!\nMy advice to the group (and all entrepreneurs) is to take a risk, jump off the cliff, and have fun with the lean market validation experience. It’s taking chances that are the hallmark of successful entrepreneurs, and using these techniques helps you get closer to success.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/lean-market-validation-10-ways-rapidly-test-startup-idea/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925749473,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Lessons from a Product Launch: Rivian","text":"\n Lessons from a Product Launch: Rivian\nAsk any product manager, and they will tell you that product launches are equal parts daunting and exciting. “Go, go, go” is the mantra, as all team members kick into high gear to get the first minimum viable product (MVP) out into the world.\nLaunching a product should be an exciting time for product managers and key stakeholders. However, it is often a daunting task because there are a lot of moving parts throughout the launch process. It includes running customer validation interviews and developing team sprints, communicating updates with internal stakeholders. And so much more!\nIt’s a lot to manage, both at a macro and a micro-level. Pretty daunting, right?\nA successful product launch provides a sense of accomplishment and excitement, despite how chaotic it first appears. That’s the situation Zack Suhadolnik, a Senior Product Designer, found himself in at Rivian—an American electric vehicle automaker and automotive technology company. “It was pretty chaotic; I’d say,” he mused. It is completely understandable, considering Rivian was simultaneously going to market with the first-ever EV truck, gearing up for their IPO, and grounding its new brand.\nZack was gracious enough to sit down with us to share his first-hand experience with Rivian’s R1T electric truck launch. We came away from the discussion with some fundamental principles that can benefit any product person managing their own respective launches.\nView Chaos as an Opportunity\nChaos—it’s a state of being that evokes images of complete disarray and a lack of process. It is a natural byproduct of a product launch of any size. Yet, we should view chaos as an opportunity to create order by streamlining the product launch process.\n“I personally thrive in the chaos [of a launch]. It’s really easy for me to pump something out fast, and I get inspired when we’re just like, ‘All right, we gotta stand this up as soon as possible.’ It sparks creativity for me.”\nDuring launches, Zack noted that things need to get done and get done fast. The need for speed sparks and generates inspiration that would not exist otherwise.\n“Creativity comes out of those less structured chaotic projects. For designers, the beginning of a project is where it’s the most fun. As soon as a project starts to get very organized and you’re starting to implement things is when I think creativity drops off.”\nWhen Zack joined the team at Rivian, there were some initial structures in place for his team, but also room for creativity. This unique freedom—given to everyone in the organization—was a boon to a designer like him.\n“If you look at a lot of other automotive industry companies, their design is all very similar, very templatized. It is clean, and it probably converts really well, but it lacks character and any sort of voice that’s different.”\nBuild your own product launch plan roadmap with our free template ➜\nStay Open, Come Together\nComplete freedom and collaboration did not just happen organically at Rivian. It’s their core principle, embodied in the mission statement, “Stay open, come together.”\nAt all levels of the company, there is a shared vulnerability that encourages employees to reiterate on ideas to make them better. Coworkers have a pride-driven “fight” instinct to redo initial versions of products. The company firmly believes everyone should have pride in their work.\nWhile collaboration is encouraged at every company, during Rivian’s launch, they took it a step further. Zack references the “storming” phase of Tuchman’s stages of group development to describe research and ideation at Rivian. During this phase, leadership and individual teams leverage as many creatives as possible to solve a problem, produce the best ideas, and prioritize the right items.\n“It’s really hard for some people to accept this strategy, and I think it takes a certain personality type to thrive in that sort of ambiguity and uncertainty. But you get to make sure that everything’s on the table, and then you can start to narrow in on what’s feeling right.”\nZack admits that this is a unique approach to Rivian, not in execution but the executive buy-in. They allow teams to bring in people early and often at the beginning of ideation and even intentionally cross-pollinate teams on the creative side. As a result, the process allows each team a broader view of their options and opportunities and keeps fresh perspectives at the forefront of their projects.\nCollaboration Doesn’t End with the Launch\nWhat happens after the product gets launched? At Rivian, they pump the brakes. Then, each team carefully works in a cross-functional way to smooth out any leftover rough edges from the launch.\n“For me personally, it’s been a very new way of working. I’ve always been so used to just owning everything. So to be vulnerable and open up has been hard, but I think it really leads to better design in the long run.”\nGroups that got siloed came together to foster further collaboration. Their goal is to move forward and align on what worked and what did not retroactively.\n3 Key Takeaways from Rivian’s Product Launch Experience\nRivian’s product launch has several key takeaways from a product perspective:\n1. Embrace the chaos of the launch, and use it to your team’s advantage.\nTap into that mix of creativity and independence to get a bird’s eye view of the problem at hand, ensuring that you have a higher chance of executing the right decision.\n2. Collaborate with anyone and everyone at the early stages of a launch.\nEarly collaboration ensures that you have good coverage on all ideas for your side of the product. Additionally, it ensures you plant the seeds of cross-functional teamwork to deal with possible siloes later in the launch. Executive buy-in can be another way to ensure the success of this collaboration.\n3. Conduct a retrospective and reach out to siloed teams post-launch.\nThe retrospective process allows your team the opportunity to align with others from a process perspective and take stock of what worked and what didn’t during the launch.\nNo product launch will turn out perfectly, but there are important learnings to be had from each launch, even those outside of a traditional software product launch. Take these findings and apply them to your next major launch!\nP.S. Have a great product launch story to share? We’d love to hear it!

Given the number of individuals, teams, and stakeholders a product manager interfaces with on a regular basis, mastering communication skills is something we should all be working on continuously. In my experience working with start-ups for the past 20 years, I’ve witnessed a lot of variance in the degree to which companies encourage employees to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses in order to identify how they can improve themselves. Often, these efforts center on communication.\nTweet This:\n“A cornerstone of being a successful product manager is effective communication, and understanding personality types can help.”\nThere are many ways to do this and, if you’re fortunate, your company has some process in place to help you. If you’d like to take things into your own hands, however, I recommend trying one of the following online assessment tools, which can help you uncover blind spots and strengths you may not even be aware of.\nThere are many different assessment tools out there, each with its own framework and methodology.\nMyers-Briggs\nMyers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI) is one of the most popular personality frameworks, having been used since 1943. This framework is based on four dichotomies: whether you’re extroverted or introverted, whether you rely primarily on sensing or intuition, whether you’re a “thinker” or a “feeler,” and whether you rely more on judgment or perception. The results are boiled down to one of 16 personality types, such as ISTJ or ENFP. My test results indicate I’m an ENTJ, which means I’m matter-of-fact, decisive, and quick to make decisions. ENTJs also excel at helping people get things done with a focus on getting results in the most efficient way possible. Sounds like a product manager, right? So do many other MBTI types.\nISTJ’s, for example, tend to be serious and earn success by thoroughness and dependability. Practical, matter-of-fact, realistic, and responsible, this also sounds like a product manager. If someone on your team is an ISTJ, she may not thrive in a chaotic, all-day brainstorming session. You may want to think of some alternative ways to solicit their input, such as having everyone write their ideas on post-it notes instead of saying them out loud. There is no right or wrong personality type. The key is to find your type and take advantage of the strengths you have.\nStrengthsFinder\nSpeaking of strengths, StrengthsFinder is another popular assessment tool. As the name implies, this test is all about finding your top strengths so you can better take advantage of them. The methodology is based on understanding which of the 34 “talent themes” best represents your strengths. My top 5 strengths are Achiever, Activator, Positivity, Futuristic, and Learner. If you didn’t know me, but read the results from the StrengthsFinder test, you probably wouldn’t be surprised to find out I’m a software product manager. Another product manager I know is a Maximizer, Strategic, Learner, Individualization, and Arranger. Sounds like a great combination for a product manager! In this case, I might ask this product manager to take the lead on conducting data analysis along with presenting it to the organization since the Arranger trait makes him well-suited to identifying patterns and trends and perceiving how things fit together.\nDISC\nDISC is another framework I recently discovered which appeals to me because of its simplicity. It’s based on answering a set of 12 quick questions about how you respond to challenges, how you influence others, and how you respond to rules and procedures. I also like how it can easily be applied to understanding what makes other people tick without already knowing whether they’re an ESTP or an Activator. DISC is a quadrant behavioral model based on these 4 personality dimensions:\nDecisive (Ds): This type is best described as direct, strong-willed, and forceful. If you’re a fan of the Seinfeld TV show, Jerry would fall into this theme with his direct, skeptical, and impatient nature.\nInteractive (Is): If you’re sociable, talkative, and lively, you’re likely an I. Another I would be Jerry’s friend, Elaine.\nStabilizing (Ss): Gentle, accommodating, and soft-hearted people are considered to be Ss, much like Kramer.\nCautious (Cs): Questioning, analytical, and stubborn types enjoy accuracy and stability. Jerry’s best friend, George, certainly comes to mind when you think of the Cs.\nOnce you know what your DISC type is (mine is D), you can easily start applying the framework to those around you. Does this require some generalization and stereotyping? Perhaps. However, it’s human nature to make judgements about people as soon as we meet them. This is rooted in our animal instincts to judge friend from foe, threat from opportunity, etc. By leveraging these insights to better understand your colleagues, you’ll be able to better communicate with them and be more successful in your product career.\nTake a moment now and think about someone on your team that you work closely with. Without giving it too much thought, which DISC type comes to mind? Once you get the hang of it, you can start using this in a more strategic fashion, such as tailoring your one-on-one meetings based on the DISC behaviors your colleague best represents. Grabbing coffee and having an informal chat would work well with an I style colleague. However, if you’re having an important meeting with an individual who is a C, then you need to prepare yourself by allowing enough time to go over the details with that person so that they can fully digest what you are presenting to them. You may even want to think about the types of questions he may ask you, since you know they tend to be questioning and analytical.\nA practical and creative use of this framework is to apply it to how you present your product roadmap to stakeholders. I always try to meet 1:1 with my stakeholders to socialize my roadmaps, to give everyone a chance to ask questions and dig deeper into what the vision is and what is driving our priorities.\nBy tailoring these roadmap socializing sessions based on the DISC personality types, you’ll be able to much more effectively communicate product direction and build consensus. For example, you could choose different roadmap templates based on who you’re meeting with. If you’re meeting with someone who’s a D style (direct, fast-paced, impatient), you may want to share a streamlined version of your roadmap with a focus on results. If you’re meeting with a C style (think of George), come prepared with a more detailed roadmap with back-up slides to address their need for understanding the analysis behind the roadmap.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nTailoring your roadmap presentations to your audience is a key to your success as a product manager. Better understanding your audience with the use of frameworks such as these can help you ensure your product has the best chance of being successful.\nHave you used other personality assessment tools?

I try to get my team similarly enthused about this endeavor. But when I check in with them in about a week, you can barely tell that anything had changed… mostly because it hadn’t.\nWe tend to fall back into how we were doing things before because that cool new process isn’t meaningful in itself. Without the context for why it’s the most important way to spend our time, it wasn’t worth investing in making a change.\nSo when I tried coming up with my own mindset and mantra for improving product management, I found myself elevating above the flowcharts and execution strategies, looking for something more universal. I wanted to tie together the entire ecosystem and to identify a unifying measuring stick. Something equally applicable to how we prioritize projects as it is to our own careers.\nMost importantly, I wanted to invest our time in something that will stick and make us all more productive and efficient product teams. Thus came the genesis of IMPACT, where six words can create a lens to reexamine everything a product professional does to ensure it truly is creating an impact and maximizing the opportunity.\nMeaningful Product Processes with IMPACT\nSolving Interesting problems that are Meaningful to People, with Actionable plans that are Clear and Testable. That’s what IMPACT’s all about, and if we’re not infusing our processes with IMPACT, then we’re potentially spending our energy on the wrong things.\nDownload IMPACT ➜\nInteresting\nBy making the problem interesting, we start to build momentum. People need a reason to care, so it’s imperative we tell stories and use our storytelling skills in everything we do. \nBy helping our audience—from sales and marketing to engineering and QA—connect with the customer problem, we will drive better outcomes. We all know that when we focus on value over features, everyone’s happier.\nThe processes with IMPACT that help ensure we’re working on interesting problems include:\nProduct discovery—Helps you better understand the customer problem and interestingly tell that story.\nIdeation & validation—Uncovers more meaning.\nMarket research—Reveals how others tell their stories and perceive the audience.\nCustomer feedback—A door into what’s happening and the trends and evolution in the market.\nCommunity involvement—Take any opportunity you can to be where your customers are and get more chances to hear their stories and the challenges they face.\nEvent participation—Talk to people and learn about their lives outside your product for invaluable context.\nMeaningful\nIs your solution meaningful to the customer or the business? Remember that excitement about an idea doesn’t always translate to value. The real test is how much they’re willing to pay for it, which truly shows how much they value the solution.\nAside from generating revenue, it’s also important to check if the solution aligns with the business’s direction, vision, and values. These processes with IMPACT can help you articulate what’s meaningful to business:\nVision & Mission—Although it’s often handed down from senior management, it still influences your work. You should be able to articulate how your solution aligns with the vision and mission. Then, prioritize things when necessary to create those connections.\nStrategy/Strategic Alignment—It should include a definition of value that the product is trying to deliver and what success looks like.\nGracefully Saying No—If that really compelling idea doesn’t create meaning, communicate that to teams and customers ASAP, then move on.\nRoadmapping—Include components of the meaning and value you’re creating, as well as why it’s the right thing to do.\nPeople\nYou must figure out the pervasiveness of the problem you’re solving and how many people will care. What will solving this problem unlock in the market?\nAlongside understanding your research in solving the problem with a specific solution, it’s also essential to know how that investment may accelerate other innovations or solve related problems. This can lead to exponential growth and new opportunities beyond the original scope and scale of the situation.\nBy using as broad a lens as possible, you can also determine if you’re making a big impact for a small number of people or a small impact for a big number of people… both of which are worthy and sound investments, assuming there’s a willingness to pay. These processes can help quantify things:\nCompetitive Analysis—Helps you understand which problems competitors are solving and how they frame them. Not to mention figuring out which ones they’re NOT solving.\nMarket research—Helpful, but determine upfront how much you need to know to be confident to move forward to avoid analysis paralysis.\nSurveys—Determine who cares about this problem and how frequently it occurs.\nJobs To Be Done/Opportunity Tree—Another tool to assess the problem’s pervasiveness and how big a deal it really is.\nPrioritization—Be sure you’re accounting for the people that will be impacted by value creation. Not catering to the whims of internal stakeholders or finicky edge cases.\nSegmentation—Use this to define your target market and zoom in on the people who will truly benefit and appreciate the value of your solution.\nActionable\nComing up with a great idea is pretty easy. Go ask a first grader, and they’ll give you some amazing, innovative ideas… that are completely unfeasible. Your job is to narrow things down to what’s possible, reasonable, and probable. \nYou need to know you can deliver the solution, regardless of how big or important the problem is. These processes can serve as a reality check on what’s truly doable:\nSquads/Team Composition—More effective teams, benefit the entire company. They must be constructed to get an optimal cross-section of talent and compatible personalities and work styles.\nProduct Development processes—Find time to evaluate feasibility and LOE as early as possible to avoid wasting cycles un impractical pathways.\nIdeation/Validation—All ideas are welcome, but only those truly actionable given how the solution is framed should be pursued.\nDependency Analysis—Larger teams, create more dependencies. Those dependencies increase the odds that the market will pass you by while you sort things out.\nClear\nTo build consensus, generate enthusiasm, and win over skeptics, you must be able to articulate the value statement of the solution clearly. This not only will help you secure resources and support for the project, but it also has a downstream impact on sales and marketing, as well as eventually how customers react to the value proposition.\nSome key processes contribute to making sure the impact of the solution is clear to everyone:\nRoadmap/Road Show—You want to make sure it’s in front of audiences frequently enough that it’s current, accurate, and remains top of mind. This is especially key when there’s not yet a lot of trust in you or your ideas. It’s also crucial to ensure the roadmap presents the right amount of information for the specific audience. You don’t want to drown them in details or rush through the items they particularly care most about.\nAlignment—You want to be sure you’re all using the same language, OKRs, prioritization, etc., so you’re all happy with the result.\nCross-Functional Collaboration—Evaluate how and when you interact with peers to be sure it’s frequent enough. These interactions should be in settings where they’ll feel heard and can have their concerns addressed.\nDocumentation—People don’t read (except amazing blog posts like this!). Is it accomplishing what you need it to do? Does it match the TLDR summary you included at the top?\nTestable\nHumans aren’t very good at knowing what they need, just articulating what they THINK they need. Therefore you must validate that the planned solution is valuable as early as possible. \nEmbrace the sunk cost philosophy early and often. Additionally, don’t be afraid to walk away or initiate a significant course correction at any stage. This is only possible by leveraging processes that put your ideas to the test:\nAgile Product Development—Agile is about more than replacing waterfall; it’s how you can test, learn, and adjust. With Agile, you can forward efficiently while leaving room for learning moments and making corrections based on those findings.\nBeta Processes—It’s never too late to learn and change. Set expectations internally and with customers while capturing feedback during beta tests. This isn’t just a dress rehearsal but rather a chance to get real-world experience on what you think will work.\nIterative Design—Boil things down to the smallest step you can take to deliver value. Then test, learn, and repeat.\nUsability Studies—You need tools to test and verify. So watching real customers try to use your product is one of the best options there is.\nFor more insights into how you can apply IMPACT to your processes, watch the webinar or download the free e-book today.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/processes-with-impact/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925749829,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Misfits, Geniuses, and Ringleaders: Why Product Management May Be Perfect for You","text":"\n This article is for recent graduates with an entrepreneurial mindset who are thinking about what would be the perfect job for them. It’s also for people thinking about moving into product management. I’m going to start with a question. Raise your hand if someday:\nYou’d like to start your own company?\nBe your own boss?\nI’m visualizing lots of hands raised out there. I mean, dang, who wouldn’t want to have their own company, be their own boss, and call the shots? For that reason, I’d like to introduce you to a job title you may not have heard of before, but that could give you some runway to practice the skills you might need to start your own company someday — while you still get a great paycheck, benefits, and learnings from a more established company. That job title is Product Manager. Here’s why product management should be your career choice.\nYou’re in great company. There are some famous people out there who were first product managers before they started being CEO. Here are just a few:\nJeff Bezos – Amazon\nKevin Systrom – Instagram\nMarissa Mayer – Yahoo\nAnd while I’m nowhere close to those three groundbreakers, I have worked at Citrix for over 14 years, leading teams developing and releasing the GoTo branded software that generates millions of dollars in annual revenue. Do I have a degree in computer science or human-computer interaction? No. What might surprise you is that I was a Liberal Arts major in college; I studied Spanish. Long story short, by taking various jobs in the software industry and constantly learning and moving up, I was able to grow my career from web designer to user interface designer to product manager. I ultimately became a product manager because of some of the skills below that I realized I always had.\nLoosely put, the product manager sets the tone for a product, understands the customer’s pain points, leads a team, takes various forms of input, and ultimately makes the product-related decisions. The elephant in this picture is the leader of the pack. It’s almost like her trunk and her feet are pointed in one direction, and as if she is saying:\n“Follow me”\n“We’re going that way.”\n“We are passionate and are we’re on a mission.”\nOk, I’ve got you to this point and so you ask, “What companies need product managers?”\nKind of a simple answer, but any company that has a product or service needs someone to truly understand the needs of its customers and to set the vision and tone for the product and for the people who work on it. In a small company of 1-20, it’s usually the founders, but at some point, the founders have other things to do and may appoint a product manager. In larger companies, there’s almost always a need for many product managers.\nQuick gut check. Searching on LinkedIn TODAY, I found (obviously subject to change on the day of search but this gives you a sense):\n1,019 Product Management jobs at Amazon\n455 at Google\n303 at Facebook\nBefore I go too far, let me just say: different companies call “product managers” different things. You find similar jobs under the following names:\nProduct Marketing Manager\nProgram Manager\nProject Manager\nProduct Owner\nUse those terms and you’ve just expanded your search 3x.\nSo now that you know what it is and what it might be called. Let’s see if it might be a fit for you.\nAre You a Ringleader? Then product management might be the career choice for you.\nPeople who like other people, who have the ability to wrangle and lead various folks, (while respecting their opinions and differences) are what I might call Ringleaders. If that’s you, take note. Ringleaders make great product managers because they:\nRecruit other passionate people who never give up to be on their team.\nEnable their teammates to shine and do their best work incorporating their feedback.\nGather champions and mentors to guide them along their product journey.\nBuy the pizza, bring the donuts, and make sure everyone is fed — literally and figuratively. If anyone needs something or is blocked, the product manager is the first one to help.\nAs servant leaders, they eat last and let others go first.\nDownload a Day in a Product Manager's Life➜\nAre You a Curious Observer of Life?\nThere are some people who love observing the curiosities of life and work. They wonder why things work a certain way and if there might be another way. This is just how they tick — all the time. If that’s you, good news: constant and relentless curiosity is the most essential tool in a product manager’s toolbox. They use it to:\nAsk a lot of questions about their customers, their teams, and the market. Why? is their favorite question.\nLean in and listen to the answers thoughtfully, without bias.\nObserve people in their natural setting (because “actions speak volumes”).\nYou’ll hear them say, “Huh, isn’t that interesting.”\nDo You See Opportunities?\nOnce you spot a problem or something that could be made better, do you instantly go into thinking, evaluating, and what-if mode, running quick calculations in your head, sketching rough ideas on the back of a napkin? Do you brainstorm with a friend asking, “How might we…?” or “What if…?” If yes, you really should think about a career in product management. Because product managers constantly:\nNarrow in and focus on the most pressing problems that offer the biggest opportunities for their customers and their companies.\nBelieve, hypothesizing the possible ways they can make a difference.\nExperiment and iterate rapidly so they can learn fast if their beliefs are true or false and how they might make their solution more irresistible.\nTell stories that are easy for anyone to comprehend and get onboard.\nBrian Scudmore founder of 1 800 Junk, $200M in annual revenue company tells his story of “seeing opportunities” his first junk removal truck. Listen to it on the “How I Built This” podcast.\nAre You Problem Maker or Problem Solver?\nAnd then there are people who don’t make problems but solve problems. They’re the first ones with an idea, a fix, or a plan. They are not phased — in their eyes, if there’s a will, there’s a way. They aren’t complainers but doers, makers, fixers, and dreamers, envisioning a better or new way. Does that sound like you? If so, product management is all about solving problems; jumping through, around, over, and under obstacles; and asking questions like:\nHow might we solve this?\nWhat’s the one standout thing that makes our solution different, better, easier, or cheaper than what is out there today?\nWhat competitive advantages do we have that we can run with?\nWhile I was at Citrix, we had the opportunity to come up with a startup app idea when the company was interested in developing lean and scrappy ideas to compete with ankle-biting startups. Along with 4 teammates, we came up with a phone app called Convoi that was targeted at everyday business people who were tired of using their personal cell phones for work but needed a mobile phone number for texting, calling, and business voicemail with clients.\nOur one standout thing was that within 15 seconds of downloading our free app, we got you any phone number in any area code. You could immediately be calling and texting from it. It was a magical experience for people.\nWe had a trusted audience from GoToMeeting that we could advertise for free.\nIn the app store, we could be a sister app to GoToMeeting that had over millions of downloads each year. We could ride that wave and get eyeballs and attention without spending a lot of money on marketing.\nWe had the advantage of being part of a large company that had resources we could use to build the app, validate it, and get it to market fast.\nWe knew the company was interested in the virtual phone system business but hadn’t yet pulled the trigger on a large scale development project.\nWe could afford to offer something as freemium to test the interest.\nWe found mentors and champions internal and external to the company to guide us on our way.\nYou Understand That You Have to Show Proof\nBecause they have so many ideas, these kind of people are anxious and want to know if their solution will work — if it will hold water. The bosses funding these projects also want to see proof that they’re on the right track. They usually come up with metrics, triggers, or tests to tell themselves and their teams whether they’re on the right track. Is that you? If so, product managers routinely ask themselves and their teams:\nHow will we know it’s working?\nWhat does success look like at certain points in our journey?\nWhat are some success metrics or numbers we hope to hit?\nIn the Convoi example above, we had some metrics we held ourselves accountable. Here were just a few of ours:\n25 interviews of our target audience saying that they had this problem and were actively looking for a solution\nTime To Value < 30 seconds\nFirst text sent/received < 5 mins\n> 5% new users per week\nNet Promoter Score > 50\n40% Daily Active Use (It was a business phone so in order for it to be successful you had to use it every week day)\nBy hitting these we knew we were on the right track.\nAre You Adaptable? Then product management might be the career choice for you.\nSome people crave change, love the challenge of it, and can turn on a dime. They actually thrive on the adrenaline. They love hard things that might not have been done before. They are on a relentless pursuit of “yes”. The word “no” doesn’t phase them for too long. “No” might be a no for today, but tomorrow the game is different. Product managers know that:\nChange will happen. Companies, plans, roadmaps, and management change.\nYou have to be willing to pivot when the data is telling you to do so.\nThey are constantly iterating and reinventing themselves.\nThey will ask and be turned down 80x. It’s part of the journey.\nThey write their own playbook when there isn’t one (which is quite often).\nThey learn from others. They figure, why reinvent the wheel?\nIn short, a product manager’s job is all about solving problems for people. If your life has led you to creative thinking, problem-solving, and curiosity, it’s quite possible product management is the perfect career choice and you’d be a perfect fit for a role where you can practice, learn and grow a ton. A role in product management will look terrific on your resume, and the learnings will be great while the risk is minimal. What’s more, you will likely earn a favorable salary (check GlassDoor for product management salaries — not too shabby) and be instilled with the confidence that you might just start your own company someday.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nAbout the Author\nCarey Caulfield (@careycaulfield) works at LogMeIn in the GoTo business division previously part of Citrix Systems in Santa Barbara, CA as a Principal Product Manager.

Flash forward fifteen years later, and I’m the Director of Product Management at HG Insights. Working in startups and big technology companies, I’ve encountered one question more than most: “How do I make the switch from engineering to product management?”\nThat’s a big question, and many roads lead to this outcome. So, what qualities does it take to become a product manager? What differences lie in the company expectations? Moreover, what are the next steps you can take to make the transition?\nMy Journey Transitioning from Engineering to Product Management\nI worked 9+ years in software development, leading sizeable cross-functional engineering teams across time zones. Then, I started gravitating towards product strategy questions, like, “Why am I building products?, Who am I building for?, What impact am I bringing to the business?, What makes startups fail or succeed in their mission?”, and so on.\nI thought Business school would be the answer, so I started preparing for it, but an exciting opportunity fell in my lap to transform a struggling product offering. Though I had no idea what I was doing before I knew it, I interviewed external customers, internal stakeholders, and various customer-facing teams to understand the problem better.\nI worked with the product leadership to plan out a product strategy. Then, I created a product roadmap to move that strategy forward, which ultimately drove a 15% increase in revenue and a 20% increase in retention. I believe in focusing on outcomes to power-up aligning your product strategy with business goals onto a roadmap.\nIt was the most satisfying moment of my career, even more than building multiple product lines. From that success, I was then officially asked to move into the product role by the product leadership, and I have not looked back since then.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\n4 Key Differences in Skills Engineer to Product Manager\nYou don’t need to have an engineering background to be a successful product manager. Anyone can learn agile product development, basics of software design and development lifecycle, etc.\nHere are the four fundamental elements product managers need that is different than engineering:\nStrong empathy for your customers (internal and external)\nStrong understanding of the business (and market)\nYou understand that your goal is to achieve business outcomes through measurable product initiatives. Your role is to identify and validate the problems, not actually to solve them.\nParticipate in every aspect of product design (not talking about just UX/UI here), but this subtle distinction is key to not lose focus on the big picture.\nIn addition to core product management skills, there are other essential intangibles to success like strong communication, cross-team alignment, being the thought leader, and always being curious.\nI shared more of my thoughts on this in the ProductPlan video series, Spotlights. Watch them below.\nWhat are the Company’s Expectations of a Product Manager?\nAs a product manager, your primary goal is to deliver business outcomes. Depending on the company, experience, team structure, and business dynamics, the expectations could vary. But any product manager not focusing on essential KPIs like active use, revenue, retention, customer satisfaction, etc. needs to take a closer look at the role. A good product manager is expected to drive strong cross-functional alignment and proactive communications to ensure everyone is focusing on the right problems.\nA wise woman once said: Product management is one of the hardest functions in the business but if done right can transform the entire business.\nEngineer vs. Product Manager Responsibilities\nThe fundamental difference product managers need to understand is that your role is to identify the right problem (business, technical, or customer) and why it is worth solving or how it drives business outcomes. In contrast, engineering is responsible for delivering the solution to that problem. Your role as a product manager is to ensure your team is working on solving problems that have a measurable impact on the business. You are also responsible for ensuring customer-facing teams like Customer Success, Marketing, and Sales are fully aware and aligned on the product roadmap.\nOf course, a team is successful only when they collaborate as “one team,” so expect to roll up your sleeves for designing the solution, testing it, providing early feedback, documentation, etc.\nHow to Transition from Engineering to Product Management\nFirst and foremost, you need to understand what product management is in your business and what they are responsible for. Every business, every team, and every market is different.\nTo be a product manager, you need to start thinking like a product manager (even before switching over). There are plenty of books, blogs, and online training to sharpen up on the responsibilities.\nThe best recommendation I can give you is to pair up with a product manager to get that hands-on experience. Start to learn how to approach a problem, define a problem, build hypotheses around solutions, collaborate with cross-functional teams to refine it, build metrics for success (or failure), and finally figure out the best and fastest way to get to market.\nThe Transition from Engineering to Product Management Timeline\nIn spite of popular belief, there are no definitive timelines, whether it’s engineering or product management. The first and most important thing is finding a company with an established product management team.\nThen, collaborate with an experienced product manager on a real project. I am personally a big proponent of the associate product manager track. That’s the best way to get your hands dirty in the game.\nLong term, you can expect to manage a specific KPI (e.g., improve first user experience, reduce churn, etc.), product offering, entire product portfolio, or product team. You have a little more flexibility in product management because you are learning various aspects of running a successful business.\nTakeaways\nMentoring and people development is a big passion of my life and gives me more satisfaction than anything else. I talk to a lot of aspiring PMs who want to be product managers because they want to be a product manager or have a very different understanding of the role. I don’t blame them because there is so much wisdom that’s out there, which could be confusing sometimes.\nBut if you like solving complex business problems and understand why and for whom, then you might like being a product manager.\nLook at your career as a marathon and not a sprint. Great products take time. Find the right business and team and learn faster than anyone else. Remember, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/transition-engineering-product-leadership/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925780907,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Patterns of Pain: How Product Managers Solve High-Value Problems","text":"\n The most successful product managers think of themselves as finders of pain, not finders of products.\nIn my experience launching ProductPlan and prior products, I’ve learned that talking early with potential customers to identify pain can lead you to create better, more innovative solutions. Although it may seem obvious, that’s not how many companies start—they often start by building a product and then later seek out problems for it to solve.\nIt’s this “product-first” thinking that is at the core of many product failures.\nWhen the up-front pain-finding doesn’t happen, products miss the mark and can waste countless hours in development effort. Unfortunately, I’ve witnessed this first-hand.\nMy philosophy: Find the patterns of pain first, and you’ll be able to create better products. \nUltimately, what you’re seeking is a market with a consistent problem area. Then, you can obsess about that problem. Thoroughly validate it and confirm it’s a problem you can solve. Moreover, if you find that solving this pain is at the top of your customer’s priority list, you have a much better shot at creating a winning product.\nDownload the Product-Market Fit Book ➜\nFinding Pain through Customer Discovery\nPeople buy products to reduce pain or create a gain. You can uncover this through customer discovery. Through customer discovery, you can learn what it would mean to a customer if you solved that problem.\nYour goal is to uncover the value proposition of solving problems. A value proposition represents the value that the customer gets out of using your product. So a value proposition could mean:\nSaving money.\nSaving time.\nMaking money.\nLifestyle benefits or professional benefits such as looking good in front of your boss.\nI believe a “product” is more than the product itself; it includes the pricing, services, the way it’s sold, and so much more. With this broad definition, you have much more room to discover frustrations that customers are facing with their current solutions or the way they’re solving problems today.\nMy recommendation: start by speaking with at least ten prospective customers. Even at low numbers, these interviews will give you incredible insight, especially if you start hearing a consistent pattern of pain.\nAsk the Right Questions\nOne of the techniques that I recommend is asking open-ended questions. Open-ended questions allow people to include more information in their answers, including how they feel, which will lead you to ask questions you hadn’t considered.\n“Why?” is by far the most powerful question you can ask, so ask it often. Rarely accept a customer’s initial response. By asking “why?” as a follow-up question, you can extract an enlightening answer and get to the crux of an issue.\nOnce you find a problem to solve, it’s essential to understand how high on the priority list this falls for your prospects. An even more basic issue to understand is whether the customer is aware that they have a problem. If you need to educate customers that they have a problem in the first place, that’s a sign it could be tough to create awareness and acquire customers in the future. And if they are aware they have a problem, is the problem big enough, pervasive enough, and painful enough that someone would be willing to pay you to solve it? Do they even have the budget and the decision-making authority to purchase?\nIf you’re solving problems that people don’t care about solving, or worse, they’re not willing to pay, then you don’t have a business model that’s going to work for your product.\nPattern Recognition\nA lot of people think the validation of a new product is a scientific process. For instance, if you conduct 30 or 40 interviews, then somehow, you will achieve a statistically valid result that gives you the truth. But this process is subjective, and biases abound.\nYou have to read into the nuance of what people say, and that is anything but scientific.\nWhen you conduct about 15-20 interviews, you will start to hear the same things again and again. You’ll hear patterns. So by the 21st interview, you’ll ideally hear something similar to what you’ve heard previously.\nHowever, if you do not hear a pattern of pain after a dozen interviews, then there might not be a problem to solve.\nThere is no magic number for the right amount of interviews. However, for every additional interview you conduct, you’re incrementally lowering your risk of failure. You can conduct ten interviews and reduce your risk of failure somewhat, or 20 interviews and reduce it even further. After 90 interviews, assuming you’re asking the right questions, you can reduce your risk substantially. That is the main point of the process.\nAlso, as I interview, I pivot my questions and the pitch along the way. So my fourth interview is nothing like my first. Once I learn where I missed the mark, I adjust and move on. This flexibility is especially true if you’re validating a solution for a domain where you have limited experience. It can be a little awkward if you’re not speaking the same language for the field. If that’s the case, you’ll learn how to phrase questions, use the right industry buzzwords, etc.\nHow We Found Patterns of Pain at ProductPlan\nAt ProductPlan, we discovered pain around the product roadmap process by initially conducting 30 interviews with product managers from a variety of companies. Most of these discussions focused on their day-to-day challenges, and the pain they were experiencing planning, prioritizing, and communicating their product roadmap.\nWe discovered significant pain around product roadmaps. Product managers were spending hours every week on the roadmapping process, and they still weren’t able to prioritize effectively. There were disconnects communicating the roadmap with internal stakeholders.\nThey found it hard to get alignment within their organizations and found it challenging to tie the roadmap back to strategy. We also discovered that, because they wanted their roadmap presentation to look good, they spent valuable time making their roadmap look great for stakeholders and executives. The visual aspect mattered.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nBased on discovering this pain, we built and launched a product that hit the pain head-on. We didn’t try to solve every problem they had but focused on reducing the pain around product roadmaps. We also created a gain by helping product managers communicate with and align their teams better. Ultimately, we help them ship better products, and we help them look good with beautiful roadmaps.\nWe spent hours coordinating and conducting those initial interviews. By the time we launched the product, we had done over 70 interviews. But because of all of this up-front work, we got our roadmap software to market quickly, on a tight budget, and we made no significant pivots along the way.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nYou can read more about finding patterns of pain and product-market fit in our book: Find Product-Market Fit Faster, Lessons for Product Managers\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/patterns-of-pain/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925752148,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Product Management Tools: What Should Your Product Stack Include?","text":"\n \n When talking about tools for product managers, we’re usually referring to the standard few that most product managers use every day. These product management tools generally include product analytics software, development tracking tools, and roadmapping software.\nBut a product manager’s job involves a lot more than gather product insight, tracking the backlog, and reviewing the product roadmap. Whether you’re a new product manager or a seasoned PM just wanting to make sure you’re not missing a key component of your role because you’re lacking the proper tool—the following is a list of product management tools to help you excel in your role.\n12 Product Management Tools to Have in Your Product Stack\n1. User tracking and analysis tools (such as Pendo and Amplitude)\nThese tools can be invaluable sources of intelligence and insight into how your software’s users or your website’s visitors are actually engaging with your product and your content.\nWhereas customer surveys or interviews — which are valuable tools in their own right — will tell you only what your customers say and think product analytics platforms capture and help you analyze what those customers actually do.\nIf your company sells software or just maintains a lot of content on a website, deploying a service like Pendo or Amplitude can uncover important realities about what resonates with your users, and what doesn’t.\n2. Roadmapping software (such as ProductPlan)\nRoadmapping software is a must-have item on any list of product management tools. Using any non-native roadmap application to draft and maintain your product roadmap (such as spreadsheets or slide decks) will create far more work, be far less flexible and easy to share, and more prone to version-control issues that can slow your product’s progress. This is exactly why we built ProductPlan.\nProductPlan makes it easy for product teams to build and collaborate on product roadmaps. A visual, interactive roadmap is much more effective for communicating product strategy and helps align your team around your product vision.\nWatch the webinar, What’s in Your Product Stack: Roadmap Tools\n3. Customer survey tools (such as SurveyMonkey or Typeform)\nWhat’s great about web-based survey tools like SurveyMonkey or Typeform is that they have so many types of pre-formatted questions that, whether you want to offer multiple-choice questions, drop-down lists, or just open comment fields, you can put together a survey in minutes.\nYou can then send the survey out to your customers and easily track and analyze the results.\nFor gathering quick answers to important user questions, these tools are extremely helpful. But beware: Like email, online survey tools are so easy, convenient, and inexpensive that it can be tempting to overuse them. Use your surveys sparingly, so as not to upset your user base.\n4. Recording apps for customer interviews (such as GoToMeeting or Zoom)\nWhen you speak on the phone with customers, even if you’re just calling to answer a question, it’s always a great idea to record the call. Using a tool such as GoToMeeting or Zoom makes it easy to record those conversations and reference them later. You never know when a customer will offer valuable insight, ask a question you realize a lot of other users will have, or just share with you a novel why they’re using your product that you might not have otherwise thought of.\n5. Industry analyst accounts (like Gartner or Sirius Decisions)\nHere’s a tool you probably wouldn’t immediately think of as part of the product management tool stack — but depending on your industry and target customer, you might want to consider it.\nHaving access to the collective industry research and the latest thinking of the analysts covering your space can be extremely beneficial in terms of guiding your strategic thinking and helping you determine where your market is headed. The statistics and reports these research firms (such as Gartner or Sirius Decisions) output can give you just the types of data you need to prioritize and earn stakeholder buy-in for specific themes and features on your product roadmap.\nOf course, this will be among the most expensive product management tool on this list, so you might need to use your powers of persuasion (which you no doubt have as a product manager) to convince your management team of its value.\nDownload the Toolkit for Product Managers➜\n6. Team messaging tools (such as Slack or Confluence)\nWhen your product development, or any complex and cross-functional initiative, gets underway, you will want an easy and immediate means of communicating — as well as maintaining an ongoing record of all communications related to the initiative.\nThankfully, there are many simple, cloud-based tools that allow for just this type of easy and centralized team communication. Slack and Atlassian’s Confluence are a few that come to mind.\n7. Presentation software (like PowerPoint or Keynote)\nWe often point out how inefficient presentation tools are for roadmaps. But that doesn’t mean that PowerPoint or Keynote shouldn’t have a prominent slot in your product management toolkit.\nPresentation decks can be invaluable for communicating your high-level strategies, visions, and plans across your organization and to external audiences like customers.\nVision decks, for example, can be a powerful way of communicating your product’s vision to a group of executive stakeholders and earning their buy-in. Presentations can also be a highly effective way of conducting sales training or educating industry analysts about your product.\nRoadmap Software is a Must-Have (Not a Nice to Have) ➜\n8. Project management tools (such as Jira, Pivotal Tracker, or Trello)\nLike the team messaging tools we listed above, today’s project management applications are much more robust and provide a simplified means of tracking and documenting details.\nUsing a web app such as Trello, for example, you can track and share various items with relevant team members by grouping these items into easy-to-view Boards — such as “Sales Collateral in Progress” — and then creating individual Cards below, such as “Product Data Sheets” or “Case Studies.” These cards can easily be dragged and dropped under different Boards — say, from “In Progress” to “Under Review.”\nOther popular project management tools include Microsoft Project, which teams typically arrange in Gantt chart format, and Jira, which is often configured as a less visual issue-tracking tool. And tools like Pivotal Tracker will help you to execute on your roadmap and keep your backlog organized.\nDownload the free Backlog Refinement: How to Prioritize What Matters Book➜\n9. Feature flagging software (such as Split.io or LaunchDarkly)\nFeature flags give product teams an easy way to “turn on and off” specific features once code has been deployed to production. This comes in handy in a number of scenarios: coordinating a big feature launch, A/B testing, rolling back a new problematic feature.\nTools such as Split.io and LaunchDarkly empower product teams to manage feature flags and get the most out of their usage.\n10. Session replay and heatmap tools (such as FullStory or Hotjar)\nAs a product manager, you spend a lot of time trying to dig into the minds of your customers and unearth exactly what the experience of using your product is like for them. With tools like FullStory and Hotjar, you can get insight into user behavior like never before.\nHeatmap software helps you understand exactly what users on your site care about by visually representing their on-site behavior. This insight can be extremely valuable as supplemental data for your product team. A heatmap in conjunction with a number of session replays and a few customer interviews will give you plenty of data to make an informed product decision.\n11. Flowcharting tools (such as Visio)\nAlthough not all product managers use flowchart and diagram applications, the affordability and ease of use of these tools make them a great way of performing a step that many PMs overlook but shouldn’t — customer journey mapping.\nCreating a customer journey map is helpful in giving you and your organization a clearer view of your customer’s full experience with your company. When created properly, a journey map will show all of the touchpoints an individual has with your organization from the first visit to your website (or the first call from one of your sales reps) through purchasing and using your product.\nJourney maps can also focus specifically on the full experience of using your product — say, from the first visit to the site, through completing an online form, through any contacts the user has with your sales reps or other staff, through downloading and logging in to your tool.\nFlowcharting and diagramming tools — like Microsoft Visio and OmniGraffle — can be helpful in mapping out any specific aspects of a user’s workflow or experience with your product. And because they offer a visual view of that workflow or experience — as opposed to merely a list of steps your customer will take — the flowcharts you output from these tools can then help you uncover insights into how to strategically prioritize your product roadmap.\n12. Idea-capture and collaboration tools (like Evernote and Google Drive)\nFinally, don’t forget the business productivity tools to capture ideas, review and share notes from meetings, and organize your insights into cohesive plans to earn stakeholder support.\nHere we’re thinking about idea-capturing tools like Evernote, cloud-based collaboration apps like Google Drive, Dropbox — and even paper and pen because sometimes inspiration strikes when your smartphone is across the room!\nGet a Budget for Your Product Management Tools\nRequesting budgets for a tool is still a relatively rare occurrence for product teams, who traditionally haven’t had any dedicated budget and rarely ask for anything financial other than approving travel expenses or a new laptop. So, how do you successfully broach this subject with the executives holding the purse strings?\nDownload Get Buy-In on Your Product Stack➜\n1. Make assumptions\nPaint a picture of how life will be better once you have this tool because you’re either more productive, more nimble, your customers are happier, you’re saving the company money or you’re improving time to market, you can begin trying to quantify those benefits.\nFor example, having a requirements management tool will save the team 15 hours per week and reduce the likelihood that customer requests will fall through the cracks, which will reduce the average turnaround time from customer feedback to deployed feature by one sprint.\n2. Strength in numbers\nWhile a tool that only helps product management is still valuable, a much stronger case can be made when the tool will benefit other groups in the organization. This could be via direct usage—meaning that not only will product management use this tool but it will also be utilized by customer support or engineering—or as an indirect benefit where the output of the tool will be consumed by another group and make them more efficient as well. In addition to benefitting more than just the product management team, it also gives you another executive in your corner when it’s time to ask for money.\n3. Acknowledge the alternatives\nIn most cases, there are multiple vendors offering specialized software solutions that address your needs. Even if you have already settled on a particular vendor, do your homework and include the other options as part of your pitch.\nYou can highlight why the solution you’re sweet on is superior, whether it’s the features or the cost, and potentially have a fallback plan if there’s a cheaper, inferior choice you could live with if you can’t get the full budget you were looking for.\n4. Try the free-trial\nIf the tool you want has a free trial, dive in and start using the product before you even broach the budget subject with the powers that be. Not only will you be able to confirm that it’s the tool you want, but you can also collect more data to strengthen the business case when the trial is ready to expire, and you can demonstrate exactly how your team is using it.\n5. Overcome the uncomfortable ask\nProduct teams aren’t used to requesting a budget for tools, but that doesn’t mean the team doesn’t deserve them. High performing organizations need tools and processes that support their growth and expanding portfolio, so there’s no shame in requesting the budget required to equip your team with tools that can truly make a difference. Even if the funds aren’t available immediately, you can at least start the conversation to carve out a dedicated product management tool budget for the next planning round to get them in the future.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nDid we forget anything useful?

The static nature of traditional product planning cycles fails to consider quickly-improving technologies and unforeseen changes in the market. This approach can be a significant pitfall in today’s fast-paced environment, making your organization vulnerable to missed opportunities and increased risks.\nIterative planning enables product management teams to respond quickly to changes in the market and emerging trends. The ability to adapt and adjust to changing product strategies positions companies for continuous improvement and sustained success. Ongoing planning is crucial for staying ahead in a competitive landscape.\nThe Case for Embracing Agility\nCompanies that have successfully embraced continuous planning showcase the benefits of staying nimble. From pivoting strategies based on user feedback to quickly adapting to market shifts, many organizations have embraced the competitive advantage that year-round planning brings.\nFor one, product teams can go to market faster and more cost-effectively. Product managers can streamline decision-making, identify efficiencies, and reduce time-to-market by consistently reassessing and refining their strategies.\nYear-round planning can also help product teams improve their chances of success. Continuous planning helps product teams understand market dynamics and customer feedback while remaining competitive and making informed decisions. Implementing this proactive approach maximizes the chances of a successful product.\nFinally, an iterative planning process can help enhance your credibility and product leadership. Year-round planning demonstrates adaptability, strategic foresight, and a commitment to meeting customer needs. You can improve your company’s reputation by delivering quality products and showcasing yourself as a leader in innovation.\nSetting your annual planning processes to support year-round planning\nBefore diving into best practices for year-round planning, product leaders should start by evaluating their current annual planning objectives. Yearly planning should not be discarded when shifting to an iterative approach. Instead, it should be reviewed and adjusted to support the flexibility and strategy of the team’s goals.\nFirstly, you want to review your product vision. When setting strategic corporate goals, your team should have actionable and aspirational goals aligned with the company’s overall strategy. Your organization can then leverage these strategic objectives to drive yearly prioritization decisions. Frequent reviews will set your team up for strategic reflection on progress and future change.\nThen, set the expectation that change is inevitable and some unknowns will be discovered later. Assuming that things will go according to plan leaves little room for innovation and adapting to new trends. Establishing a culture of continuous improvement and learning from unexpected changes is crucial.\nLastly, invite your key stakeholders to provide feedback throughout the process. You want to create room for multiple perspectives and diversify ways to achieve desired outcomes. Based on the findings of our 2024 State of Product Management Report, 76% of product teams are using live meetings to communicate product strategy. Still, opportunities exist to encourage your stakeholders to observe changes and provide feedback asynchronously, like utilizing a product management platform. This can open up doors for product teams to make decisions faster and to feel empowered knowing their stakeholders are aligned with their product strategy.\nAt the end of an annual planning process, the team should have a clear vision for the year: collective goals and how new ideas in the future will tie back to the outcomes that the company has set to achieve as a whole. Annual planning doesn’t have to be the perfect solution to your year, but you can set your team up for success by building in space to pivot.\nWhat should year-round planning look like?\nWhen implementing year-round planning practices, taking time on a regular cadence outside of annual planning is vital to evaluate outcomes and feedback and adapt where necessary.\nWhen your team checks in on your goals more frequently, it is recommended to set quarterly planning objectives aligning with the company’s overall goals during annual planning. These quarterly planning objectives can be broken down into four steps:\nIn addition to following these key steps, there are several best practices that you should follow throughout the year to ensure you are being efficient in your product-planning processes.\nBest Practices of Year-Round Product Planning\nMaintain an open line of communication with your customers and end users throughout the entire product lifecycle. Ongoing dialogue fosters a deeper understanding of customers’ evolving needs and provides insights that guide the creation of the most effective product strategy. Talking with end users ensures that your product aligns with user expectations, resulting in a more resonant and successful end product.\nStay informed on market trends. This step is essential for product management leaders. Regular market assessments give product teams insights into changing customer needs and preferences. Keep a pulse on what your competitors are taking on as their latest strategies, too.\nRely on data to support your decision-making. Data and analytics can help your team get a clear understanding of feature performance and customer needs. Challenge your team’s ways of working by asking questions like, “Are we measuring the right things?” and “Are there other metrics we should be measuring?”\nCollaborate and communicate with your key stakeholders. The alignment between product, executives, engineering, operations/support, sales, and marketing functions is crucial for product success. Having a representative from the various departments will allow you to create a product strategy that supports other teams at the company while bringing in the best ideas. Regularly check in with your stakeholders and be transparent throughout the planning process.\nConclusion\nThe term “annual planning” alone can put a lot of pressure on product teams. But learning more about untraditional ways to set team- and organization-wide goals can alleviate some of that pressure and help product leaders embrace change and innovation. Understanding that there will need to be necessary adjustments outside the standard once-a-year planning process empowers teams to bake in flexibility and work with changing times rather than staying stagnant in a changing market.\nCurious to learn more?

The internal pressure to deliver faster and more frequently often leaves product teams feeling like they have to slim down the scope of a feature, change the architecture, or make design decisions, all in the name of expediency.\nThankfully, the product development lifecycle doesn’t always have to exist in a pressure cooker. Therefore, executing an ambitious product roadmap with proper planning is not only possible but also an exciting experience.\nA successful product never sacrifices the user experience.\nAnd the one area that you should never skimp on in your development recipe is user experience (UX). Creating a positive user experience is essential for innovative companies to retain customers, grow their user base, and differentiate from their competitors.\nAt ProductPlan, UX is always top of mind when defining a new feature, and we continue to prioritize it as we refine existing features and functionality over time. It’s something we pride ourselves on, and I am thrilled to be part of an organization that believes in the power of the user experience.\nProductPlan’s journey to enhance the user experience of Launch Management.\nLast December, our product and development teams were juggling development cadence and vacation schedules. So, we took a step back and considered prioritizing UX refinements that we could achieve with limited resources. We started by brainstorming the enhancements that we could ship, Kanban style.\nThe development team, product designer, and I looked closely at ProductPlan’s Launch Management solution. The Launch Management solution is a relatively new feature—we first released it last fall. It is a new tool for product teams that helps them manage a cross-functional go-to-market process. Inconsistent ad hoc launch processes are transformed into visible, flexible, and easily repeatable plans that live alongside the product roadmap.\nDespite the newness of Launch Management, we knew it was the perfect place for us to focus on UX enhancements. Our goal with updating the Launch Dashboard was to help customers see the information most relevant to them at the top via launches in descending order by date. We also tackled keyboard navigation improvements to our Add a Task flow in Launch Checklists and did an overall sweep of our UI, including minor tweaks to colors, hover states, alignment, copy, and more.\nLearn how to transform your product launches from chaos to success➜\nSome of these enhancements may not sound too flashy on their own. Still, when viewed as part of the overall user experience, they impact how customers feel when using our product, impacting retention, engagement, and growth.\nI share this brief behind-the-scenes snapshot of our development process to showcase how essential the user experience is for every stage of the product development cycle.\nStill not convinced UX should be a priority? Keep reading to learn three reasons that will change your mind.\n1. User retention: When customers are happy, they stick around.\nHave you ever walked into a room and couldn’t figure out where the light switch is? Maybe you finally figured it out but continue getting frustrated every time you enter that room.\nThat’s a poor UX experience, and this stuff happens in software constantly. It’s what leads to user frustration and can ultimately impact churn. A product with a simple, intuitive, and easy-to-use interface is more likely to elicit joy in users.\nYou may not move houses because of a light switch, but you’d likely think about switching products if it was frustrating to use daily. By providing a seamless user experience, businesses can reduce user frustration and increase joy, leading to higher levels of customer retention.\n2. Increase engagement: When it’s easy to use, your customers will use it more.\nUX also plays a significant role in enhancing engagement. Every product team uses some metrics to track engagement, whether active use, stickiness, feature usage, or something else. By launch, we’ve usually put a lot of research, validation, and effort into a new capability, so we expect it to do well, right?\nSometimes it doesn’t, and there are many reasons why that could be, such as we just got the customer’s actual problem wrong. But sometimes, it could just need some UX love to reduce complexity. A product or feature that is easy to use and provides a straightforward solution for a customer’s needs will encourage users to spend more time using it.\n3. Enable product-led growth: An approachable, easy-to-use user experience will attract more customers.\nIt’s almost impossible to be in the product world without hearing about product-led growth. The bottom line is that consumers expect to test a product. They want to buy it themselves and roll it out with little to no friction.\nReducing that friction across the product interface is something UX can help with, whether that’s an easy onboarding flow, upgrade paths, or just an overall simple-to-use experience.\nUltimately, UX design is a critical aspect of your product. A well-designed UX can help you minimize churn and increase engagement and product-led growth opportunities. It can help reduce frustration, increase user joy, and eliminate friction.\nTry Launch Management today!\nLaunch Management is available as a part of our Enterprise plan and our two-week free trial.

Therefore, we think it’s time to turn the spotlight on who matters: our customers. Thanks to the review site G2, our users share their honest thoughts about our product management platform.\nWe love hearing directly from our customers. And what they have to say is helpful to anyone looking to learn more about how an end-to-end product management platform works. We’re excited to highlight some of the feedback they had to share below.\nIf you want to provide feedback or check out the full reviews, visit our G2 page today!\nFostering better collaboration\nIt’s all too common to feel siloed, especially when working at an enterprise company or in a highly cross-functional role. Getting feedback and keeping people updated with outdated tools and increasingly remote teams is tough. Luckily, our customers have overcome these pesky silos thanks to the ProductPlan platform.\nA verified user in the computer software space notes, “Before ProductPlan, we would have to update multiple sources constantly. It was hard to maintain and keep up to date while including only relevant information for specific groups. Now we can leverage tags in ProductPlan to create specific views that are always up to date. Overall it has already led to time savings and is improving how we communicate internally.”\nCommenting on ProductPlan’s roadmap features, Tiffany W., a Product and Business Analysis Director, writes, “While we still maintain a couple of different styles of roadmaps (for different audiences), they are all in one place and they are all linked – making it easy to keep all of them up to date. Additionally, we have incorporated additional users to assist with collaboration on the relevant roadmaps, thus enhancing visibility and awareness and introducing better collaboration!”\nCollaboration at every level is absolutely essential for success. Our customers have benefitted from how our platform serves as a single source of truth for all stakeholders.\nEffective communication of the product strategy\nEstablishing and maintaining a focused product strategy is difficult. Internal and external stakeholders naturally have conflicting priorities. So how do you alleviate concerns and keep people engaged and bought into the strategy? Our users found the answers to these questions with ProductPlan’s help.\nA verified user at an enterprise-level Consumer Goods company comments, “ProductPlan enables our team to share all of the activities that are going on in different areas so we can gain one clear view with the overall aim of using it to determine our medium to long term strategy. It is now forming a central part of our yearly planning process as it contains up-to-date information and can be manipulated as required to suit many different needs.”\nPhillip P., a Software Engineer from a mid-market company, gets even more specific: “I use more than 20 roadmap templates a day easily. With ProductPlan it is relatively easy to plan, visualize and communicate a product strategy in a matter of minutes using the integrations with Jira, Slack, Trello to streamline each process.”\nOn getting buy-in, Dylan, a Product Marketing Manager at a small business, said: “I utilize ProductPlan to propose, visualize, show options, and track [the] progress of a full portfolio of products. This portfolio is made up of a number of products with overlapping requirements and dependencies. Being able to provide clear communication about this complex work is critical to getting buy-in and agreement amongst a large group of internal and external stakeholders.”\nWe live in an era where many companies are doing more with less. The successful ones have the product strategy at the center of everything they do. Subsequently, they continue to deliver innovative products their customers love. And ProductPlan is there to support them by organizing all the vital information in one place!\nKeeping the focus on the outcome rather than the output\nIt can be tempting to fall into the trap of focusing on outputs during a product development lifecycle. Roadmaps and product strategies risk becoming a never-ending backlog if the emphasis on outcomes is absent. As a result, a product management team transforms into just another feature factory. With ProductPlan, product organizations don’t have to worry about this common planning pitfall.\nA verified user at a mid-market insurance company stated that ProductPlan helps him “[Keep the focus on] outcomes: [by having the] ability to see all company product epics, initiatives, and features in one place, and categorize by customer journey/teams. [ProductPlan] saves time in creating packs with the information and allows stakeholders to self-serve the latest updates.”\nLouisa, the Head of Global Marketing at an enterprise company, comments on how staying objective-focused with ProductPlan helped her team’s ROI: “We obtained better results in increasing our ROI, thanks to the fact that we had the support of ProductPlan to be our daily guide and to manage all our business plans and objectives.”\nProductivity cannot be solely measured by items checked on a to-do list. With ProductPlan, our customers can ensure the work they are doing aligns with the larger business goals. As a result, everything they launch delivers outcomes that support success and growth.\nWe’re just getting started\nThe feedback our customers share with us is invaluable to the work we’re doing on our end-to-end product management solution. We look forward to hearing more from our customers in the future! We cannot thank our customers enough for their continued support.\nNot a ProductPlan customer yet?

Along with the honor of getting certified as a Great Place to Work (May 2021—May 2022), we earned the recognition of Fortune’s 2021 Best (Small or Medium) Workplaces.\nAlthough one of our team’s values is humility, I wanted to take a moment to say, “heck yeah!” Thank you to the entirety of the team for your efforts navigating this past year.\nWhat Did This Year Look like for ProductPlan?\nLike many companies, we practically learned overnight how to manage our business differently with the onset of the pandemic. The process of placing our operating practices and guiding principles under a microscope allowed us to solidify what was working well and what we needed to improve.\nIn particular, we saw the need to be more intentional about how we build a great culture. ProductPlan believes how employees act when nobody is looking defines company culture. We felt alignment become even more critical in a world where our team is all working remotely. We also know people want to work alongside people they trust.\nStrong values alignment becomes even more critical as a company scales and growth accelerates. In the past year alone, our business doubled in size. We released several key product enhancements. Product organizations utilized these enhancements to help simplify the shipment of products.\nWhat’s Our Secret Sauce?\nSo how did we win Fortune’s 2021 Best (Small or Medium) Workplaces over the ten thousand contending companies? We believe a key was really clarifying and subsequently living by those values that bind us.\nProductPlan’s core values assist in recognition as one of Fortune’s great places to work.\nHustle: We’re passionate about what we’re doing. But we hustle to preserve time with our friends and family. We empower employees to own the outcome. We encourage them to want to win because it means we are making an impact as a whole.\nHumility: We listen first and ask questions when we don’t have the answers. We approach interactions and problems with curiosity and adjust our course when needed.\nHeart: We want our work to have meaning, and we care deeply for our team, our customers, and our society at large. We embrace the visible and invisible differences to create a place where people feel safe speaking plainly and being the best version of themselves.\n“I’m really proud of how the team exemplifies Hustle, Humility, and Heart every day. We help our colleagues’ career paths grow and develop. I’ve loved getting to see team members get the chance to move into different teams and get promoted into new roles from a manager of customer success, becoming a product manager to a customer success manager, becoming a sales engineer. Seeing folks get the chance to spread their wings, try something new, and move forward is core to what I think Hustle, Humility, and Heart mean in our workplace.” – Diana Ciontea – Finance\n“We work with real people. We’re not just numbers and jobs to be done. The team gets to know each other and spends time caring about each other’s interests, and there’s trust built there. I trust that my colleagues are putting in their heart, with humility and they’re hustling in everything they do that helps us remember that we’re all people behind the job.” – Nick Fields – Product management\n[VIDEO on Heart Humility and Hustle]\nFostering Connection at ProductPlan\nAfter the Black Lives Matter protests, we came together as a company to openly share how people were feeling. It was particularly moving to hear people speak plainly about what this topic meant to them while also serving as a time to catalog our practices. These conversations inspired the creation of our diversity and inclusion task force. This cross-functional collaboration has spawned various initiatives, including mental health days, a fundraiser for disadvantaged children, and a  fresh look at the hiring process.\nProductPlan’s biannual “Fest.”\nAnother critical moment for our team was launching our first, all remote, teamwide gathering we call Fest. In the past, Fest represented a biannual event where in-office and remote coworkers would convene for social and educational activities. Activities included presentations from customers to lightning talks where employees volunteer to present on a topic of passion and trivia at a local brewery, to name a few. This event represented a great way to cultivate strong team alignment, especially since most of our team lives outside Santa Barbara. As we all know, large in-person gatherings weren’t on the agenda this past year, so we had to improvise.\nThe process of building a weeklong schedule to support a 100% remote Fest helped flesh out many of the lingering habits ingrained from in-office work that didn’t support remote workers. While we all look forward to a face-to-face Fest again, we believe the emphasis on learning how to do remote work well sets us up for longer-term success.\nInspired by feedback from our team, we have since launched a mentorship program and a Culture, Collaboration, and Connection (CCC) monthly meetup. At CCC, in a small group setting, we tackle various topics ranging from the company’s long-term strategy to learning more about each other’s interests outside of work.\nTrust and Strategy at ProductPlan\nSome of us may have worked in lower trust or what some may call ‘political’ environments. People often expend unnecessary energy in the wrong areas. Also, those environments tend to stifle open communication among teams. We believe that the best ideas can come from anywhere. Consequently, it is incumbent upon our organization to ensure processes amplify and encourage the sharing of information.\nA great example is how information our team gathers from customers finds its way into our product prioritization process. The bulk of our team is talking with our customers every day. Harnessing insights from these conversations is foundational to our strategy especially given how quickly the product management space evolves.\nTrust, or a lack thereof, is something we know product managers often grapple with internally. Often, they feel frustrated conveying to stakeholders how and why things need prioritization. Ultimately, we see our role at ProductPlan as helping our customers instill greater trust within their own organization.\n“It feels like my input is valued here. We work hard, but we love the work we’re doing because we know it’s positively impacting on ourselves, our customers, and the world.” – Sierra Newell – Marketing\n“I know when I come in, I can be my authentic self. I’m welcomed and valued for that. I can walk in the door and don’t have to be a different person. I can be who I am, and everyone respects and values me at ProductPlan. I can flourish and be happy and fulfilled because I can be myself at the end of the day. – Damon Navo – Customer Success\nFinal Thoughts on Fortune’s Great Places to Work\nBeing recognized as one of Fortune’s great places to work is a tremendous honor, especially in light of the challenges brought about over the past year. We also believe much of our success is still in front of us. We’re excited to continue our journey to help product organizations simplify the product life cycle and build organizational trust.\nCheck out our Careers Page if you are interested in a role at ProductPlan.\nCheck Out Our Career Page ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/top-places-to-work/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925715540,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"ProductPlan's Approach to Product Design","text":"\n At ProductPlan, we treat product design with intention. From inception to delivery, we follow a rigorous process that ensures our customers get the best possible user experience. Transparency is a key cornerstone of that process. By hosting design sessions with engineers, PMs, and product designers, we gain different perspectives on a single problem. This helps shape our solution and brings the entire organization into alignment before the designs are seen by customers.\nInterested in learning more? We thought so. We’ll share our entire process below from start to finish. Let’s get to designing better products!\nTriple Diamond Approach\nThe overarching methodology we follow at ProductPlan is the Triple Diamond Approach created by Zendesk. For those unfamiliar, it’s a way to attack any design problem using four distinct segments: Discovery, Development, Validation, and Rollout.\nBefore we break the approach down, why do we use it? Primarily for its ease of use. With Triple Diamond, we start simple and expand from there. There’s no need to gather a ton of feedback upfront. Instead, we collect feedback from users over time and learn how they use the product live. It also provides a stop-gap to prevent any designer, engineer, PM, or stakeholder from trying to solve every problem.\nOver-designing a feature, especially an MVP, can lead to unnecessary overhead and customer support once the feature is released. Sure, delighters are nice to have and add depth to the product, but they must be planned meaningfully. Now, let’s dive a little deeper into the activities in each ” segment” in the triple diamond.\nDiscovery\nThe Discovery segment has four main activities: Problem Discovery, Problem Validation, Solution Discovery, and Concept Validation. First, product designers should seek an understanding of the problem space and the customer’s needs. Second, they formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem that needs to be solved from the user’s POV. Then they begin researching potential solutions to solve the problem. Finally, designers can start creating early mockups and prototypes to be put in front of customers.\nDevelopment\nWith a potential solution to the problem, the development of prototypes can be tested both internally and externally. Cross-discipline teams work closely with one another during this phase and work through found UI and UX.\nValidation\nValidation is the Early Access Program with customers to gain more insights. Typically, a select beta user group is invited to test the new feature/product. This beta group allows for more feedback from real customers as they incorporate the new feature or functionality into their normal flow.\nRollout\nOnce enough data has been acquired and provides the necessary confidence in delivering a feature or functionality, general availability (GA) is ready for all customers.\nProduct Design Breakdown\nWith the Triple Diamond Approach out of the way, let’s break down exactly how we approach product design at ProductPlan. We’ll go through our entire product design process and focus on what works for us. Let’s start at the beginning with the Inception phase.\nInception\nWorking alongside our product managers and reviewing customers’ feedback typically reveals a new user experience pain point that possibly needs to be addressed. Before we begin our exploration, we constantly tie any problem hypotheses to our company objective(s) that directly refer to the product objectives.\nThe customer’s needs are super important at this stage. Hosting user interviews with current or potential customers gives us a foundation to start designing and working through hypotheses. From there, we categorize the needs to create a proper solution, which leads us to the next step, Research.\nResearch\nNext comes one of the most important steps in our process: Research. Here, we employ three pillars of product design research: competitive analysis, user testing, and user interviews.\nCompetitive analysis is our very simple starting point within our research methodology. What our competitors or someone similar in our industry are doing provides us with many insights into our design principles. Here we ask the following questions:\nWhat seems to be working?\nWhat can we glean from that work to help kick-start our Exploration phase?\nWhat are some things we can avoid?\nAre certain tools too complicated?\nCan they be reduced to a more basic form so that we can build upon and grow the feature or tool?\nThe next steps involve user interviews followed up by user testing. For user interviews, we rely on our amazing Customer Success Managers and Product Managers to set up customer calls with users that we feel may benefit from a feature we are working on. After compiling feedback and input from these interviews, we can pose very early exploratory plans, protocols, and further questions to our users through user testing. From there, we take the valuable feedback from our customers and begin to iterate in the Exploration phase.\nExploration\nOnce we have a rough idea of the customers’ needs, we can begin exploring potential solutions. This is where our initial drawings are created. Something we like to emphasize during this phase is to make these early drawings outside of a design tool such as Figma. Instead, pen and paper or a drawing app are employed. We do this instead of working directly in Figma as we feel it does not limit ourselves creatively. Working within a design tool immediately may hinder the exploration process as you feel you must adhere to certain designs or guidelines. The most important thing during this phase is to get any raw idea out there, even if it’s far-fetched.\nDuring this design phase, we also hold blue sky sessions with our PM, QA, and engineering teams. At the end of the day, as a design team, we need to both diverge and converge. All designers participate in blue sky sessions to provide more insights and context since there may be something another team/designer is working on similar to our efforts. These sessions help us ensure we are all in alignment between product, product design, and engineering.\nDesign system\nHere’s where the actual heads-down design work begins. The designs might change from feature to feature, but we keep a few tenets in mind during this phase: accessibility, reusability, and brand consistency. This is achieved with confidence through our design system: Atlas.\nIn Atlas, accessibility is near and dear to our hearts. The web should be built for all, and while we are still working towards making our site more and more accessible, there are a couple of rules we have in place for anything we build. First, colors always meet 4.5:1 to achieve AA standards. Second, any new UI component built or expanded upon has native keyboard navigation functionality. In this way, we make sure that as our product grows and changes, we are still designing in a way that keeps access to our tool in the hands of everyone.\nWe strongly emphasize reusable components, which refer to building blocks used in design and code. These components include buttons, various selection inputs, page layouts, and other user interface elements. We do this for two reasons. Not having to redesign a certain component saves time and gives our designers more confidence in what they are building. And two, not having to restyle or rebuild functionality gives our engineers the freedom to focus on tests and enhancements.\nFinally, since we don’t want our customers to have a disjointed experience, we maintain consistency across our global styles and brand. This makes for a better-unified experience from end to end. It also prevents confusion from an incongruous design to the rest of the platform.\nDesign review\nAfter a design is complete, it’s time for review within our team and cross-functionally with engineering. This is accomplished through two syncs: one with just the design team and the other with design plus key engineering stakeholders.\nOur weekly design team sync is a free space to share what we’ve been working on and explain user needs and design decisions. The feedback from other design members is vital as it keeps us all in lockstep. It’s also important to emphasize providing psychological safety during this sync. This creates an environment where we can share openly without judgment.\nOur engineering syncs allow us to meet with key engineering individuals to help align the design direction. From here, engineering can share with the larger team to keep everyone aligned. We can also gather feedback from the engineering team here if dev work is found. From here, we fine-tune designs accordingly.\nFrom these conversations, PMs and Design can better understand the project’s scope from an engineering perspective and the time allotted to the problem and solution. Full designs from here can be broken down into snack-able items that allow us to release an MVP while having a list of enhancements to chip away at in parallel with other work.\nDelivery\nDelivery is the final step in our product design process at ProductPlan. Here we conduct our handoff ceremony with engineering. What do we hand off? Annotated Figma files with prototypes to provide engineers with proper expectations of flows. Importantly, this is also when we work with sales and marketing to ensure deliverables are known and understood. We then deliver marketing materials for landing pages, email campaigns, social media content, and more.\nTools used\nI’d be remiss not to mention the tools we use during the product design process at ProductPlan. We employ the following:\nFigma for design and prototypes\nMiro for cross-team collaboration\nDovetail for research aggregation\nAdobe for animation references for our engineering team\nMetabase and Google Analytics for statistics around usage\nPendo for first time user experiences and new feature onboarding\nFinal thoughts\nAt ProductPlan, we are deeply committed to providing the best possible user experience. Our approach involves transparency, collaboration, and a systematic design methodology. We create a safe space for exploration and conversations, allowing each team member to contribute genuinely and perform their best. While we strive for continuous improvement, we owe much of our progress to the consistently insightful feedback from our customers. Together, we are building better features and enhancing our product!\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/productplan-approach-to-product-design/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925715370,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Standouts vs. Status Quo: 10 Traits of an Elite Product Leader","text":"\n Product teams are as diverse as the products they help bring into existence. While backgrounds and experience can vary broadly, all product managers come to work with a similar core foundational skillset that organizations rely on to build successful products.\nProduct leaders (e.g., CPOs, VPs of product, head of product, etc.) have the weighty challenge of bringing these diverse PMs together to form a cohesive team with a unified vision and aligned goals.\nOf course, not all product leaders are created equal. Some stand out from the rest as exemplary in the role.\nWhat separates the average product leader from the superstars who energize their teams and provide the right leadership, support, and space to enable teams to create and steer products to successful outcomes? In this post, we’ll explore some of the key skills and qualities that elite product leaders share, and we’ll also identify what separates the standouts from the status quo.\nWhat elite product leaders have in common\nTruly great product leaders share ten key attributes we’ll examine more closely here.\n1. Driven to lead\nElite product leaders are natural-born leaders. They are driven to lead. Not only do they know what needs to be done, they know how to get it done. They make prioritization look easy. But they also trust their team and nurture their people to lead. Leadership in and of itself is a core value. \nBill George, the former CEO of Medtronic and senior fellow at Harvard Business School, knows a thing or two about cultivating an environment of leadership. (George wrote several books that explore leadership: True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership and Discover Your True North.) “The role of leaders,” he contends, “is not to get other people to follow them but to empower others to lead.”\n2. See alignment as a cornerstone\nAn elite product leader stays firmly aligned to vision, strategy, and an organization’s goals. The alignment of all three is considered sacred and unshakeable. But more important: this alignment is shared. And it becomes the glue that unites the product team. \n“It’s no longer good enough to build products customers love. Elite product organizations must work across multiple dimensions, building products customers love, that achieve the company’s objectives at the lowest cost and best use of resources. Elite product leaders are the multi-dimensional connector across teams, functions, and all levels of the company hierarchy.” \n(Connie Kwan, How to Run an Elite Product Organization)\nProduct Manager to Product Leader\n3. Powerful storytellers\nA product leader holds a strategic and visible spot for the product team within the company and has a great deal of power in setting the tone companywide. An elite product leader understands the power of effective storytelling and why getting the story right and telling it well are so important for product teams. They use stories to simplify, engage emotions, and be memorable. And when these three boxes are checked, that story becomes shareable–an ideal outcome for a product team. \nIn Building a Storybrand, Donald Miller suggests that the job of product is “not simply getting products to market, but also communicating why customers need those products in their lives.” Without a strong story that persuades and sticks in people’s minds, even the best products can be drowned out in a crowded marketplace. \n4. Seek meaningful engagement\nElite product leaders know how to motivate members of their team by meaningfully engaging them. They also encourage, support, and mentor their team members. They understand their people and know what makes them tick. And they see team members as individuals who bring unique skillsets and experiences to the group. \nElite product leaders understand that building a great product begins with building a great product team that scales alongside product vision and goals. \n5. Offer ongoing connection\nProduct leaders are often responsible for hiring. Building the right team culture begins here but doesn’t end here. It’s an ongoing, intentional effort to cultivate the right culture. That intention might take setting a weekly goal for customer interactions or a daily time to check in on product usage. (Note: Elite leaders use their products.)\nBuilding a truly great team must be as intentional as building a truly great product. Elite product leaders know that “great product teams don’t build themselves or come together by chance or accident. Instead, it takes a dedicated leader to envision, shape, and nurture the team and its members so it can grow and scale with the products they manage.” \n6. Intentionally build community\nThere are many ways to generate an intentional product community. The easiest way is to relevant read books and articles and listen to podcasts. Join groups that create an external product bridge. Connect internally within the product group by launching a book club or setting up a casual monthly or biweekly meetup to talk shop. Merge internal and external communities by attending conferences together. \n7. Data-driven (but not data-obsessed)\nData is essential for a product team to make informed decisions. But sometimes, there’s so much data coming at the team; it’s challenging to know what to focus on or how to manage it so that it can be useful. \nElite product leaders can skillfully balance the flow of data, get the right systems to manage it, and identify what’s most important. \n8. Extraordinary communicators\nIt really can’t be overstated just how essential strong communication skills are to the entire product team, but especially product leaders. Elite leaders can strike a strategic balance in knowing what to say, when, how to say it and to whom. Getting it right (or wrong) can make or break a product. \n9. Amplify efficiency\nIncreasing efficiency across product teams and organizations is the hallmark of product operations. To elite product leaders, this means long-term sustainability and effectiveness. This efficiency stems from “implementing standardization around metrics, infrastructure, business processes, best practices, budgeting, and reporting.” Further, it means enabling product teams with the tools and processes they need to do their jobs successfully. \n10. Customer-driven (borderline customer-obsessed)\nBeing customer-driven is a hallmark of a successful product organization. That being said, an elite product leader might be seen as more customer-obsessed. They take customer feedback and the customer experience very seriously. And they use this feedback to inform strategic product decisions about which goals to pursue. \nHow do elite leaders view mistakes?\nElite product leaders are not superhuman. They certainly make mistakes along the way. But they don’t bury those mistakes or distance themselves as quickly as possible from their mistakes. They circle back and poke at them, dissect them, and hold them up to the light to learn from them. Mistakes become teachers. Mistakes provide valuable insights. Leaders know this, embrace this, and put this value into action.\n“Failure is not the opposite of success. It’s a stepping stone to success.”\nFinal Thoughts\nEffective product teams that build great products are a direct result of an elite product leader.\nDownload How to Structure Your Product Management Organization for Success➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-leader-traits/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925796690,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Taking the Leap: Why Product Managers Make Better Entrepreneurs","text":"\n \n \n \n \n \n Co-founder, Board Member \n at \n ProductPlan \n \n \n \n \n \n I’ve spoken with so many product managers who have a dream of becoming an entrepreneur or launching their own product one day. Every one of those conversations is exciting because that was my dream too.\nAfter a decade of working with others to launch successful SaaS products, I took the plunge to launch a startup in 2013. As I continued to help launch products, I realized that I was prepared to dive into entrepreneurial life myself.\nOur surveys at ProductPlan support this trend of product managers (PM) desiring the entrepreneurial life. In ProductPlan’s 2021 State of Product Management Report, we learned that 27% of product managers said they wanted to start their own company in the next 10 years.\nI also spend time with students at different technology programs—it’s becoming more common for many of them to want to embark on a product management career. Many of them also one day want to start their own company.\nIt makes sense. Product managers are usually high-performing people who have a variety of skills in different areas. Many of them are natural risk-takers. I believe that product management is a great training ground for entrepreneurship.\nI’m not claiming it was easy leaping into entrepreneurship. Being an entrepreneur and running a new company is hard work. Startups fail more often than not. But the experience I gained through my product management career lowered my risk and made it “easier” to find success.\nWhile there are plenty of examples of product managers becoming founders, it’s not the only path. Many CEOs of well-known companies have had product management experience during their careers. For example, Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, was the first product manager for Google’s AdSense.\nHere are the reasons I think a career in product management makes you especially prepared to start your own company or perhaps lead as a CEO.\n4 Ways Product Managers Make Better Entrepreneurs\n1. We have a holistic view of a business and markets.\nFew jobs have as much exposure to other roles and departments within a company as product management. Because we need to work with so many stakeholders and understand markets, we have a more holistic view of a business.\nThink of everyone you need to interact with to go to market with a new product or feature. You might need to engage with product development, sales, customer service, finance, department heads, key customers, strategic partners, and more in many organizations.\nAs a product manager at early-stage startups, my prior experience taught me that a business is more than a product or a set of features. It’s the entire business model that requires collaboration and effort from many different departments. For example, your outstanding product won’t get far without understanding the customer acquisition and sales model.\nIn my case, there were many areas of our business model I understood well. Through my previous careers, I understood finance, marketing, and of course, how to launch a product. However, because of my limited sales experience, I had to educate myself to become our first salesperson and sales leader. My prior experience (and belief) taught me that I could learn it.\n2. We can talk with customers and find pain.\nThe best product managers and entrepreneurs think of themselves as finders of pain. It’s this skill that I believe leads both to the most successful products.\nBefore starting ProductPlan, I used the customer discovery techniques I learned validating several prior products, including GoToMeeting. Greg, my Co-founder, and I talked with potential customers to identify their pain and validate that the problem we’d detected was significant enough for them to want to solve.\nMy experience as a product manager gave me the awareness to ask the right questions and dig in and understand customer pain well enough to design a solution that customers would want to buy. This experience allowed me to spot repeatable problems to solve – not simply for a few customers but for a market. We also discovered underlying needs and desires that helped us craft a value proposition that really resonated with our market.\nUltimately, I believe our product management experience helped us get an innovative product to market quickly, on a budget, without significant pivots, and with paying customers immediately. Without that experience, we may have made a few more missteps.\n3. We understand how to prioritize.\nIn any startup, the opportunities appear unlimited. So many potential product directions. So many potential customer segments. Which to choose?\nSuccessful entrepreneurs know how to go after the opportunities that really matter and reject 90% of the other distractions. They can focus on a specific product for a specific market.\nI’ve spoken with first-time startup founders who don’t possess these skills. They talk about their products being for “everyone.” They believe that they can get a robust product out the door in a couple of months with a small outsourced engineering team. When asked about revenue models, they say, “we’ll worry about that later.”\nProduct managers already know not to make these mistakes. We understand how to think about a minimum viable product, understand agile development, and prioritize using a mental model of value versus cost.\nWe’ve also been burned in the past with optimistic delivery dates. We’ve taken risks on features that received yawns from customers. We have lots of battle scars. This experience can accelerate a product manager’s success when they take the leap into entrepreneurship.\n4. We can communicate.\nWriting and verbal communication skills are essential as an entrepreneur. The ability to persuade – whether during a sale to a prospect or a potential investor – is one of the skills that sets the best entrepreneurs apart.\nAll those hours you’ve spent toiling over business cases and one-pagers as a product manager –  it pays off as an entrepreneur.\nWe also can communicate in outcomes. Product managers are data-driven and use outcome-driven thinking to grow the business. As a result, as startup founders, we stand a better chance of focusing on features and initiatives that move the business forward and motivate a team.\nAnd we say “No” a lot. This is a skill that takes a lot of subtlety and practice to get right.\nBut…Product Management and Entrepreneurship are Different\nAs I mentioned previously, there were many skills I wish I had before I started a company, including selling experience. There were many other ways that the two paths are different.\nEntrepreneurs have final authority. As a product manager, you make the product decisions, but you’re the master of none. First, you need to influence through persuasion because you likely won’t have a team working directly for you. Next, you need to collaborate with stakeholders and work with cross-functional teams. You can’t act autonomously. As an entrepreneur, you make the decisions and enforce them because, well, you’re the founder. It can be stressful sometimes. You, of course, still need to influence and convey your vision, but the final decision is yours to make.\nEntrepreneurs take the risk — and reap the reward. As a product manager working for others, I was playing with someone else’s money. I took strategic risks, but if the product failed at the end of the day, I would still (likely) have an income. Fortunately, the products I launched and managed were successful. Yet as an entrepreneur, I’m now taking all the risk (well, me and my co-founder).\nLeaping into entrepreneurship can be scary. But my product management experience gave me the confidence and skills to become a startup founder and launch my own product with the help of so many others. It helped me prepare for the eventual decisions and stresses as an entrepreneur. If starting your own company is an ambition for you one day, I believe that your product management experience lowers the risk enough for you to leap too.\nYou can read more about the founding story of ProductPlan in my book ‘How to Find Product-Market Fit Faster.’\n \t\n","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-entrepreneur/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925797892,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Best Way to Price SaaS Products","text":"\n Pricing SaaS products presents unique challenges—and opportunities—for product and marketing teams.\nIn the past few years, I’ve had a hand in setting pricing for several successful SaaS products, including GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, AppFolio, and ProductPlan. In the next few articles, I’ll review lessons for how to price a product that I’ve learned along the way.\nThis first article is about what I consider to be the #1 most important element for pricing SaaS products: customer value.\nUnderstanding customer value is essential for pricing all software products, but even more so with SaaS.\nRead the Power of SaaS Pricing Experiments ➜\nBecause most SaaS products are priced with a recurring subscription, every month or year your customers reevaluate whether they want to continue subscribing. This makes it even more critical to ensure pricing is in line with the value your customers receive.\nLet me define what I mean by “value.” First, a value can be quantitative, such as time saved or additional revenue earned. Measuring this is straightforward, and is the basis of Return on Investment calculations. If your product is B2B SaaS, you are likely already factoring this into your pricing decision.\nBut here is the tricky part: Value can also be qualitative, such as pain relief or lifestyle benefits your product provides. By thoroughly understanding and documenting this sometimes nebulous qualitative value through customer interviews, you can begin to narrow in on possible pricing models and a price range.\nIt’s understanding this qualitative value that can help product managers set their product apart from the competition.\nI believe that customer value should be the primary consideration for your price and pricing model. Not features. Not what competitors charge. And definitely not your costs.\nPricing SaaS Products: A Case Study\nWhen we were determining pricing for GoToMeeting, I interviewed dozens of potential customers to gain a deep understanding of customer pain and the value they might receive from conducting online meetings with our concept. We discovered:\nCost and time savings from reduced or eliminated travel (quantitative value)\nCost savings from switching to our solution versus expensive per-minute pricing of existing solutions (quantitative value)\nIncreased usage of online meeting technology because users were no longer tied to per-minute charges (quantitative value)\nLifestyle benefits from conducting meetings remotely (high qualitative value)\nReduced frustration by eliminating complicated online meeting solutions (high qualitative value)\nBy understanding these quantitative and qualitative values, we developed GoToMeeting’s unique $49 “All You Can Meet” flat-rate pricing (an industry-leading innovation at the time).\nPricing and your customers\nThe pricing model directly relates to the pain and frustration we heard from prospective customers in our interviews – the current solutions were difficult to budget because the per-minute charges varied so widely. The buyer experienced sticker shock every month. Therefore, peace of mind was another qualitative value we could provide customers with our pricing model.\nWhile it’s hard to assign a dollar amount to qualitative values, these are the benefits that ultimately made GoToMeeting a no-brainer for millions of customers.\nBecause the product was SaaS, we had the flexibility to price our product differently from the competition and create a unique product in the market. In a sense, we made pricing a part of the product. It became a differentiating feature that marketing promoted heavily.\nMost product managers already know that finding the right price is more art than science. However, if you thoroughly understand the value of your SaaS product, you can delight customers, provide competitive differentiation and ultimately launch a more profitable product.\nIn the next articles, I’ll describe other lessons for pricing SaaS products including how to develop unique pricing models and several tips for setting the right price.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/best-way-to-price-saas-products/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925716104,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Challenge of the Feature Factory","text":"\n Does your product team celebrate launching that feature they’ve spent the last three months working on and then never give it another thought until it breaks? Is the senior leadership at your organization constantly ordering you to work on the top 10 priorities that change every other day? Are you too busy to reflect on how your product team can work better together? Then you probably have to begin to face the challenges of being in a feature factory.\nWhat is a feature factory?\nJohn Cutler coined the term feature factory upon hearing a software development friend complain that he was “just sitting in the factory, cranking out features, and sending them down the line.” \nThe term has gained traction ever since. And even with all the bad-mouthing that feature factories have received since John originally coined the term, they still exist.\nProductPlan’s 2023 State of Product Management Report found that 54% of roadmaps are designed around outputs. Only 43% communicate outcomes. \nWho knows what the other 3% focus on…\nWhat happens when a product team is a feature factory\nSo are feature factories all that bad? After all, you’re producing a lot of features. Isn’t that a good thing? Not always, no. Your unrelenting focus on pushing features out to market results in multitasking, over-utilization, and the hard-core environment that only Elon Musk would love.\nWays to know your team is a feature factory:\nYou produce a lot of features, but you don’t always know how they relate to each other and if they produce a viable solution.\nYour product becomes too complicated to use. You constantly add features and never remove any.\nYour product becomes too difficult to maintain. When you furiously add features without considering how they work with existing features, you end up with a maintenance nightmare.\nYou introduce many features, but you never take the time to reflect on how to improve them. Instead of iterating, you move on to the next big thing.\nYou’re more likely to introduce features solely for the sake of closing a big deal, which leads to several of the issues described above.\nDownload How to Structure Your Product Management Organization for Success➜\nHow does a product team become a feature factory?\nOk, so if feature factories are so bad, why do so many product teams go down that path? Our 2023 State of Product Management Report gave some clear indicators. Per the report: “Reviewing customer feature requests” is the number one source of actionable product ideas (35%).\nThat’s not too surprising because feature requests (usually expressed as a solution) can seem like an easy way to decide what to work on.\nBut when you don’t dig deeper into those requests and identify the underlying problem, you risk hoping on the feature conveyor belt – introducing features with no overarching understanding of why except for “our customers asked for it.”\nRole of senior leadership\nSenior leadership is also a common source of product ideas, according to the report. That source of ideas comes with a big downside – a lack of product manager confidence.\nThe report explained product managers are “five times more likely to rate their confidence [in their ability to identify problems worth solving] at one out of six when ideas come from senior leadership compared to respondents getting their ideas from other sources”\nSuppose senior leadership tells you what to build. In that case, you’re probably not going to be very confident in your ability to identify problems to solve, and you’re more likely to focus on outputs.\nAnother reason teams focus on outputs and risk becoming feature factories because it’s hard to measure outcomes. \nWhen asked if the return on product development investments meets their senior leadership’s expectations, nearly a third of PM’s responding to the survey said, “I don’t know.” Based on the low adoption of tools for post-release evaluation and reporting, you could interpret that as a sign that they aren’t measuring return on investment.\nSo if you don’t have a good way to measure return on investment, the path of least resistance is to measure progress by how much stuff you’ve delivered. As proof of that, 70% of roadmaps most influenced by senior executives focus on communicating outputs over outcomes. \nA final cause of feature factories is a poor execution of your product strategy or lack of a clear product strategy.\nIdeally, your product strategy provides the tie between your business’ goal and objectives and your plans for your product. Suppose you don’t have that guiding north star. In that case, you’re more likely to find yourself whipsawed from one emergency feature release to the next to satisfy the loudest customer or the latest HiPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion). \nFeature factory, here we come. \nHow to avoid the trap\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. There are some simple ways that your product team can avoid the soulless monotony of cranking out features.\nTo start, change how you communicate what you’re building and why. Talk more about the value you’re delivering and less about the specifics of the features you’re working on.\nNext, treat customer requests as feedback – Talk directly to your customers, and learn how to read into their requests to find the underlying problem. After all, customer requests are feedback, not requirements.\nFinally, give product teams a mission – a problem to solve – and let them figure out how to solve it. When the outcome comes from leadership, it should be clear they care about it, so your team will look to how well they’re solving the identified problem as your gauge of success.\nWant more insights like this?\nCheck out our 2023 State of Product Management Report to get in-depth information about where product teams are now and where they’re headed.\nDownload Our 2023 Product Management Report➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/feature-factory-challenges/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925738089,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Difference Between Thought Leadership vs. People Leadership","text":"\n At times, product professionals fail to realize the similarities and differences between thought leadership vs people leadership. A compelling thought leader most likely started as a people leader, such as a manager or a director.\nIn itself, leading is a sought-after position that requires specialized knowledge and experience. Professionals may decide to pursue a leadership position to lead a team and guide them towards primary objectives and milestones. Leaders are the ones that provide all the go-to answers. There are rewards for having the position, both in money and respect. And those in leadership positions have a hard-earned experience that allows them to navigate their colleague towards actionable plans.\nThat said, being a thought leader is close to meaningless if you’re not a people leader, which is one of the primary connections between thought leadership vs people leadership. You can opine all day about the best way, but if it’s not the best way for your people, then it’s a sum-loss game. Even if you are thoughtful with your written pieces and presentations, you miss out.\nThe Start of Thought Leadership\nProduct management is complex. The work is ambiguous. The long hours working on a craft can take a toll if you don’t have the right people behind you.\nProduct leadership requires cross-disciplinary thinking from fields as software development to manufacturing. A vast breadth of insight and the best practices gives a product leader a unique insight. Their point of view combined with their experience brings multiple products from ideation to market. That is how best practices are born, and when leveraged, can make great things happen.\nHopefully, that is how most product professionals advance in their careers. They’ve taken those ideas and put them to work.\nWho in the world is Charlie Munger?\nCharlie Munger is Warren Buffet’s investment partner and has a reputation as a wise investor. He has an impactful way of looking at the world, which he calls mental models.\nOne of the most useful for those who want to work involves the concept of the “Circle of Competence.”\n“You have to figure out what your aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes, and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.\nWhen the ego goes into the wrong place, operating outside of an individualized circle of competence has disastrous results.\nEasing the transition of leadership\nProduct leaders need to implement best practices and stay inside the organization’s circle of competence. Though imposter syndrome may affect people differently, product leaders need to feel empowered to utilize their product experience and translate that knowledge into their new role.\nWhether it’s a new company or a new team, these professionals need to show empathy towards the company culture. Newly hired leaders must respect the company culture and exhibit a level of empathy towards their new team. The leadership transition also affects employees, so an effective leader knows how the change affects their colleagues.\nTaking Your Thoughts Into New Territory\nIf a tree falls into the woods and no one hears it, does it make a sound?\nLet’s adapt the famous question into one that fits “people leadership.”\n“If you have a best practice, and it doesn’t change the culture, is it a best practice at all?”\nBeing good at what you do is a given. You’ve earned that experience in your career. None of that matters if you can’t relate to your current environment.\nTalking about your ideas is useless if it doesn’t affect the company culture.\nIt’s about managing relationships. People have to respect what you bring to the table. If they don’t see you as credible, your value decreases.\nIf your ideas don’t connect, then you are that tree mentioned earlier. Best practices are fascinating thought exercises, but if they don’t affect change, that is all they are.\nDigital Transformation Blues\nEnterprises struggle with transformation. Anyone that has done this work long enough has seen the following play out:\n The new hire comes on board and promises a digital transformation within eighteen months.\n They come in with all sorts of bonafide – they’ve worked with all the essential companies.\n The leader makes a big speech and gets the team fired up.\n Then nothing happens.\nLet’s make a couple of bets for this transformation: the teams have a communication issue and find themselves siloed. They have the best practices and experience, but they can’t connect.\n The behavior does not align with the values of the company.\n When asked about it, they get process documentation, if anything at all.\nThese examples show how thought leadership can happen without culture shifts.\nCulture-Shifting Practices\nNow, here is an example of effectively applying culture-shifting practices.\n1.) The leader comes on board and promises a digital transformation within eighteen months.\nWhen the leader comes in, they avoid the splash. Instead of trying to grab the spotlight, they spend time listening. They do so to understand the culture they are working with, where their experience can help, and where it won’t.\n2.) The leader comes in with all sorts of bonafide – they’ve worked with all the “essential” companies.\nInstead of leading with company names, the leader leads with experience. They tell stories that pair with the listening tour and give the folks around them a feel of who they are. Along the way, they find minor problems and fix them.\n3.) The leader makes a big speech and gets the team fired up.\nThe leader distributes the work. Instead of putting themselves out front immediately, they learn. After finding the actual difference makers, they get their buy-in before going to the group. This way, they know they have support at all levels.\nAvoid agile-fall\nThose three changes put culture first. The company gets to be better at making changes because the changes tie to a realistic vision.\nFor example, when shifting from waterfall to agile, go to each team and understand what waterfall did for them. After understanding each team’s waterfall processes, you can develop a business case to sell your agile product management strategy. Listen, apply your experience, and get buy-in. If you are running more reviews of the process than retrospectives, you’ve fallen for the trap.\nWe’ve all been on teams where agile turned into “agile-fall,” and everyone sours on the process.\nChange is hard, and our thoughts need to evolve. The process is iterative, and when you treat it that way, you’ll get better.\nDownload the Product Planning Process Guide➜\nMinding the Gap: Thought Leadership vs. People Leadership\nChanges are an evolutionary process. They aren’t something that happens only once. Leading doesn’t mean being curious and going to make the conference talk.\nRemember this:\n“If you have a best practice, and it doesn’t change the culture, is it a best practice at all?”\nThe concept also applies to ourselves.\nMaking an impact once is good, but we want to expand our circle of competence.\nThere is an opportunity to build that muscle by working within our culture, seeking new problems, and staying curious.\nWhen you do that, you shift. You go from one experience to multiple.\nRemember, leadership is ambiguous, and what you do here won’t always get you to the place you want to go. The more product narratives you have, the more you can exhibit your competence around the organization. Every cycle of change is another opportunity to add to your toolkit. Please focus on the culture, and cultivate it like a plant. From there, you’ll see things develop.\nThat development helps develop yourself as a realized thought leader. An influential thought leader can tell a product narrative in multiple ways while shedding light on the problem from different angles. They can level up to standard best practices by being flexible.\nWe can’t avoid the will to lead. It’s a part of us being leaders. Please don’t deny it, as it may lead you to overdo it. It isn’t harmful to use it to grow opportunistically. It’s essential, however, to stay curious to find ways to develop your craft further.\nChange is Hard, so Use it to Get Better.\nChange is hard, and our thoughts need to evolve. It’s an iterative process, and when you start treating it that way, you’ll get better.\nThat said, being a thought leader is close to meaningless if you’re not a people leader.\nAs you do that, you’ll craft the best environment to increase productivity from your team and improve your abilities. Remember, when the team gets better, you get better.\nChange is hard, and it takes time. Coming in and dropping in ideas isn’t going to do anything. Being able to take those ideas, help them evolve, and make them relevant is the step to leveling up your career.\nCulture isn’t just something that comes from best practice documents. It is living, growing, breathing. When you treat yourself, the team, and your career that way, you’ll find yourself in a position to take it to the next level.\nDownload the Toolkit for Product Managers➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/thought-leadership-people-leadership/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925800045,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Essentialist’s Way to Building Better Products","text":"\n “Am I working on the right things?”\n“How can I fit it all in?”\nI find myself asking these questions almost daily, both in my personal and professional life. How can I spend my time working on the things that matter most?\nEven with the world in upheaval and our shift to distributed work, these questions are still top of my mind. With my trips, events, and other plans postponed for now, there are so many other things that can potentially fill up my time in this time of uncertainty.\nMany of us live our lives doing 100 things at the same time. Trying to please everyone. Trying to do it all. I certainly have fallen into this camp. As a result, we scatter our energy and don’t make significant, meaningful, or satisfying progress on any of those 100 things.\nRecently, I really enjoyed reading the book Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown and gave a talk about the essentialism concepts internally at ProductPlan. I highly recommend it for product leaders and anyone who aspires to make the biggest possible contribution to their work and life.\nIf I could summarize this book in one sentence it would be:\n“Less but better.” \nNow, if there’s a single statement for product managers to live by, that would be it.\nI’ve often thought that product leaders can learn lessons about building better products from the methods we use to prioritize our personal life. So let’s look at the concept of “essentialism.”\nDownload The Essentialist Product Manager ➜\nA Quick Primer on Essentialism\nAccording to the book, an “essentialist” is someone who lives by design, not by default. An essentialist isn’t reactive, but rather makes choices deliberately by separating the vital few from the trivial many.\nEssentialism is an approach for determining where your highest value is, and then executing on it—to the exclusion of many other activities. An essentialist says “No” a lot.\nAccording to McKeown, essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done.\nDoes that sound a lot like what product managers do every day as we prioritize what to build?\nAn essentialist says, “I choose to work on only a few things that really matter.” By carefully choosing these few things that matter (for our products and our lives), we can make great leaps forward. Moreover, we’ll live a life that feels in control and one that matters.\nThe “Non-essentialist” Product Manager\nAccording to McKeown, there are ways that a “non-essentialist” thinks. As I read the book, I found several parallels to ineffective product management. Here are a few patterns that might represent “non-essential” thinking by product managers:\n“It’s all-important.” A non-essentialist product manager will try to be all things to all people. They will struggle to fit it all in – all the meetings, feeling like they are responsible for everything. They are the product expert with all the answers, and no decisions can be made without their input.\n“More.” A non-essentialist product manager will focus on “more.” It’s undisciplined and reactive. More features to beat the competition. More saying “yes” without thinking first. Or saying Yes because it’s the easier path. What’s the harm of fitting in one more user story?\n“Are we working on the right things?” A non-essentialist product manager, because they take on too much, will often feel out of control. They’re unsure if they’re working on the right things, and as a result, will ultimately feel overwhelmed and unsatisfied.\nIf any of those statements sound familiar, that’s OK. We all fall into that trap occasionally. All of us that are building products, will at some point feel or exhibit these patterns.\nYet there are ways of thinking and organizing our days so we don’t get to that point—after all, don’t we all want a sense of purpose, ease, and satisfaction in our work?\nThe Mindset of the Essentialist Product Manager\nHow can you foster the mindset of an essentialist product manager to avoid those traps? Here are four lessons I took away from the book that you can apply to your personal and product life.\n1. Create space for thinking.\nFor most product managers, our days are filled with video meetings, calls, writing emails, writing stories, interruptions on Slack, and so on. With the recent switch to distributed work, we have been given this opportunity to create time in our day for strategic and creative thinking without the constant interruptions.\nWhat would that look like? An essentialist creates time in their day for insights and contemplation, rather than putting out fires all day.\nThis process also applies to our working space. Many of us are now working from home—is your space one where you can focus? Is it pleasant to be in? Since you might be spending about one-third of your day there, why not make it one that inspires you to think creatively? For me, taking a break during my day for outside time (a walk, run, or even a stroll in my backyard) is a great way to process what to work on next.\n2. Define your product’s purpose.\nWhen was the last time you thought through your product’s purpose and mission? The OKRs you’ve been managing? How is your product differentiated from the competition? What is your product best at, and how can you double down on that?\nWith so much economic disruption, you can no longer take it for granted that your product’s vision and mission will be the correct one going forward.\nNow is a time of reset for reflection on those things. What you (and your team) decide will set the stage for which initiatives are the most important things that you choose to work on next.\nDownload the Product-Market Fit Book ➜\n3. Implement the minimum product.\nThis is the opposite of the “it’s all-important” mentality. I’ve written a lot about the minimum viable product (or the minimum sellable product) that provides value to customers. Now is the time to take that philosophy to heart.\nI recently wrote about decluttering your product backlog. Revisit those epics in your backlog and scale those back. What will give your customers the most value with 50% of the effort you previously estimated?\n4. Pause. Say No.\nA non-essentialist product manager will pause before eventually saying “Yes.” An essentialist says “No” a lot, focusing on the vital few. Product managers will need to do this with empathy and reasoned explanations about why the answer is No (or “not yet”).\nAdditionally, it’s not only about saying “No” to feature requests. But rather, not committing to projects and decisions that do not lead you towards the greater goal. By saying No, and having a well thought out justification, you will foster more respect among your peers, stakeholders, and customers. Help them understand what the tradeoffs are. What will they (or the company) be giving up if you choose one path versus another?\nIf you have items in your product backlog that you now realize you won’t get to within the next six months, that’s probably a sign that you’re committing to too much. Likewise, if your day is back-to-back meetings, perhaps you can review your schedule next week and opt-out of a few.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nTakeaways—Claim Back Your Time.\nThese are only a few ways that product teams and entrepreneurs can introduce an essentialist mentality into their day. In talking with other startup founders and product leaders I often hear the challenges of “not enough time” as a common refrain.\nPerhaps with essentialism, we can claim back that time, work on what matters, and make better products as a result.\nDownload the Free Product Leadership Book\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/essentialism-product-management/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925732777,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Evolution of Product-Led Growth","text":"\n The evolution of product-led growth may seem to be a recent trend at software companies, but the underlying concepts have been in full force for years. \nBeing product-led is a path to success: we’ve seen consistently that product-led companies achieve faster growth once they achieve scale. Companies like Slack, Zoom, Calendly, Hubspot, and Dropbox are often mentioned as examples. But there are thousands of others that have achieved faster growth through similar methods.\nI’ve had the fortune of working on teams launching some of the early SaaS products going back almost 20 years. All of them baked product-led growth into their business models. \nIn this article, I’ll give you some examples of product-led growth from my own experience. And I’ll additionally provide a few thoughts on where it’s all heading.\nBut first I’ll quickly explain what I mean when I say “product-led”. To me, it means that the company is thinking product-first and is focused on the customer experience. It means they use the product itself to drive growth through new sales and expansion revenue. \nIn my experience, the best companies build the business model to help the product achieve faster growth without adding a commensurate number of salespeople to the mix. Rather than the previous generation of software companies with high friction sales models, in a product-led company the customers themselves foster the growth.\nMy Experience with GoToMeeting: Growth Built-In\nIn 2004 I helped launch GoToMeeting, one of the earliest web-based products with a SaaS model. The product was acquired by Citrix, and later by LogMeIn. I was on the team conducting market validation and I led the early customer discovery interviews. I then wrote the product requirements that outlined the features, value propositions, and business model.\nWe took our learnings from launching two earlier products at the same company and created a model integrating several characteristics that, while we didn’t call it product-led at the time, clearly were product-led. These characteristics helped create a wildly successful product and a model for future companies: \nSelf-service model. Customers could use the free trial and purchase one or a few licenses with a credit card. We experimented zealously and continued to optimize the purchase flow and experience. While this seems like a no-brainer for so many software companies today, at the time it was an uncommon approach and helped our rapid growth.\nEasy to get started. The product was easy to get up and running without any training.\nViral licensing model. Participants could join the meetings for free. This allowed viral awareness within organizations because it was so easy to get started. This then fostered growth as participants decided to host their own meetings and purchased a license. \nCustomer-focused pricing model. Our “all you can meet” pricing model was innovative at the time and was so appealing to customers who were used to the unfriendly meeting models such as per-participant / per-minute\nProduct-Led Growth at ProductPlan\nMy company ProductPlan launched our product roadmap platform in 2013 and we baked in product-led growth from the very beginning. In our early market validation, we discovered that product managers wanted to try the product on their own before buying. For that reason, we launched with a completely self-service model and didn’t hire our first salesperson until years later in 2016. \nHere are some of the characteristics of ProductPlan that make us product-led.  \nEducational focus with inbound marketing. Our low-key educational approach to content allows product managers to learn about us through high-quality articles, books, webinars, and other content. They choose to engage with a trial when they are ready.\nFully-functional Free Trial. Product managers can sign up for a free trial without a credit card and get access to all the features in our entry-level plan. \nEasy to get started. Product managers could build (or import) their first roadmap in minutes – our interface is laser-focused on getting started fast. We deliver value in minutes, even before purchasing the product.\nSelf-service purchasing model. Since we launched in 2013, customers have been able to purchase licenses without contacting us. This makes it possible for product managers and others in larger organizations to “go rogue,” and purchase ProductPlan (sometimes using their own credit card). This approach helps plant the seeds within an organization for future growth.\nFree viewer licenses. When a product manager shares their roadmap for free to others (including executives), awareness within other teams grows – they are then inspired to purchase their licenses to create and edit their own roadmaps.\nEasy to add more licenses. For our basic plan customers can add more licenses without contacting us – as awareness grows internally it’s easy to add a license so new people can get started immediately.\nNetwork effect. As adoption grows within an organization, the value of ProductPlan increases. As more product teams adopt the solution, we’re seen as a platform and the need for standardization across the organization becomes important. The standardization included in our enterprise plans evolves to be a requirement. These features provide even more value for larger organizations and an upgrade path for additional recurring revenue for us.\nI’m not saying that we’ve nailed product-led growth. We have a lot more to learn and do. And our model continues to evolve. Today we have an enterprise account management team and more options for trying the product, including coordinated team trials, but our core product-led approach is still there.\nCore Principles Going Forward\nWhat I’ve described so far are a few basics from my experience that companies can adopt to become more product-led. My opinion is that we can focus on a couple of core principles to become more product-led in our companies. A couple of my favorite products can provide some insight. \nThe first core principle is to deliver an outstandingly positive user experience. A great example of this is Slack. Like many of you, we’re a customer, and it was their thoughtful focus on creating a simple and fun way for our team to communicate that created rapid and enthusiastic adoption. \nThe other core principle is some kind of viral growth built into the business model – often accelerated by existing customers. I’ve been a customer of Calendly’s meeting scheduling tool for a while now because it makes it so easy to find meeting times. I chiefly use it for scheduling calls with customers. It’s the virality of their product that fascinates me—every time I send an invitation to someone to find a meeting time, I’m essentially sending an email to a new prospective customer for them. The product doesn’t need an overly aesthetic UI to have product-led growth. It’s so easy to get started that this product gains fast adoption. \nFor those of us in the software world, most of us want to evolve to be product-led. By looking at these examples you hopefully are inspired to build growth levers into your product and business model. Have other examples? I’d love to hear what you think.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/evolution-product-led-growth/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925704026,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Key to Achieving Change Management Buy-In","text":"\n Getting change management buy-in is not easy, but we’re only delaying the inescapable when we resist change. Whether it’s driven by economics, technology, politics, or the environment—those massive undercurrents can at best be held at bay before reality sets in.\nMost organizations are resistant to change by default. Inertia, process, bureaucracy, and governance are often cited as the primary hurdles. But fear and uncertainty also play an often unspoken-yet-prominent role. The bigger the company, the harder it can be to make even the smallest fundamental shifts.\nYet, those same large organizations face the most risk by not adapting quickly and intentionally. Smaller, younger firms are by nature more agile, and it’s easier to get change buy-in. But small teams also have less to lose. It’s because larger, older companies have so much more at stake that failing to change can be that much more consequential.\nFor example, my mission in my previous role at a company with over 30,000+ employees was to create a formal change management process or track record to lean on for their CRM system, Salesforce.com, and create a center of excellence around optimizing the firm’s usage of this critical tool.\nThis wasn’t my first time helping an organization improve its Salesforce.com utilization. I’ve done this for multiple firms from a project management/PMO perspective. I’ve also had experience in change management, having spent eight years previously facilitating those. \nLet’s look at the critical steps that can affect the fate of significant transformations for organizations and successfully change management buy-in. \n3 Critical Considerations That Affect Change Management Buy-in\n1. Intentional thinking from the start.\nOne fatal flaw many big change initiatives make is letting things “into the wild” before they’re fully baked. However, there might be a follow-on phase to tweak and tailor new tools and processes to the specific impacted groups. Employees won’t always wait until the paint is dry to begin using things.\nI’ll use Slack as an example. The asynchronous communication tool can be a huge boost for efficiency and collaboration. But when left to their own devices, early adopters can create some bad precedents.\nIn this case, if you don’t create the correct channels and train staff how to use Slack properly, it can get out of control. This can both create bad habits and turn people off to the tool before it’s spun up. Yet, a productivity boon can end up as yet another system people use inconsistently.\n2. Anticipating downstream ramifications.\nManagement often initiates changes. A CFO, VP, or a Director thinks there’s a better, cheaper, or faster way to do something. Then they issue an order, and everyone beneath them in the organizational chart deals with the consequences.\nBut managing change by edict is often a recipe for disaster on the ground floor. Executives frequently don’t have much insight into the day-to-day operations of various teams. Thus they can’t begin to recognize the disruption such a shift might cause.\nThe power of working groups is effective. People on the ground are the ones that know what’s going on.\nIdeally, before a suggested change is even approved, the organization conducts a full forensic analysis of the implications for everyone impacted. That includes employees across the company, as well as strategic partners and even customers. The exercise might uncover potential unintended consequences.\nRegardless of how big or small it might be, every change requires a proper communication plan. The key is figuring out how you’re going to engage with everyone, drive adoption, detail the benefits, and get everyone on board.\nIt should detail the rationale for the move along with any new or modified processes. If necessary, hold training or Q&A sessions to ensure the roll-out goes smoothly with minimal turmoil during the transition.\n3. Centralized change management.\nAnother key to successful change management is running it all out of a single unit, be it an ad hoc team, a more permanent center of excellence, or a formal PMO. There are many benefits from this kind of organizational structure.\nFirst, it breaks down silos in a way that’s often unattainable organically. This unit can both communicate across the organizational matrix and identify redundant efforts.\nThis also puts trained practitioners in charge of structuring and facilitating these activities. Since this is what they do, they have the skills, tools, best practices, and resources to make things as seamless and standardized as possible. They also possess the institutional knowledge and expertise to anticipate friction points in advance thus minimizing potential damage via education and well-documented processes.\nMost importantly, utilizing a dedicated change management entity gives a holistic view of every major initiative. Regardless of where it began, keep in mind the entire organization and larger ecosystem during execution.\nRead the Strategic Roadmap Planning Guide ➜\n4 Steps to Achieve Change Management Buy-in\nThese are the steps for starting things off on the right foot.\n1. Survey the landscape.\nUntil you’re on the inside, it’s hard to know who the real players are. Nor do you know where the power centers lie and which baggage and political legacies influence projects. You see which names are being dropped, who people defer to, who made previous critical decisions or threw up roadblocks.\nAt one point, I conducted 40 interviews across various groups to get the land lay but could have done more. Once I’ve identified these stakeholders, then I can understand how to best engage with them.\nI want to emphasize that it’s imperative to make sure you get things right when evaluating senior management. You need to know their motivations, concerns, and what they value most.\nEmotional intelligence is such a key factor as a leader. You can talk about industry knowledge and business process. Still, if you don’t have the emotional intelligence of people around you and their drivers, then you can’t figure out how to motivate them in the best way.\nAdditionally, not everyone wants to receive information in the same way, nor do we all process it similarly. I make a point of asking key stakeholders right off the bet how they like to be communicated with, so I can try and meet them where they want to be.\n2. Define and articulate a vision.\nNo one’s a fan of change for change’s sake, so the value and purpose of this new role must be crisp, clear, and concise. From the C-suite to the cubicles, everyone should understand why this is important, the steps required, and which benefits the result will bring.\nIdeally, present tailored messaging for different audiences to connect with their pain points and address their concerns. But to do this, you need to know who you’re dealing with.\nI use the Insights method. To follow this method, first place stakeholders along a color spectrum, and then based on that designation, you can see what triggers stress along with the best ways to remedy that state. I do this to create the best chances for a successful interaction by acknowledging their feelings and speaking to them constructively.\nIt’s also critical to not immediately dive into the details but rather to establish broader themes that the change will encompass. These themes might seem obvious at times, but a smart and accurate tagline for the initiative can become a helpful mantra and reference point for the project’s life.\n3. Get change-buy in with a roadmap.\nSignificant changes have a lot of moving pieces and dependencies. To get change buy-in, a project or program roadmap can help illustrate exactly how everything will happen. Using a purpose-built roadmapping tool is the answer to keeping everything organized and a clear vision to stakeholders.\nUsing ProductPlan, I capture every possible backlog item to ensure no requests or requirements get lost in the shuffle. In this central repository, we used ProductPlan to prioritize initiatives. I categorize various things up for consideration before putting them into “buckets” to develop and ship together to create incremental value associated with a particular theme.\nThen I use a cost and complexity versus impact method for evaluating which items should get to the front of the line, and are happy to slot the low-hanging fruit in the front of the queue to deliver more value to stakeholders faster.\nWith prioritized themes set, I build my roadmap. I use lanes for “containers” of specific items, which allows me to keep the roadmap clean and straightforward. Less is more about the level of detail presented to most audiences, but there’s always the option to drill down and get more refined information on a specific roadmap element.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\n4. It’s all about people.\nWhile tools, frameworks, and processes get a lot of attention, at the end of the day, what determines a significant change’s success or failure is how it is embraced and supported by the individual it impacts.\nThe key to change management buy-in is having a clear vision and structure people understand so they see the impact of what you’re trying to do and how it affects them. If you don’t think about how they’re going to go about it, it will never be successful. Without engaging with the people who will use it, that will be your number one failure.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/change-management-buy-in/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925800089,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Key to Defeating Analysis Paralysis on Your Roadmap","text":"\n Thanks to the Internet, there is no unfindable fact. As information is always at the ready, there’s no excuse not to check sources, find corroborating evidence, and research every decision. Our well-instrumented products are delivering a steady stream of data ready to be sliced, diced, and analyzed — leaving many of us with a bad case of analysis paralysis.\nWe can learn from others, quantify opportunities, and calculate results. We can experiment, tweak, and modify whenever we’d like; gauging the effects based on hard numbers instead of guesses and anecdotes.\nBut the challenge is sorting through it all. With so many inputs relentlessly adding to our data, it’s hard to know what’s valuable. We could analyze 24 hours a day and never “finish” anything.\nYou Have Analysis Paralysis\nOur job as product managers requires us to make decisions, prioritize, and plan. While we could theoretically analyze forever, our employers need us to make up our minds and move forward.\nBut how do we know when enough is enough? When do we need to make up our minds instead of conducting another round of research and review? How do we balance backing up our recommendations with data and making those recommendations?\nDespite everyone telling you not to, sometimes you DO need to listen to your gut. Listening is one of the under-appreciated skills of the trade.\nHow did we get into this situation?\nAnalysis paralysis is a bit of a self-inflicted wound. For decades, thought leaders, investors, and board members have been championing getting out of the office, talking to customers, and performing extensive market research.\nThanks to analytics packages, we also now get reams of real-time data on exactly how customers are using our products. We can see how users navigate, their dwell times, and where they click. We can tie back behaviors to conversions and purchases. We can cross-reference it all with demographics, personas, and more.\nAnd don’t forget our newfound love of testing and experimentation. We’re no longer restricted to focus groups. We can unleash A/B testing on the masses to measure real-world reactions to various messages, features, and visuals.\nWe’ve armed ourselves with this supporting data to make our cases bulletproof and overcome imposter syndrome. We don’t want to make mistakes, we want everyone to be happy, and we never want things to be our fault.\nNo one would scrap these tools to go back to the old days of crystal balls and analyst reports. But it has had some pretty significant side effects. Our workloads have grown when it comes to sifting through all the available data. Plus there’s now an expectation that every move we make has statistical evidence predicting its impact.\nDownload Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\nHow Analysis Paralysis Negatively Affects You\nWhen too much data breeds indecision, it takes a toll on your ability to be an effective leader and get your job done.\nIt reduces your confidence. Once upon a time, you felt sure of yourself. Now you only feel prepared if you show up armed with a PowerPoint chock full of charts and graphs backing up your ideas.\nIt slows you down. When challenged, you retreat and pledge to “look at the data” even when the answer is obvious. When there’s a crisis requiring immediate action, your quick-twitch mental muscles have atrophied. As a result, you’ll either make poor decisions or no decisions at all.\nIt presents too many options. There’s a time for data, and a time for common sense. Narrowing the field down to a few choices shouldn’t take long, but overanalyzing things makes this a far more daunting task than necessary.\nIt leaves you unsatisfied. But if you’re always seeking the best solution, you’re never positive there’s not an even better choice still out there. Although there may still be room for improvement, this can rob you of both decisiveness and happiness.\nHow Analysis Paralysis Negatively Affects Your Roadmap\nWhen you’re trapped in this unfortunate state, roadmapping becomes an unproductive grind. Instead of using rational, logical thought, you begin scrutinizing everything. You poke holes in perfectly adequate decisions.\nYou are obsessing over the details. \nOnce you get in the habit of analyzing everything, it’s hard to take any shortcuts. Yet the demands of the job require you to use your time wisely. If you divert too much energy toward items with minimal impact, you either won’t finish, or you’ll give important things short shrift. It simply isn’t scalable.\nYou are aiming for perfection. \nThere’s no point trying to create a perfect product roadmap because there’s no such thing. Even if you somehow manage to do it, that perfection will be short-lived as we know things will change. Shoot for “pretty good” and don’t sweat the small stuff.\nYou are leaving everything on the table.\nWhen your backlog is overflowing with dozens (or hundreds) of items, it’s not easy to whittle things down. But quickly dismissing the undoable, unrealistic, and unnecessary items lets you spend more time on stuff that has a shot of making it on your roadmap.\nYou are damaging your credibility.\nWhile you should leverage data where appropriate, you’re also supposed to be an expert when it comes to your product. If you’re unable to be authoritative about your domain, you’re sowing doubts amongst colleagues and stakeholders.\nRead the Strategic Roadmap Planning Guide ➜\nThe Key to Defeating Your Roadmap Process Analysis Paralysis is Intuition\nShepherding your roadmap along takes a combination of critical thinking and visionary instincts. Here are some tips to keep you from drowning in data by utilizing your intuition.\nTake baby steps.\nRoadmaps are not built in a day— at least they shouldn’t be. A roadmap breaks down the steps to create the ultimate vision of the product, and your roadmapping process has levels of its own. Make them as small and manageable as possible. By notching incremental progress, you can bust through those mental blocks and build momentum in the process.\nSave in-depth analysis for the big stuff.\nNot every decision requires the same level of rigor and research. Data should inform critical strategic moves. But smaller items with limited ramifications can be made without exhaustive study.\nLean on your product vision.\nWith well-defined goals and objectives, many decisions about prioritization should be no-brainers. Don’t make things harder than they need to be. Referring back to themes and North Star metrics can also help.\nEliminate bad options quickly.\nDon’t waste time considering things that you know are bad ideas or unrealistic. Sorting through viable choices is hard enough as it is!\nEmbrace deadlines.\nWhile roadmapping shouldn’t involve split-second decisions, it shouldn’t drag on needlessly. Allocate a limited amount of time for each phase of the process. Force yourself and your stakeholders to make up their minds and move forward.\nGet out of your head.\nSometimes it’s hard to break the cycle of self-doubt and panic about making the wrong decision. So take your quandary to a colleague or trusted friend and bounce it off them. An outside opinion can help you snap out of it and push things along. If you’ve got a team under you, you can also try delegating decisions while retaining veto power.\nMitigate the impacts.\nDon’t put all the available development resources onto a single initiative you’re not quite sure about. Hedge your bets and get to an MVP with a skeleton crew. This way, if it doesn’t pan out, you haven’t gone “all in” on a questionable call.\nRemember, nothing is permanent.\nNear-term items on your roadmap are pretty likely to play out according to plan. But after six months it’s a fair bet that things are going to get shaken up. You’re going to be frequently reviewing and updating your roadmap again. There’s less need to shoot for perfection for those longer-term items.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nTrust yourself.\nYou talk to customers all the time, so you know their problems. Don’t couch statements with “I think.” Command authority and be decisive based on what you know from those conversations.\nFree Yourself from the Analysis Paralysis Trap\nWhen you’ve reached a decision standstill, take a step back. Contemplate whether you genuinely need more information, or if you need just to make a judgement call with your gut and move on. Don’t fear making the “wrong” decisions on your roadmap. Pivoting will happen whether you do all your research or hardly any at all.\nNeed more help deciding what to put on your roadmap?Read the Product Manager's Guide to Prioritization\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/analysis-paralysis-roadmap/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925781612,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Key to Driving Alignment is Remote Collaborative Exercises, Featuring Isabelle Berner VP of Product","text":"\nCollaboration” and “remote work” may not seem like a perfect match. But teams can’t skimp on group work because the days of everyone being in the same room are a distant memory that may never return in quite the same way.\nThere’s still no real replacement for real-time, dynamic discussions and exercises to foster stakeholder alignment. Asynchronous apps have their place, but sometimes you need everyone to debate and sort through things together.\nAccording to Isabelle Berner, Director of Product Management at Def Method, the secret is intentionality. She shared her suggestions and tips during our recent webinar “What’s in Your Product Stack: Collaboration.” Berner, 12-year product management career included stints at Pivotal and Betterment, joining the software development consultancy specializing in Lean and Agile. She is a true believer in the importance of working together on these fundamental product issues.\nAs a consultant, Berner has seen a wide range of collaboration challenges. But she firmly believes “collaboration is the foundation upon which great products are built” and that product managers can be effective catalysts for this activity.\n“The role of facilitating a lot of remote collaboration conversations comes to the product manager. Often product managers have been part of a lot of different teams, and so they maybe have a better read on where collaboration is flawed.”\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nTo Drive Alignment, First Look at Your Team\nEstablishing rapport and respect.\nAn essential ingredient in successful remote collaboration is creating familiarity, comfort, and trust with colleagues before attempting true collaboration.\n“It’s good to spend time with each other one-on-one. Even if it’s on work-related items so we can appreciate each other as human beings,” Berner said. “I love to do walking one-on-ones. Just moving in a direction together and talking about something—it’s nice to stretch your legs and really good for building rapport.”\nBerner also finds standups can be another forum to get teams more comfortable with opening up and talking about important issues.\n“I started seeing the value of standups when I worked at Betterment,” Berner said. “Being tuned in to what everyone’s working on and being able to air any challenges that we’re up against quickly. I’ve carried that with me and never stopped doing standups whenever I’m on a project.”\nHowever, standups come with their own risks to the team dynamic, especially when they become placeholders that morph into some of the larger meetings and conversations the team should have in a more intentional and dedicated forum.\n“Something to mitigate that is to have someone in your standup that’s responsible for putting a pin in those conversations and making sure that they happen because they’re important,” Berner said. “But keeping the standup short and moving along is essential.”\nCreating a feedback-friendly culture.\nBeing open and honest in a work setting doesn’t always come naturally. People don’t want to step on any toes or offend anyone, both out of civility and protect their own careers. But an environment that encourages authentic dialog is essential to avoid groupthink-driven disasters.\nOrganizations need people to challenge assumptions, ask “why” more often, and voice their opinions. And while a suggestion box or an “open door” policy might try to set that tone, people need to walk the walk as well.\n“A great way to establish a culture of giving and receiving feedback is to ask for it. Ask for some specific feedback. Then listen to it and hold yourself accountable to respond to that feedback and show the team how you do that. That’s an easy way to show that feedback can make a big difference.”\nBerner is a big fan of Team Speedback. This one-hour activity is for everyone on the team. Each person writes down a piece of feedback for every other member. They then share that feedback one-on-one in a speed-dating type of format.\n“You have an opportunity to give and receive feedback with every single member of the team. ” Berner said, adding that holding these once every month or two “sets the expectation that this is an OK thing to do, and it makes it a lot less scary if you’re doing it regularly.”\nDownload the stakeholder analysis guide  ➜\nDefine goals and anti-goals.\nA lack of alignment on the objectives of an initiative creates a shaky foundation for any product team. But if the group hasn’t put in a concerted joint effort to build a consensus, chances are team members are operating under various assumptions.\nOne of Berner’s favorite exercises to ensure everyone agrees on what they’re trying to do (and not do) is defining Goals and Anti-Goals.\n“This is a very tactical piece of collaboration. But it really sets teams up to collaborate effectively and build on that if they have an obvious understanding of what their goals are and also a sense of ownership of those goals,” Berners said.\nThe very act of going through this exercise together and putting in the work also strengthens the team’s bonds. This co-laboring creates a stronger consensus since they all witnessed and took part in the process.\n“Working together to achieve a shared objective and a shared set of goals is important towards driving that ownership of goals,” Berner said. “That ties into group idea generation and how to facilitate collaborative conversations.”\nHave a remote collaboration group meeting.\nThis group exercise takes about an hour and requires no preparation. Get the team, and any stakeholders get in the same real or virtual room. This meeting’s goal is for everyone to agree upon what they’re trying to accomplish in the next three-to-six months.\nFirst, give each attendee their own color sticky notes to write down what they understand to be goals. They should also add what they don’t consider essential for this timeframe. This is why it’s essential to establish those dates upfront. Then after everyone’s scribbled ideas down, the group shares their goals or anti-goals round-robin style. This way, each person has an opportunity to share what they think is most important.\n“If people have something similar, group other people’s stickies in that category. And you end up with a series of categories for things that might be considered goals.” Berner said. “Then, from a facilitation standpoint, you can take these goals, summarize them, refine them, and then ultimately vote on which ones are most important as a group.”\nDownload Get Budget Approval on Your Product Stack➜\nInclude ownership\nThe benefits of this exercise go far beyond alignment. Inclusivity in the process also creates a sense of ownership.\n“Being part of the process of coming up with the goals is really empowering for the people on your team,” Berner said. “They’ll understand the goals a lot better because they’ve had these conversations, and they’ll care about them a lot more because they had a hand in choosing what was most important to accomplish.”\nAnti-goals\nAgreeing on the anti-goals is also sometimes even more valuable than the goals themselves.\n“What is something important down the line or something that might be seductive and distracting but that isn’t actually the most important goal for us right now?” Berner says calling out these out-of-scope goals brings additional clarity and focus for everyone and might be the most important discussions of all.\n“When someone in the room thinks an anti-goal should be a goal, surfacing and bubbling up this misalignment and then being able to talk through it and to talk about the relative priority of goals and then make a decision together that something that one person thought should be a goal is actually an anti-goal,” Berner said. “This is where the trickier, more sensitive conversations happen.”\nThe final step is each participant “dot voting” on how to prioritize those categorized goals. “You want to have clarity about not just what your goals are, but what your most important goals are,” Berner added.\nIf this sounds hard or even undoable in a remote or distributed environment, using a virtual whiteboard such as Miro can recreate the actual pen and paper feeling. As an added benefit, there will now be a “permanent” digital record of the exercise’s outcome for newcomers to the team or when someone wants to revisit a decision. That isn’t usually possible since someone else will need the IRL whiteboard for the next meeting in that conference room.\nWhat’s at stake is what matters.\nBy collaboratively aligning around goals, this common understanding filters down into every other aspect of product management. They can even show up in user stories tying small, incremental work to the big picture and laddering up to the business and user value.\nBerner also cited product roadmaps as another instance where this coherent vision can play a role. “Focusing on outcomes versus outputs, but really telling the story through your roadmaps of what those outcomes are, what they mean to your users, and how they benefit the business helps with that communication and connecting people with what they’re building and why it matters.”\nDownload Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\nIt’s also wise to revisit things regularly. Priorities and goals might change or evolve but not automatically flow down through the rest of the organization. Berner recommends using stoplight check-ins to keep everyone on the same page.\n“Have your stoplight check-ins, or just your ten-minute ‘is this on-track/off-track and then address the things that are off-track,” Berner said. “I’ve seen goals sit and get dusty in a corner, and it’s not pretty.”\nBerner also recommends excluding stakeholders from these stoplight check-ins and retrospectives.\n“You want the team not to have to worry about any repercussions if a goal is off-track and just be able to have transparent, problem-solving conversations about getting it back on track,” she said. Spending 15 minutes per week every week or two isn’t much time to confirm things are still headed in the right direction.\nOther Tips for Remote Collaboration Challenges\nReplacing the natural interactions that occur in a physical workplace doesn’t happen by itself. Creating surrogates for watercooler time requires some real effort.\nBerner’s biggest concern is that a distributed workforce isn’t celebrating wins like they usually would, which can impact morale and take some of the fun out of working on an exciting project with peers you like and respect.\n“Getting everyone energized and excited about what’s being accomplished is important,” Berner said. At Def Method, they’ve carved out time in their weekly company meeting for that and have also made little gestures of gratitude, such as sending contributors a care basket after completing something big or putting in the extra effort.\nTo learn about other ways remote collaboration teams can work together, you can watch the entire webinar for free.\n","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/collaborative-remotely/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925724752,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"The Secret to a Successful Product Launch: Tying Your Launch to Your Roadmap Strategy","text":"\n Product professionals spend countless hours researching, prioritizing, and planning, all in the name of creating a successful product launch. And while they may know the problem space like the back of their hand, what we’ve heard time and time again when speaking with product folks is that no stakeholders involved have great visibility into what happens during a launch. And that is true for the product professionals themselves!\nIn fact, a significant number of go-to-market efforts are entirely coordinated by a separate team without the direct involvement of the product organization. To add more complexity to this issue, these teams handling the launch processes typically coordinate their efforts in a tool that is entirely separate from the product roadmap. Therefore, it is no surprise that these teams have information gaps.  \nCommunication silos in the product launch process are a recipe for disaster\nIt can feel worrisome to spend all this time developing a product based on a strategic vision and then have to turn the launch of your precious product or feature to a separate team to bring it to market. However, product professionals care deeply about the success of their product. And the product launch remains a crucial factor in determining overall success. \nYou may solve the customer’s most significant pain point with a feature you just released, but how will the customer know about it? It doesn’t make much sense for the product team to own the research and strategy, disappear during the launch phase and come back to analyze the success. \nAs a result, launch coordinators may have to create time-consuming reports to give updates on the launch. For instance, they have to repeatedly answer which upcoming items have launch plans, when the launch is happening, and if it’s on track. In addition, the siloed launch contributors often have to ask for updates on a release so they can adjust their launch plans and dates accordingly.\nIn short, it becomes one big tangled mess of communication. The good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way. \nPutting all the pieces together: Your roadmap strategy and a successful product launch\nWhat if your launches were all in one place, and they tied directly into your roadmap strategy? With ProductPlan, this is a reality! We wanted to create a deeper connection with your launch planning and roadmap strategy so that your teams have all the information they need in one place.\nLearn how to transform your product launches from chaos to success➜\nOur product and engineering teams have been hard at work enhancing our Launch Management solution with additional functionality for our customers. As you add bars and containers to the “Included in the Launch” section of your Launch Checklist, it will trigger the launch name to display on your Roadmap and Portfolio, reducing the need for you to have to update stakeholders on which items have planned launches and how they’re going. The information is front and center for all who need it.\nKeep reading for a quick recap of recent enhancements and capabilities to our Launch Management solution.\n1. See associated launches in the Table View for roadmaps and portfolios\nOn the table view, a new column displays associated launches. Here, your product leaders and stakeholders can easily look at all items on a roadmap or portfolio and understand which have an associated launch and which don’t. They can dig a little deeper by clicking on each Launch to find the status updates.\n2. Launch information can also be accessed in the Timeline View for roadmaps and portfolios\nThis concept extends to the timeline view for roadmaps by connecting associated launch information on hover and showcasing upcoming launches as milestone-like flags at the top of your timeline. These flags are designed a little differently to stand out but can be turned off via a toggle at the bottom of your roadmap if you need a more focused view. All of this happens when you connect a bar or container to a launch. You can now focus your time on more pressing needs.\n3. Target dates for bars and containers display within the launch checklist\nLastly, we know that coordinating launch tasks is a feat in itself. Your team must complete all the tasks in time for the launch. If you’re not involved in the day-to-day development, this may mean following up with a product manager or engineer to ensure that the item is still on track and adjusting your plans accordingly. \nBy displaying target dates for bars and containers within your launch checklist, you eliminate the status updates and follow-ups. If you have your roadmap integrated with JIRA or ADO, this may be even easier as the dates now pass through from your development tool to your roadmap items, and finally, to your launch.\nTry Launch Management today!\nLaunch Management is available as a part of our Enterprise plan and our two-week free trial.

We found that our panelists and our attendees had a variety of reasons they not only show up every day but are excited to do so.\nCheck out what other product management professionals use for their motivation. File away a few of your favorites for the next time you’d rather keep hitting the snooze button.\nWhat Motivates Product Managers to Get Out of Bed Every Morning?\nVariety\nWhen you’re working in product management, no two days are the same. With a wide range of tasks on our plate and the dynamic nature of the role, you’re never in danger of getting bored. This unpredictableness is a spark that many product managers thrive on.\nSuzanne Abate, CEO of The Development Factory, was one of the featured panelists in our happiness webinar. She cited this element of the job as her spark to start the day.\n“It’s never the same,” Abate said. “Every single day is going to be a different kind of thing because there’s going to be different tasks that you’re facing or different fires you have to put out.”\nThis sentiment was echoed by several webinar attendees. One product manager from a healthcare company, who cited “The opportunity to do something new every day.”\nA product manager in the content protection industry said, “I get excited to wake up and learn, do something new.”\nEmbracing the pandemonium\nNot only must product managers tackle a diverse array of tasks during their workday, but there’s also an element of unpredictability. You simply never know what the day will throw at you.\nFor panelist Kevin Steigerwald, Director of Product Design at Jama Software, that’s a feature, not a bug.\n“Knowing that there is going to be a little bit of chaos today, and there are going to be different problems to solve,” he said. “I have to coordinate with everyone in the organization. I’m not going into work and just talking to one person all day long.”\nAnother webinar attendee eloquently echoed this. “If you’re not drawn to crazy, then you don’t belong in product,” said a product manager for a credit rating firm.\nDownload The Essentialist Product Manager ➜\nTeamwork\nProduct management is a team sport, even if the other players aren’t technically on your “team” in the org chart. But the tasks on our plate require a ton of interaction and working together with colleagues from across the organization. Together you’ll investigate, discuss, debate, and solve problems.\nThis powers another panelist’s internal alarm clock.\n“Collaboration is a pretty key thing that I really enjoy. When you come together with everyone from the different disciplines, working with design, working with developers, with support and marketing,” said Candice Yono, Senior Product Manager at Pivotal. “I love seeing the different perspectives and the different take that everyone brings to the table and how that comes to shape some solutions that no single individual would have been able to come up with on their own.”\nSome of our attendees also found this facet of the job to be their reason for clocking in every day. A product manager for auto dealer software referenced “my core working team” as his motivation.\n“The people I work with,” said a product development manager for a guitar company. “And the pride we all share in the quality products we make.”\nInnovation\nOne of the best parts of product management is bringing new solutions to the market. It’s the perfect combination of creativity, business savvy, and execution. For some attendees, this was their catalyst for seizing the day.\nA product manager for a user research platform craves “exciting challenges to solve,” while a senior product manager for a computer-aided design firm is pumped about “changing the industry.”\n“The opportunity to create cool, new products,” said a product manager for a real estate software firm while their colleague answered, “Addressing my beta testers issues.”\nMaking a real impact was key for a security firm product manager for a security firm, who cherishes “the opportunity to have real input into effective change.”\nBut an associate product manager working on employee engagement solutions might have summed it up best, exclaiming, “watching my idea come to life!”\nDelighting customers\nA customer-centric mindset is essential for developing great, useful solutions, and thinking about their users was another commonly cited incentive.\nThe COO of a healthcare call center solutions provider mentioned: “the end value our products provide our clients.” However, the big motivator for others is addressing their customers’ key challenges.\n“Solving someone’s problem, making them enjoy their job, and making their day,” said a product owner for a process management firm.\nThe grind\nPatience is a virtue. Especially in product management, where it can take months or years to bring an idea to life and reach end-users. To keep their eyes on the prize and show up every day with a smile, some product managers lean into the routine.\nA senior business analyst for a television production and monetization firm referenced “my 7 am daily standup” as their wake-up call.\nOthers just enjoy chipping away at things a little each day. A product owner in the financial services industry mentioned “moving things forward one step,” while an industrial systems product manager said, “I want to complete something.”\n“I really enjoy what I do… with challenges and all,” said a product manager at a process automation firm. “I have still so much to learn only being a year in this position coming from QA… major change but loving it more every day.”\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nA Little Hectic, but Pretty Happy\nNo matter what particular part of the job ultimately gets people going, product managers remain a pretty happy cohort. Our 2020 product management survey found the vast majority of product managers are happy with their role. The average satisfaction rating is 3.8 out of 5. To read a little more about the current state of product management, download the 2020 product management report below.\nThere are some important drivers for that happiness—and definitely, a few things we’re not fans of—but most of us wouldn’t want to do anything else. 92% of product managers plan to stay in a similar role, and most of us just want more help and support to do the jobs we have.\nDownload the Free Product Leadership Book\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-managers-motivation/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925724618,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Top 5 Best Product Management Websites of 2022","text":"\n So many websites and so little time. And while that truism could be applied equally to recipes, sports analysis, or politics, we’re focusing here on product management websites. It turns out a lot of product folks like to share their tips and wisdom on the Internet.\nHere at ProductPlan, we can’t get enough of product-related content, so we’re always on the lookout for who’s doling out easily-digestible-yet-professionally-fulfilling insights. That’s why we can save you the Googling and share our top five product management websites from 2022, along with why they topped our year-end list.\n5. Product Talk\nThere’s no one more immersed in applying discovery and customer insights to prioritization and planning than Product Talk’s Teresa Torres. She literally wrote the book on it!\nBut this author didn’t stop there and continues pumping out quality content, all focused on gathering great customer and market intelligence along with best practices to put it best to use. Real-world stories from the trenches at companies like trivago and CarMax share a stage with meaty posts on how to stop salespeople from blocking your access to customers and using opportunity decision trees to visualize discovery work for easier consumption.\nThere’s even content on how to land your first product job, what to do when your buyers aren’t your users, and implementing continuous discovery at startups. And if you prefer to watch versus read, there are excellent videos on topics including collaborative decision-making and showing your work to attain stakeholder buy-in.

Silicon Valley Product Group\nThe Silicon Valley Product Group isn’t just a bunch of product peeps that happen to have a 415 area code. The SVPG remains at the forefront of thought leadership in product development.\nFounded by Marty Cagan, who cut his product leadership teeth at places like eBay, Netscape, and Hewlett-Packard, the SVPG has been sharing best practices and practical insights into product development for more than two decades. That means there’s a massive back-catalog of meaty posts on agile, waterfall, and the age-old dilemma of where product management should live, and the hits keep on coming 20+ years later.\nRecent entries include articles on coaching vs. mentoring, product/market fit, and what product managers need to take off their plates so they can focus on interacting directly with customers and engineers. But a quick search on nearly any topic should uncover a gem or two from their list of published posts.\n3. Department of Product\nThis company’s bread and butter is training product managers, but their blog doles out a ton of useful content for anyone interested in the field. For PMs lacking technical backgrounds or who are decades past their days writing code, explainers on buzzy topics, including Web3, GitHub, and natural language processing are unintimidating primers on subjects you need to be conversant in to hold your own with developers.\nPosts on process—such as writing release notes and managing UX debt—show they’re not afraid to spend time on the less-sexy parts of the job, while content regarding SaaS pricing and measuring product-market fit helps product managers optimize their go-to-market tactics. There’s also plenty of career advice, including pointers on how to build useful skills, including reading API documentation, SQL, and even how to draw on a whiteboard with confidence.\nAnd, if your eyes are tired after all that close reading, pop in your earbuds and check out one of their podcasts, where they interview product leaders from companies including Wayfair, Venmo, and Uber.\n2. Sachin Rekhi\nNotejoy founder and CEO Sachin Rekhi’s website provides a flavorful variety of hundreds of essays and videos spanning a cornucopia of product-related topics.\nVideos on career-propelling topics such as mastering influencing without authority and getting actionable product feedback stand alongside posts on midlife career exploration, finding product culture fit, implementing OKRs, and the importance of leaders reviewing which metrics you’re using\nSachin also frequently re-reads some once-hot business books and gives a fresh take on them with a bit of 20/20 hindsight, including Peter Thiel’s Zero to One and Hamilton Heller’s 7 Powers, as well as more recent reads such as the behind-the-scenes look into Amazon’s working backward approach to product development and where you begin with the press release and Andrew Chen’s The Cold Start Problem.\n1. Bring the Donuts\nKen Norton’s Bring the Donuts is sadly not the latest subscription box or instant delivery service for baked goodies, but it is our top website of 2022. What—other than its unforgettable moniker—makes it stand out from the crowd?\nKen’s a former Google product leader and his posts are so thorough they even have footnotes. He challenges product managers to think beyond the immediate and consider nontraditional topics such as thirty-year product plans and why companies should offer dual career tracks for product management. But he also digs into some fundamentals, including creating strong product cultures and figuring out the ideal PM-to-engineer ratio.\nThere are also “deep dives” into how products get built at leading companies such as Stripe, Slack, and Airbnb, giving product leaders behind-the-scenes peeks into how those firms roll out innovative new offerings.\nDownload the Career Guide for Product Managers ➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-mangement-websites/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925780117,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"What Does a Lead Engineer at ProductPlan Do in a Day?","text":"\n I’m writing for the first time on the ProductPlan blog! Long-time reader, first-time writer. I’m currently a remote Lead Software Engineer at ProductPlan, where I head up a team of four engineers focused on bringing you List View, among other things.\nOur team is distributed throughout the United States and Central America, making my workday out of San Luis Obispo, CA unique from our in-house colleagues.\nI’ve been a part of ProductPlan for over a year now and am excited about how we’ve approached remote team-building. My time here has been unlike anywhere else, which is rooted in the focus on communication, alignment around projects, and the transparency from our leadership team.\nA Day in the Life of a Lead Engineer at ProductPlan\nWorking here is pretty special. So, what does a Lead Engineer at ProductPlan do in a day?\nHere’s a look into my Thursday.\nMorning activities\n8:00 am:\nThe alarm goes off and I immediately hit snooze. Half of my team members are a time zone ahead, so they’re already up and working off our team’s backlog before the other half arrives.\n8:15 am:\nSnooze again. Luckily, my commute is right around the corner.\n8:30 am:\nRise and shine. Now, my baby is awake! I get this time in the morning to bond with him while I make a cup of coffee before my wife takes over.\n9:00 am:\nI’m sitting at my desk. Crack my knuckles, and the workday begins. We use Slack at ProductPlan. I add the :coffee: emoji to our Slack’s #development channel. Our entire development team does the same. We find this to be an easy way to indicate when we’re all available, especially with overlapping time zones.\nNext, I go into my personal Trello and organize my to-do list for the day.\n9:15 am:\nTime for our team stand up. Here’s where I attempt to make a joke in the morning, it’s challenging with the caffeine just barely sinking in. But our team is benevolent, and I get a few chuckles. Our stand-ups are timeboxed to 15 mins.\nDownload Ship It: The Agile Product Manager's Guide to Products ➜\n9:30 am:\nAt this point, we’re all logging into Zoom for our All Team Retro. It’s an opportunity to give shoutouts, explain what went well, and learn what didn’t go well to better pinpoint what we could improve on as an engineering team.\nAt ProductPlan, I’ve come to appreciate how much we embrace being “judgment-free.” This enables us to spend time reviewing the wins and losses as an entire engineering team. We’re not a huge team, so we still make the time to do this.\nWe always try to derive some action items from this meeting. Then it rolls into Part 2 of the meeting with the same attendees.\n10:00 am:\nThe next part of our All Team meeting is All Team Planning. Myself and other team leads demo what was just released. I like to use this time to “eat our own dog food” and showcase new features we built within ProductPlan. For instance, I use List View to effectively show what we have in store for the coming sprint.\nI like to use the Sprint style because I can see our sprint start and end dates. I use Legends to differentiate our Sprint Goals vs. our Stretch Goals—this is nice to have and use as a reference to review past sprints.\nHere’s what it looks like:\nYesterday, I used this same view to pitch what we’re planning to product and engineering stakeholders. I synced up with our Director of Product Management (Annie) and SVP of Engineering (Mark) to agree on which projects align with the business goals for the given sprint.\nOnce they share their feedback, I guide my team with Mark and Annie’s input from our earlier conversation. I love to emphasize that my team helps create the pitch, which goes a long way in building motivation.\nIn today’s meeting, I am presenting my team’s upcoming sprint to the other engineering teams. I value this time when all the engineering teams come together and have the ear of our CEO (Brad), Annie, and Mark.\nWe do a great job of having one single source of truth, and that’s ProductPlan. We’re not scattered between a Google Doc here and a Powerpoint there. My team can see this, and my boss can see the plans at any time.\nThen I sit back and listen to the other engineering teams present their plans.\n10:30:\nTime for headphones and VSCode. Today is a high context switching day, so let’s pick up a low-hanging fruit item.\n11:30 am:\nTime for more coffee. One cool thing that we do to forge relationships with the team are virtual coffee breaks. These are especially important since we don’t have the opportunity to chat over a water cooler in a remote setting.\nOnce a month, we are randomly paired with another co-worker for 15 minutes (but often the conversation rolls into overtime) and given a prompt question if we need it. It’s a great way to learn about other departments and build your network.\n12:00 pm:\nIt’s lunchtime! I grab a bite with the baby before he takes his afternoon nap. I play with our dogs and try to get out and get some fresh air.\nAfternoon activities\n1:00 pm:\nOnce I’m back from lunch, I hold a Project Kickoff with the team. In the background, my dog is barking at the mailman like clockwork.\nWith every Project Kickoff, I like to start with “Why?” and “What is the problem we are trying to solve?” I’ll leverage our customer feedback board in Trello to pull customer quotes that reinforce the customers’ voice and put them first when trying to solve the problem.\nThe better I can convey this message to the team; the more successful the project will be.\n3:00 pm:\nProductPlan’s most recent Book Club has been going on for a few weeks. We meet once a week to discuss the chapter we read and answer the questions seeded beforehand. It’s a fun way to collaborate with people outside my team and talk about things that aren’t necessarily tied to the product.\nWe’re currently reading Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High. If you haven’t read this book yet, I highly recommend it!\nCoffee Breaks and Book Club are just some of the great remote team bonding experiences at ProductPlan. I also get a kick out of some running Slack channels like #pets, #parents, and #battlestations.\n4:00 pm:\nHeadphones back on! I set my Slack status to “In the zone” to indicate to my teammates that I may not respond to any messages for a bit. Let’s close this pull request from earlier!\n6:00 pm:\nWhat a day. Before I wrap, I like to post an end-of-day status in Slack. This consists of what I did for the day and any requests for code that needs to be reviewed or tested. The rest of the team does this as well, which helps us easily resume in the morning when we’re spread out across different time zones.\nTime to start making dinner and enjoy the rest of the night with my family!\nTakeaways\nThe days where we are not planning out the next sprint benefit from being more focused. We strive to have as much asynchronous communication as possible and minimize meetings so our engineers can get into the zone.\nAt ProductPlan, every engineer has a say in how we should go about solving a customer problem. I find that being close to determining the solution is highly motivating for everyone involved. We index on team-building opportunities since remote life can be challenging and encourage people to step away to prevent burnout. We’re all here to support one another and help each other out, this is an example of one of those days.

I understand how much thought (and possibly anxiety) goes into these roadmap presentations.\nThey’re the culmination of months of work, customer conversations, and experience. There’s no need to be afraid of your roadmap, either. They’re the capstone for a product manager’s vision and strategy. I want to share my thoughts from being on both sides of the process. I hope it gives you some inspiration to help you present executive roadmaps that align, guide, and facilitate the right conversations. And of course, to help you deliver a better product to your customers.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nMistakes I’ve Seen When Presenting Executive Roadmaps\nThe most common mistake product managers make in the roadmapping process is assuming they know exactly what to build without building consensus first. Of course, you are the customer expert, but leading with the assumption that you alone know the ideal priorities has consequences that might sabotage your well-intended agenda.\nThe best way to overcome this is through curiosity and communication. Have informal discussions with executives and other stakeholders before the executive planning meeting. That way, you’ll present a roadmap with the right priorities and align those to the company’s business goals. It will help you to have a seamless review and approval process.\nAnother key mistake: over-optimism. Believing your team can deliver more done than is realistic sets everyone up for disappointment in future planning meetings. If you must create a roadmap with delivery dates, try to keep broad timeframes such as quarterly. Things are always more complicated and take longer than you and your team think, right? It will help your cause if you educate executives over time to know that you can only estimate fuzzy delivery dates and that priorities will certainly shift.\nHow to Present Your Executive Roadmap\nDelivering a winning roadmap presentation to the executive team isn’t just about the hour or so you get in the conference room. It takes a combination of preparation, execution, and follow-up to get your plans blessed and leave a room of satisfied and confident stakeholders in your wake.\nWhat to do before the roadmap presentation\nWith so much focus on the roadmap itself, many people overlook one of the fundamental secrets to success: laying the groundwork for when you present your executive roadmap.\nThe goal of a roadmap presentation isn’t to wow the audience of stakeholders. You’re not trying to knock them off your feet with bold new ideas and surprises. In fact, if stakeholders are seeing things for the first time during your presentation, you’re setting yourself up for failure and frustration instead of praise. A big reveal during a roadmap presentation puts everyone on the defensive and opens yourself up for a debate of whether it’s the right thing to build\nAlternatively, prepare everyone in advance for what they’re going to see. Build enough support and consensus that the presentation itself is an official sign-off opportunity.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nContinuous communication and conversation\nRemove the element of surprise and set the stage for broad acceptance and support by maintaining a dialogue with each stakeholder in advance of the presentation. You want each person to be familiar and comfortable with each item on the roadmap. Schedule time with each stakeholder at least a couple of weeks in advance.\nYou can most effectively get alignment by linking each item back to the overarching business goals guiding the prioritization and roadmapping process. Don’t tell people that something’s essential—explain why it’s crucial – why it will add customer value or delight customers in some way. Then justify its priority and a rough timeline.\nMoreover, remember that these should be two-way conversations. The aim is to solicit feedback from your stakeholders at this stage. Again, curiosity goes a long way. Give them enough time to solicit feedback from their own organizations.\nWhile you may not agree with everything you hear, you’ll have the opportunity to incorporate their suggestions when warranted. Ideally, any dissent or open issues are dealt with and resolved well before everyone gathers together for the actual presentation.\nSet the agenda\nThe objective of an executive roadmap presentation is to get their approval. Your agenda should reflect that. Provide enough context about the strategic goals to set things up and then efficiently communicate the elements of the roadmap itself. Address any outstanding issues or questions that require the entirety of the executive team to settle. Finally, get a solid green light to move forward (or particular action items if they’re not yet ready to provide that).\nYour slides or visual aids should move the conversation along accordingly, with a firm eye on the clock as you go. You only have so much time with the entire group assembled, so stick with the important topics and table everything else.\nScope it out\nA quick way to reduce your credibility is to predict specific ship dates. As a product manager, you’re only one input into the development effort. You and your engineering team may also be unaware of dependencies that can impact a schedule.\nDo your homework, huddle up with tech leads, and develop rough estimates for each initiative (and have an idea of the minimal version for each one). Preparing this information will prevent you from overpromising and under-delivering. Plus, it’s helpful when you’re prioritizing. It might also come in handy during preliminary conversations with executives (or during the meeting itself) if there’s a request to reshuffle some things.\nDuring the Roadmap Presentation\nThe main event is all about meeting executives wherever they are. They are not obsessing over your product roadmap. They’re trying to figure out how to achieve the business goals and want to see how your roadmap helps get them there. Show them.\nKeeping the strategic goals top-of-mind helps create and deliver a productive and successful roadmap presentation. Stakeholders want to walk away confident in the path you’ve plotted and excited to see your plans come to fruition.\nThe power of a visual\nUsing graphics and pictures to connect the roadmap to the rationale behind it is helpful. It ties the initiatives in the roadmap to actual customer value, business goals, and meeting real needs.\nBig picture thinking\nExecutives have a lot on their plates and generally, try to stay as high level as possible. While you might want to take a deeper dive into the platform details with the CTO or the new messaging opportunities with the head of marketing, this isn’t the forum for those interactions.\nThose more specific conversations can take place before or after the presentation itself. This meeting is all about consensus, buying in, and signing off. Sticking to the big picture avoids thorny topics or detours that might lose the audience or make them question if the plan is fully baked.\nLevels of certainty\nProduct managers aren’t psychics, so every roadmap item sits somewhere on the spectrum between “definitely going to happen” and “definitely a possibility.” However, without the proper context, executives will view everything on there as equals when it comes to delivery expectations. Unfortunately, people hear what they want to hear.\nDon’t be afraid to acknowledge that there are unknowns. Communicate your level of certainty for each initiative during the presentation.\nThere are two dimensions to this. The first is more prominent, in that the further out you go, the less certain things are for everyone. You can mitigate this by creating roadmaps that don’t extend as far into the future. However, beyond that, there may be uncertainties driven by things other than the calendar.\nThere may be unknowns lurking, such as dependencies, regulatory issues, expected new technologies, or customer commitments. If these could impact the roadmap and leave you less certain about some items, be sure to call that out. Product managers will often color code or identify roadmap initiatives based on how positive they are that it will all fall into place.\nTie everything to business goals\nThis audience cares about top-line business goals. While they may not embrace a “by any means necessary” mentality, they also don’t have time to worry about all the details.\nTherefore the context of the entire conversation should be about the KPIs they care about and how the roadmap moves the needle in the right direction. For example, how does a particular feature accelerate growth or decrease churn? How does a roadmap initiative influence progress on a strategic objective?\nYour presentation should both ask and answer those sorts of questions, as that’s what interests executives. Everything else is a detail.\nDownload Feature-less Roadmaps: Unlock Your Product's Strategic Potential➜\nThere will be questions\nIf you’ve done an excellent job beforehand, your presentation shouldn’t have a bunch of “gotcha” questions. You’ll already know the hot button issues before the meeting and will have addressed them in previous discussions or during the meat of the presentation.\nYou, of course, should be asking consensus-building questions during the meeting. And you will likely hear a few different types of questions from executives:\nClarifications and deeper dives. An executive may want to drill down on a particular element of the presentation. It’s OK to answer, but if it’s going to derail the momentum offer to meet with them later to discuss things in detail.\nA direct challenge. Maybe you didn’t quite have the consensus you thought you did, or perhaps you had a holdout you were hoping would be won over by the crowd. Ask questions to uncover the real concern. Don’t be afraid to let an ally on the executive team chime in with their support.\nAn impromptu change request. Despite all your preparatory work, an executive may decide the roadmap review is the time to ask for something to be added, dropped, or swapped. It might be totally valid and based on new information, or it could be a bright shiny object that will fade under a more in-depth examination. In the end, it’s possibly a good idea, but it’s your job to educate them that there are other higher priorities.\nAfter the Presentation\nFollow up and follow-through\nChances are you walked away with some sort of to-do list. It could be sharing the roadmap with other parties, further research, providing more data, or clarifying something.\nDon’t let those open issues fester; get on them as quickly as possible so they can be closed out. Closing the loop, maintains momentum and shows you’re responsive and were paying attention.\nYou can also formalize any final decisions by sending out a follow-up email outlining what was decided and the expected next steps. For executives, this is the “speak now or forever hold your peace” opportunity as they realize this roadmap is now ready for execution.\nChanges to roadmap priorities are inevitable. Alert the executive team when these changes happen as part of your job. Also, if any of those disruptions require executive input, don’t put things off any longer than necessary. You don’t want to have that hanging over your head for the next meeting.\nFinally, if it turns out some of the business goals that drove the prioritization and roadmap planning have evolved, be sure to re-engage with the executive team and grapple with their impact. Don’t assume you should stick with the existing plan.\nProduct management is hard. But presenting your roadmap to executives is your opportunity to shine and show why you were hired in the first place.\nLearn how to build an executive-facing roadmap with these 8 tips.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/presenting-executive-roadmaps/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925725791,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"What are the benefits of having your launch plan in the same tool as your roadmap?","text":"\n As a product marketer, I’ve run a good number of launches throughout my career. Product launches. Feature launches. Some were quite big, requiring a tidal wave of activity that spanned departments. Others were small, perhaps only involving an entry in the biweekly release notes.\nRegardless of size and scope, launches always turn out better when you involve the product team. It should be a given, considering that what you’re launching is a direct result of the research, prioritization, and planning the product team did months prior. So much of the knowledge you need to launch a product—whether you’re a salesperson, a customer success rep, or a product marketer—is in the minds of the product team.\nBut time and time again, we hear from product teams that they don’t have great visibility into what happens during a launch. Many, in fact, describe a siloed approach to launching products. Product teams may be responsible for the planning and development of the product.\nBut the launch of it? That’s someone else’s job.\nThis was one of the significant challenges we set out to solve when we built our new go-to-market tool within ProductPlan, Launch Management. We wanted to create a single space to plan your launch, where the product strategy could flow from roadmap to execution. We also wanted to give product people complete visibility into all the activities required to launch a new product or feature.\nSo that begs the question. What are the benefits of having your launch plan in the same tool as your roadmap? Read on to find out.\nLearn how to transform your product launches from chaos to success➜\nFor those managing the launch, visibility creates the opportunity for better strategy and launch quality.\nTry searching for product launch software, and you’ll likely come across several project management tools with launch templates. These tools are effective for managing the launch of a new product. However, the product team often doesn’t own or operate them.\nThis creates a scenario where the product team works in one tool, and the go-to-market team responsible for the launch works in another.\nWhen this happens, it’s difficult for the product team to maintain visibility into the development of product messaging, creating marketing materials, implementing customer support initiatives, and so forth.\nYou can partially solve this by juggling licenses and getting your product team to work out of both. But in an era of work defined by tool proliferation and the increasing cost of the Enterprise tech stack, that can be expensive to maintain and cumbersome to use.\nYour launch plan should be in the same tool as your roadmap. It gives the product team a clear view into critical launch activities, allowing them to ensure each demonstrates an understanding of what the product is designed to achieve and for who. It also helps product understand the timing of key communication events to inform their expectations for product awareness and adoption.\nAnd finally, it helps product feel assured that every deliverable has an owner. Every piece of the launch has been accounted for, is planned, and is ready to be executed.\nFor those supporting the launch, it encourages roadmap readership.\nHaving your launch plan in the same platform your product team spends their time ensures a cohesive strategy, from plan to launch. But it also plays a critical role in establishing shared ownership of the launch and the entire product strategy.\nFor the marketing folks planning campaigns, the salespeople writing emails, and the customer success reps working with customers, the roadmap needs to be available. If your roadmap has been built well, it contains the context your go-to-market teams need to execute.\n“Who is this product for? Why did we build it? What goals will it help our business achieve?”\nAnswers to questions these questions are found in the roadmap. And they can guide the development of your launch plan.\nAs a product marketer, I’ll be the first to admit I don’t always read our product roadmap. But I know I can find the information I need for my launch plan in the roadmap.\nThis accessibility encourages viewership of the roadmap in a context that makes the information contained within the roadmap actionable. For instance, if you’re writing product taglines, you can use the roadmap to view supporting documentation.\nOverall, a product launch should never take place in a vacuum. It should be a natural extension of the product strategy and serve as the execution of the product roadmap. Each launch is your opportunity to measure outcomes. And to determine whether you achieve the goals associated with the overall product strategy and vision.\nWith that being the case, it makes sense that the launch plan should live alongside the roadmap.

Building the product was hard: it was taking longer to develop than everyone expected (of course). The complexity of what we were trying to accomplish became more evident as each day passed.\nThe product backlog I managed grew daily. I heard requests from customers, domain experts, consultants, our development team, and internal stakeholders. And I diligently added the stories to the backlog. Feature request? Add it to the backlog. Bug found? Add it to the backlog. Corner case we needed to handle one day? Backlog.\nDeclaring Backlog Bankruptcy\nI diligently prioritized and managed the epics and stories, moving them into the next two or three sprints in the sprint backlog. As the months passed, it became clear there was no way we’d be able to develop what was in the product backlog over the next few months. There was rising frustration from the whole team at the pace of development, partly from the perception that we would never get to everything.\nAnd every day, my stress grew as the backlog ballooned.\nWhat was the point of diligently managing the backlog when it would be impossible to accomplish it all? Especially when everything a few months in the future would likely be different?\nSo along with the CTO, I made a decision – we’d declare backlog bankruptcy.\nEvery story, issue, bug, and idea that we weren’t planning to release in a near-term sprint, I would delete. Clicking Delete was one of the harder things I’ve done. Over 600 items… gone.\nBut then something interesting happened. There were no repercussions from that decision. And I got a sense of relief after eliminating the cognitive overhead created by the backlog. And after ruthlessly prioritizing and limiting what we added to the backlog, we got the product to market faster. Starting from scratch felt GOOD.\nThe lesson declaring backlog bankruptcy taught me was that if an idea has high enough value for customers, it will come back. It will bubble up to the top. I no longer keep massive lists of all the ideas and things I want to do in the future. Sometimes the simplicity this creates in your product is a positive experience for customers.\nIt also taught me more about the purpose of the product backlog – it’s not a place for every future opportunity. We needed to have a process around what gets added to the backlog.\nDownload the free Backlog Refinement: How to Prioritize What Matters Book➜\nWhat Does a Healthy Backlog Look Like?\nEvery organization doing agile software development does it a little bit differently. My approach isn’t for everyone, especially for organizations that need to have more certainty about their product roadmap more than a few months out.\nFor me, I’ve been a part of startups using only some variant of scrum. We plan the stories a few sprints ahead, guided by the epics and themes on the product roadmap. That’s typically enough for any product manager. Ideally, there aren’t hundreds of stories in the backlog.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Kit ➜\nWhen the product backlog is too long, it clouds the vision and creates underlying stress of what’s not getting done. A shorter backlog frees you up to think about what’s most important. It improves creativity. Think in timeframes of perhaps three to six months out.\nThink about your process for what gets added to the backlog. It’s not for every possible “future” idea that you haven’t necessarily committed to. Yet you still likely want to track ideas and inspiration you’re getting from customer interviews. And you might want to remember who asked you for a particular feature so that you have context. For those situations, I recommend creating a separate “future opportunity” list, so you have a place to add your learnings as you proceed with customer discovery on the idea.\nAfter having been involved in launching multiple products over the years it’s clear to me that things you think are super important today aren’t as pressing a few months from now. So by adding every idea to the backlog, you’re doing yourself a disservice.\nBut the stories and epics that you believe will add lots of customer value in the short term go for it. Also, it’s good practice to include bugs, tracking them and peppering them into near term sprints.\nDownload the Agile Product Manager's Guide to Building Better Products ➜\nWarning Signs Your Backlog is Unhealthy\nAs a product manager, how do you know you’ve entered the dangerous territory with your backlog? Here are some of the things I’ve found to watch out for:\nYour backlog has become a dumping ground for every random idea from every stakeholder. Sure, it feels good to be able to tell a vital stakeholder you’ve “noted” their opinion, but is the minuscule, incremental cognitive overhead worth it if you do that 100 or 1,000 times?\nYou’re adding ideas that you’d like to implement “someday.” This thinking is long-term, and because everything is guaranteed to change from a product, customer, and competitive standpoint, what’s the point? I suggest deleting anything in your backlog that is older than six months.\nYou’re spending hours every month prioritizing items that aren’t winding up in your short-term sprint backlog. Be thinking every day about what will provide customer value in the short term.\nSometimes You Need to Add More\nNow, to be clear, there are many situations where you might want to add something to the backlog even if it’s not going into a near-term sprint. For example, if your CEO believes a feature has merit, and you want to validate the idea and at the same time let them know you’ve noted it in the product backlog.\nIf you absolutely must keep a long product backlog because it’s necessary from a corporate or process standpoint, try organizing it or grouping it by a theme, such as “near term” and “long term.” That might help a little bit with your sanity.\nAs I mentioned previously, you don’t need to track everything that goes into your product backlog. You can use a separate “opportunity” or idea backlog, such as the Table Layout in ProductPlan. This approach is a great way to capture ideas that you haven’t committed to, and that need further validation.\nMy decision many years ago to declare backlog bankruptcy has yielded so many lessons for me since then. By the way, out of extra caution, before I clicked Delete, I exported my product backlog. And I never went back to look at it.\nWant to learn how to efficiently funnel backlog items onto the product roadmap?Read Your Guide to Product Roadmaps\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/backlog-bankruptcy/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925791702,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Why Distributed Product Teams are Here to Stay","text":"\n There is no going back to “normal” for product teams. The idea of simply translating what we did in the office can’t be matched in our distributed world.\nAt a minimum, I believe we need to start thinking remote-first. While we will eventually head back to our offices, we want to prepare ourselves to do it better next time. Even better is to embrace it going forward, perhaps with office/remote hybrids that take advantage of the benefits of both worlds. Like many of you I’m missing the social side of the office, yet cherish the productivity and focus time I’m getting while working from my home.\nEven before the pandemic there was a shift happening towards distributed product development teams. Especially for software companies that had the luxury of hiring employees wherever they lived. Covid-19 has accelerated this process and, in my opinion, distributed teams will become the new norm.\nThere have always been the remote work success stories such as Invision and Basecamp who have entirely distributed teams – and made it work. Most tech companies dabbled in remote workers, yet it was often the exception to the “normal” onsite work policy.\nProductPlan was somewhere in between. Much of our engineering team was already distributed throughout the US, because we made the decision early on to hire the most talented employees regardless of where they lived. Often these were people we worked with in former roles, so we knew their remote work ethic and knew their approach fit in our growing company and our culture.\nDownload Jim Semick's Book: \"The Essentialist Product Manager\" ➜\nOur company values infuse our beliefs about “balance” in our lives, “transparency” in our communications, and other attributes that lend themselves to a distributed work culture. And over the past few years we had fully embraced the tools and communication practices that make distributed work, well, work. We were already good at it.\nAnd personally, I was already predisposed to remote work. For years I’ve been living a semi-remote work life, and have advocated its benefits. Twenty years ago when I was a technical book author for Microsoft I would spend my days drinking coffee in bed with my laptop, eventually moving to the coffee shop. Clearly, I love coffee.\nI was an early remote worker and believed then (and now) that it’s possible to have an ideal combination of work/life/tech balance and be productive while having a hand in building products I was incredibly proud of.\nLike many of you, we transitioned to fully distributed one day in March. We finished “shifting” to remote work in a matter of minutes. Or so I thought.\nOver the past two months, I’ve come to realize that we don’t want to simply replicate what we previously had.\nThe New Norm is Different\nI’ve realized that the idea of us waiting for the eventual day when we can return to the prior way of doing things was actually not the goal.\nAt ProductPlan we’ve decided to fully embrace remote work—to be even better than before. Sure, many of us will eventually head back into the office (after all, we have space in a fun location near the beach). But in the meantime, let’s shift the way we think about distributed work altogether, and get really good at it.\nI’ve been reading and listening a lot about the future of work, and while this shift has been happening for a while, with Covid-19, that shift has accelerated even faster.\nDownload From Product Manager to Product Leader ➜\nRecently, I listened to a podcast by Sam Harris interviewing Matt Mullenweg, the founder of WordPress, about the evolution of distributed work. Matt’s company, Automattic, is entirely distributed—with almost 1,200 employees.\nIn the interview, Mullenweg talks about how we don’t want to replicate what we’re doing today in offices, but rather about how we can take distributed work to the next level. This next-level creates even more productivity and better decisions than before.\nThese ideas have me realizing that there are so many more best practices we can incorporate into our distributed work culture that can help us build a better product. We no longer need to hold meetings in 60-minute chunks. Or perhaps we can create a culture of combined in-person and distributed brainstorming that gives the best of both worlds.\nIn his follow-up article on Distributed Works’ Five Levels of Autonomy, Mullenweg discusses how so many companies (or at least knowledge workers) today are working remotely, yet not fully embracing remote work. They’re still waiting for the day they can head back to the office, and still have the same mindset that decisions need to be made in person for example.\nIf we can hire people anywhere in the world, in any country, we need to be willing to adapt processes for asynchronous decisions by people in different timezones. They no longer should need to adapt to the timezone and schedules for the people back at “headquarters.” (Is there such a thing as “headquarters” any more?) For example, we can use tools like Slack and email more effectively, support home offices for employees, limiting synchronous meetings (and having clear agendas when we do have scheduled meetings).\nIn the different levels of distributed work autonomy, Mullenweg makes a great point that at the highest levels, fully distributed product teams and even companies can work asynchronously and in “nirvana” actually perform better than any in-person organization.\nOur paradigm is truly shifting at this moment if more companies are aspiring to this level of asynchronous work.\nDistributed Product Teams\nThe shift to distributed work means we need to trust more. It means that creativity and written communication skills become even more important. At Mullenweg’s company Automattic they sometimes “interview” people exclusively via email for some roles – after all, if the written word is one of the most essential skills, why not shift the interview to that.\nAnnie Dunham, our Director of Product at ProductPlan believes that as product teams move to remote work, we need to be intentional about the culture. “Rather than defaulting to a command and control structure, think about how you build a foundation as a team,” she says. “On the engineering side, we speak frequently about our ceremonies and standups and what is the best way for us to get value out of them. It’s not process for the sake of process.”\nIn this new way of distributed work, I believe that writing, creative problem solving, and overall communication skills will be more valuable than ever. So will autonomy, time management, and following through on plans. The findings in ProductPlan’s 2020 Product Management Report show that communication skills are the most important skills for success.\nI’m waking up to the idea that we can be an even more productive, creative team that is distributed. Teams that have a great combination of life balance and collaboration with their customers and teams. This has the potential of fostering happier employees who are inspired by the work they’re doing and the products they’re building.\nI’m not saying that a shift to distributed work will happen overnight, or that it’s even ideal for all organizations. I understand that many employees’ lives aren’t set up for remote work — especially in this current time of homeschooling, social distancing, and economic uncertainty. However, many product teams, especially those working on digital products, are in an ideal position to take advantage of these benefits.\nAs the pandemic restrictions ease and as employees feel more comfortable, we’ll experiment with hybrid distributed/in-office configurations, perhaps complementing the remote work with in-person creativity sessions. We’ll certainly be using our office space differently. We’re also frequently sharing best practices and discussing how to do distributed work even better.\nDistributed product teams will take work and a mindset shift to be successful.

Additionally, we’ll explore ways to move the needle toward greater inclusivity and, ultimately, better business outcomes. \nWhere are the Women in Product?\nToday’s data indicates we have plenty of room for improvement if our sights are set on greater inclusivity. In the tech industry, men outnumber women, and in technical roles especially. In product management, men outnumber women almost 2:1. \nTwo key findings stood out to us in our 2021 report: men hold 65% of senior roles and, on average, earn 7% more than women in product management. \nLet’s walk through the report’s data to understand better what the current product management landscape looks like in terms of gender inequality. \nCurrently, the product management space is predominantly held by 60% men, 37% women, along with 3% that either prefers not to disclose or identify as non-binary. \nDownload a Day in a Product Manager's Life➜\nThis isn’t what the numbers showed just two decades ago when greater gender diversity in product management. Deborah Liu, VP of Product at Facebook, explains: \n“In the early to mid-2000s, Product Management at tech companies had almost the same number of men and women. So they came up with the solution to filter down to technical PMs, [with] the requirement that they have a degree in computer science—or a related field like electrical engineering. Unfortunately, in 2005, women only earned about one in five CS degrees in the US, which continues today. I believe that the new technical requirement changed the pool of potential PMs to one which was heavily male-dominated and thus unintentionally led to the industry moving away from gender-balanced teams.”\nWomen in Senior Management\nThe impact of the years with fewer women in product, plus the higher churn of women in this role, is finding its way into senior leadership. Just 36% of senior product roles are held by women, compared to 64% held by men. \nTo compound matters further, churn in tech is much higher for women. According to a Harvard Business School study, 41% of women leave a decade after starting in tech, compared to 17% of men. \nOf course, the global pandemic didn’t do women in the workforce any favors. On the contrary, it “set women’s labor force participation back more than 30 years.” As a result, nearly 3 million women dropped out of the workforce in 2020.\nOn the subject of gender inequality in senior management, Martin Eriksson, co-founder, and chairman of Mind the Product, writes: \n“A University of Maryland study looking at 15 years of data from the S&P1500 found that female representation in senior management brought informational and social diversity benefits, enriched the behaviors exhibited by managers throughout the firm, and motivated women in middle management. All of which resulted in improved individual and company performance – especially where the firm’s strategy was focused on innovation, in which context the informational and social benefits of gender diversity and the behaviors of more diverse teams had a bigger impact.”\nSalary Earnings for Women in Product\nInclusion and innovation may go hand in hand, but women are still earning less than their male counterparts in nearly all occupations.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women’s annual earnings were 82.3% of men’s earnings in 2020. The salary gap is even wider for women of color. \nSalary discrepancies between men and women tend to vary by the number of years of experience. However, overall, men make 7% more than women in product management. While there is certainly work to do, women in product management (and technology in general) have made strides in recent years to reduce this gap.\nThat being said, men, on average, earn a higher salary (based on years of experience) at every level than their female counterparts. \n7% more for 0-2 years\n2% more 3-5 years. \n3% more 6-10 years\n9% less 11-15\nless than 1% more than 15 years\nNot surprisingly, advanced degrees play a role in commanding a higher salary. In addition, data shows that men in product tend to have more advanced degrees than women. \nImposter Syndrome and Career Goals\nOur report also found that women in product are 14% more likely to frequently or consistently feel imposter syndrome in their careers than men. For the lucky few that only rarely or never feel it, 19% were women, and 26% were men. Additionally, women are more likely to feel neutral or unhappy about their work compared to men.\nNearly half of product people say their 10-year career goals are to become a product leader. According to our report, both women and men see product leadership in their future. However, many women are looking at product leadership for more years of their careers. After a while, mens’ goals shift toward starting their own company—the second most voted category.\nThat’s a current snapshot of the state of gender inequality in product management. So how do we move the needle towards greater inclusivity?\nRead what women bring to product management.\nInclusivity is the Future\nThe need for greater inclusion was never more top-of-mind for many product teams than in 2020. \nStudies show that gender diversity in teams produces better results. Inclusion helps us perform better. Groups of diverse problem solvers outperform groups that share everyday experiences, backgrounds, and identities. \nPut, more voices, experience, and perspectives in product development translate to better products out in the world. Therefore, prioritizing inclusivity is the way forward. \nIn “Why Diversity Isn’t Just Right, but Smart,” Eriksson asserts:\n“A good product team needs a mix of design, tech, and business, a mix of genders and backgrounds, a mix of industry experience and product management experience, and a mix of skills from the visionary to the detail-oriented, from the data-hungry to the user research fanatics. This level of diversity is not just the best chance you have of representing your audience, but also ensures you’re always bringing the best experience to bear on any product challenge you face.”\nBenefits of Gender Diversity Across the Organization\nGender diversity is linked to greater profitability and better customer experiences. It also helps companies attract and retain talented people. \nMina Radhakrishnan, the co-founder of Different and 1st Head of Product at Uber, believes that:\n“The more identities, backgrounds, and experiences represented by founders and product managers, the more problems solved, the more user perspectives understood, and the more products launched by teams who have a handle on how the world will receive them.”\nAccording to the Diversity Council of Australia, people who work in inclusive teams are:\n10x more likely to be highly effective\n9x more likely to innovate\n5x more likely to provide excellent customer service\n19x more likely to be very satisfied in their jobs\n4x more likely to remain with their current companies\n2x more likely to receive regular career development opportunities\nYet despite these compelling correlations between gender diversity and better business outcomes, gender representation only increased by 2% between 2015 and 2018.\nWant to improve your sphere of inclusivity? Here are some of the women in product management you should be following. \nGroups Driving Inclusive Policies and Practices\nSeveral groups are actively discussing advocating for equal representation in product management. \nThe nonprofit Women In Product, founded in 2016, has a mission to “equip women to thrive in product management careers at all levels.” Created to connect women in the product field while also advocating for a more diverse workplace, it has 27 chapters worldwide, more than 33,000 community members. It hosts 125+ annual events to increase access to resources for skill development and offer exposure to opportunities with allied organizations that are “driving innovation through inclusive policies and practices that encourage mobility for women in product.” The organization’s vision is to ensure that “all people in product have equitable opportunities to build rewarding careers and shape the products of the future.” \nDownload IMPACT ➜\nSimilarly, the Advancing Women In Product (AWIP) organization is dedicated to providing members with “the right skill sets and executive mentorship” that women need to accelerate careers in product management. It also has chapters around the world.\nGet inspired by these six fantastic product managers who also happen to be women.\nGoing Beyond Gender Diversity\nWe have to be careful not to view gender diversity as just another box to check. In the quest to achieve greater inclusivity, this can potentially become a pitfall. \nIn “Diversity in Product Management Needs to Go Beyond a Gender Agenda,” Amanda Ralph, co-founder of Product Women, urges product teams also to seek cognitive diversity:\n“Good product managers know what many in social sciences are now evidencing – that effective teams not only have diverse backgrounds and experiences but importantly, are cognitively diverse and inclusive. Actively including and seeking diverse perspectives and thinking (cognitive diversity) leads to better outcomes.”\nRalph adds, “We must have a culture which is not only inclusive but which also actively mobilizes and leverages the different perspectives that diversity invariably brings.”\nStriving for cognitive diversity in the workplace might sound like an overwhelming challenge. Thankfully, organizations like Inclusion Ventures help teams and companies develop strategies for decreasing bias and enhancing inclusion.\nLearn how to recognize and reduce cognitive bias as a product manager.\nMoving the needle towards greater inclusivity is a marathon. To make meaningful strides towards gender diversity, we first have to reckon with where things stand today. \nThe goal of any product team should be to build great products. Inclusivity can help shape this outcome. It attracts more voices, experience, and perspectives to your product team. And ultimately, the products you build and release into the world will be better for it. \n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/gender-diversity-better-products/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925744744,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Why It Is Essential to Put Customers First with a Customer-Led Product Strategy","text":"\n At its most basic level, a customer-led product strategy means that your customers are the top priority at all times.\nSounds pretty obvious, right? But creating a truly customer-centric business model means balancing a lot of different factors, not just customer service. All too often, customers are losing out to more influential stakeholder groups and other priorities.\nOne report found that 80 percent of customers said the experience a company provides is just as important as its products or services. Therefore, it makes total sense to look at the products you offer from the customers’ perspective.\nEnsuring your products and services bring joy to customers at every stage of their journey will help grow your business, helping it survive even in tough times.\nPutting Customers First\nAny time you launch a new idea, a new product, or a new system, ask yourself the following questions:\n#1 Who will this serve?\n#2 How will it benefit the people it serves?\n#3 What are the company’s goals for this product or service?\nBy asking – and answering – these questions, you can create something that people truly value.\nAnticipating the kind of products customers need and making sure they get them will lead to deeper brand loyalty and customer retention.\nBut first, you need to know exactly what the customer wants to deliver it. Making use of key customer insights and then implementing them is vitally important.\nFor example, if you discover that most customers want to receive their purchases in the fastest possible time, you could use retail inventory management software to speed things up.\nRemember that 81 percent of consumers are willing to increase their spend with an organization in return for a better experience!\nRead the Customer Interview Toolbox ➜\nLooking at the Data\nYou might think you’re pretty hot on knowing what your customers want, especially if you’ve been running a successful business for many years.\nHowever, here’s a sobering statistic: 80 percent of companies believe they are delivering a superior customer experience, but only 8 percent of customers agree! This proves that you shouldn’t claim to be customer-centric if your products and services don’t reflect that.\nDigital technology means there are now more avenues for observing customer behaviors and spotting crucial insights – and statistics suggest that insight-driven customer experiences help businesses retain 89 percent of their customers.\nBy blending data from customer surveys with qualitative and observational insights, you can build a detailed profile of your target users and see their needs.\nIt’s also helpful to note what your competitors are up to and look at non-competitors to get an idea of best practices. You don’t have to copy their approach, but you can tease out the best bits and blend them into the perfect strategy for you.\nCreating a partnership with a competitor can actually aid the customer journey in some cases. If you cannot offer a product or service that your customer really wants, put your rivalry to one side and team up with a company that can!\nMaking a Plan\nOnce you’ve taken a look at the improvements you could make, it’s time to produce your plan of action. This framework should always put the customer front and center while ensuring any changes are viable within your overall business model.\nProduct roadmaps are useful in planning and development and can be used to create alignment across the organization. Start with the product vision statement, then set out your goals and initiatives.\nThe customer-led product strategy must be ingrained at every level of your company, so all your employees need to understand who the product is aimed at, what its unique selling points are, and what the long-term goal should be. Having your customer service and marketing departments work together is a good way to boost the customer experience.\nHiring the right people, who truly believe in your vision, is crucial – as is keeping them up to date and motivated. Using video conferencing software can help maintain face-to-face contact with those in other sectors of the business.\nRoadmap Software is a Must-Have (Not a Nice to Have) ➜\nAdapting to Change\nThe digital environment has created a definite shift in customer behavior, meaning that customers become more discerning and impatient in the products and services they choose.\nThey now have higher expectations and more choice than ever before – so if you don’t meet their needs, they can just as easily go elsewhere. New technology might make it easier for you to communicate with customers, but it’s also easier for them to complain!\nOlder businesses, in particular, can struggle to adapt to the new pattern, compared to newer companies and start-ups with millennials at the helm. But it’s basically a case of “adapt or die.” Companies that consistently find innovative ways to develop and market their products will succeed in the long run.\nTapping into Technology\nOne prediction is that by 2021, there will be over 230 million digital shoppers in the United States.\nThe role of technology affords many opportunities to provide a superb customer experience and gain customer insights at all the different touchpoints.\nThe automation of customer service is one such element, and we’re seeing businesses introduce improvements like a call recording service to make life simpler for both customers and agents.\nMeanwhile, the rise of artificial intelligence can give extra insights into the customer experience using smart chatbots and analytics.\nTechnology will only increase in importance, but you should make sure it is always useful to the customer and helps rather than hinders their journey! For older customers and more traditional businesses, the latest tech may not necessarily be the best solution for booking appointments, where it has advantages and disadvantages.\nMaking it Personal\nA customer-led product strategy means learning which products appeal to customers and viewing them as much more than mere transactions. However, just offering them excellent products and an enjoyable, hassle-free experience isn’t enough.\nPersonalization is the real key, as it makes customers feel like they are genuinely valuable to the business. Finding ways to personalize both the product and the overall journey will boost customer retention – and a happy customer will share their positive experiences with others, thus enhancing your rating on product review sites.\nIt goes without saying that you should deliver a great omnichannel experience as standard. Still, it also helps to give customers personalized support as they browse and hopefully make a purchase. Customers appreciate little details, such as adding extra filters to narrow down browsing choices and save time.\nA customer-facing product roadmap can be used to let individual customers know what you’re up to and how you’re implementing their feedback, helping you to build a deeper relationship.\nYou can encourage employees to develop empathy for the customers by talking to new service users and regular visitors if a customer has decided to switch to a different company, try to find out why – and see if there’s a way to tempt them back in.\nWe’ve all been on customer calls where we’re asked for a feature that just does not align with our product strategy. It’s not a problem if one request is an outlier, but how should you handle recurring requests from your customers that don’t align with your product strategy? In this webinar, product management veterans will share real examples of feature requests that did not naturally fit with the company’s vision. Join us and learn: – How to communicate with your customers and development team – When to say “no” and when to make room on your product roadmap – How to get to the real essence of a customer’s problem.\nMaintaining Momentum\nA customer-led product strategy means you need to be proactive instead of reactive. Make sure you ask the necessary questions before the customer embarks on their experience, thereby keeping in control of the process.\nOnce a customer has been convinced to create an account, the onboarding system is crucial in executing your product strategy. You could keep them coming back by creating personalized messages or offering free trials or discounts on products you’ve learned that particular customer would like.\nThe importance of website maintenance cannot be overstated if you want customers to choose you over your competitors.

In 1985 Coca-Cola canceled New Coke because the product team didn’t confirm that Coca-Cola drinkers would accept a change to their favorite soft drink. Samsung had to recall its Note 7 smartphones because they were exploding. And Google Glass suffered from privacy concerns, bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\nThankfully, few product launches fail in such spectacular fashion as those examples.\nMore often than not, product launches simply fall flat with the market, and often lack true product-market fit. In my experience in working with product teams, one of the most common reasons for lackluster product launches is ineffective communication throughout the launch process. And I’m not talking about a lack of emails, Slack messages, or meetings. We can all agree that there usually is plenty of communication happening at any given time—especially in a remote work environment.\nIf it’s not a lack of words, what makes communication and organization ineffective during a product launch? More often than not, it’s a lack of listening and intent where cross-functional teams talk at each other rather than collaborating together to achieve an outcome.\nIs Your Product Launch Cross-Functional Team a Track and Field Team, or a Bobsled Team?\nRight now, many product folks are running launches like they’re a track and field team in the Olympics. Every department has a separate job; they’re a sprinter, a long jumper, or pole vaulter. The pole vaulter can’t tell the long jumper how to jump farther, and the sprinter is solely focused on their run, so they can’t even help another runner participating in hurdles. They’re all participating in separate events. And while they’re all contributing to the total medal count (Cue: USA chant!), the athletes aren’t actually working together.\nSo, while individual medals sound great, it doesn’t quite work out as well when it comes to product launches. And that’s because product launches are a team sport.\nWhat cross-functional teams should strive to be like in product launches is a bobsled team.\nIn this scenario, everyone is doing their job in sync with one another, and it directly impacts the shared outcome—a successful product launch. And there’s no better feeling than when everyone is doing their best. That’s how you get Cool Runnings!\nIf you’re ready for your next product launch to run as smooth as a bobsled on an Olympic ice track, the key is two-way communication. I’ll explain what I mean in this post when I say that product launch communication needs to be a two-way street. I’ll also give you a couple of suggestions for making it happen with your team.\nTransforming Your Product Launch Communication Into a Two-Way Street\nFirst, let me start by breaking down the difference between what I have deemed one-way and two-way street communication.\nOne-way communication is like building a baseball field in the middle of a cornfield in Kansas and expecting people to show up (are you tired of sports movie references yet?). Kevin Costner clearly made it work, but the odds of success in the real world are extremely low.\nIn this case, product folks tell other stakeholders what they are doing, why, and when. When the stakeholders get confused, the solution is to repeat the information. On Zoom meetings, in documents, and on a roadmap.\nThe one-way communication is often mistaken for alignment, but in reality, all you have done is pushed information and hope the right things happen.\nIn contrast, two-way street communication is about presenting your launch plans and asking for feedback. It relies on the product person understanding what the stakeholders are (or aren’t) excited about and what they will need to be able to do their jobs well. It’s also about making sure they understand what they need to do to do their jobs well. The most significant benefit of two-way communication is that everyone becomes invested in the outcome because they feel like a key part of the launch process rather than a passive player in the product person’s plan.\nTo drive home the difference between one-way and two-way street communication, we created this helpful comic:\nTwo-way communication ties back to the idea that product folks need to focus on building relationships with key stakeholders. And as Simon Sinek shared, “Strong relationships are based on trust and communication. But if there is no communication, there can be no trust.”\nSource: LinkedIn\nWhen you focus on two-way communication, you are instilling trust in stakeholders. You show this by welcoming and valuing their input in the launch prep process.\nWhat Two-Way Product Launch Communication Looks Like in Practice\nAchieving two-way communication in product launches takes a concerted effort—especially from the product person leading the charge.\n1. You’re speaking with product launch stakeholders early and often.\nCommunicating your product launch strategy is an iterative process requiring you to communicate with stakeholders at every step of the process. A lack of communication destroys any sense of alignment and cross-functional flow.\nYour product roadmap needs to communicate the product team’s strategic goals and top priorities as they relate to the business’s strategic goals. At the end of the day, what the product and development teams build is to serve the customer after all. Stakeholders may require you to provide them with status updates, while marketing may need information on how to appeal to your target audience.\nRoadmaps are great resources to communicate the status of initiatives and provide milestones that reflect your strategic goals. Two-way communication in product launches breaks down silos and can help mitigate any bottlenecks throughout the launch process.\n2. You’re making yourself available for stakeholder questions and proactively providing guidance throughout the launch-prep stage.\nAs the product professional driving the launch, you are the main point of contact and information for all company stakeholders. The key is to understand what your cross-functional team needs to be successful and use your interactions with them to help them navigate what is often a complicated and long process.\nIt’s important to not drive yourself crazy trying to assume you understand all of your stakeholders’ needs and concerns. The truth is, you are not a mind reader. But you can use your product experience to hone in on questions to ask your stakeholders, like:\nDo you understand the timeline of the product launch?\nIs your team prepared for the launch?\nWhat can the product team provide you to craft an effective marketing message?\nDo you feel the product addresses our customer’s concerns?\nDo you have any insights into how customers may react or any thoughts about the questions customers may ask?\nImplementing two-way communication allows you to clearly define to stakeholders the goals and objectives of your launch. You can achieve this by setting up 1:1 meetings with stakeholders from various departments.\n3. The conversation doesn’t end when the product is launched.\nA successful product launch doesn’t end once the product hits the market. Keeping an eye on how the market is responding to your product can embolden your team or reveal major gaps in the product launch process.\nYour team will recognize a successful product launch when end-users engage with your product or service. By providing marketing and sales with enough information, your end-user clearly understands the benefits of your product or service.\nAfter the launch, your team should continue engaging with your customers. Customer feedback can provide your team with product insights to assist your team in their product launch. The product launch process is an iterative process. With each launch comes new findings.\nGo for Gold with Your Next Product Launch\nProduct Launches and Olympic Bobsledding have one thing in common: both are exhilarating.\nA lack of listening and intent can derail your product launch. Clear communication allows stakeholders to fill in knowledge gaps or provide extra resources to streamline the launch process. Break down those communication silos with better communication.\nTwo-way communication and cross-functional alignment provide your team with the support to launch a successful product. A successful launch gives you the privilege to make the impossible, possible.\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/product-launch-communication/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925712245,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Why Product Strategy is More Often Reactive than Proactive","text":"\n Have you ever started working on a new product and felt overwhelmed with everything you could do? If so, chances are you were working without the benefit of a concrete product strategy.\nA sound product strategy helps with feeling overwhelmed because it\nHelps your product team see how your product contributes to your company’s goals.\nHelps you get the right items on your roadmap and keep the wrong items off it.\nGuides your product decisions.\nGiven that product strategy provides product teams with so much guidance, why does it seem like your product strategy is more reactive, and is that ok?\nProduct strategy in theory\nProduct strategy answers key questions about who your product serves, how it benefits them, and how the product contributes to your organization.\nIn theory, your product strategy focuses on planning for the future and should anticipate threats, challenges, and opportunities in your market. You’re also trying to avoid issues before they occur.\nYour product strategy should be a proactive one where you’re trying to get improved results and meet business objectives.\nProduct strategy in practice\nAccording to The 2023 State of Product Management Report, the most significant influence on product strategy (46%) is business goals and objectives. Those product managers are proactive and focus on the future to plot their product strategy.\nIt also means that more than half of product managers say their product strategy is based on something else. Consequently, the next two most significant drivers of product strategy are requests from executive leadership or sales (26%) and customer feedback (26%).\nThat means over half of the product managers are reacting to internal and external feedback instead of planning for the long term. Their product strategy is reactive.\nIt’s possible that company size seems to play a role in whether a product strategy is proactive or reactive.\nSmaller companies appear to have more reactive product strategies. 36% of companies with under 20 employees say that customer feedback drives their product strategy. That could be because of the outsized influence that even one customer can have on a small business.\nAs organizations grow, their business goals and objectives have more of an influence on strategies. Enterprise companies (those with over 10,000 employees) were the most likely to say that business goals drive their product strategy.\nSo does that mean that enterprise companies have “better” product strategies than smaller companies? Not necessarily.\nDownload The Product Strategy Playbook ➜\nProduct strategy is both reactive and proactive\nIt turns out that your product strategy can be both reactive and proactive. Both types of strategies require research into your market, your customers, and your competitors. The difference comes in what you do with that information.\nProactive product strategy\nA proactive product strategy anticipates future market changes and customer needs before they happen.\nA proactive strategy requires assessing the information you get from your analysis of the market, your customers, and your competitors to identify new opportunities. You then gauge those opportunities against your business objectives to see which ones are the best fit for your business strategy.\nProactive product strategies typically lead to products that provide new solutions to an existing problem or solve a problem for which there previously wasn’t a suitable solution.\nA familiar example of a proactive product strategy is Apple’s iTunes Store. When Apple introduced iTunes in 2003, it “fundamentally challenged how customers accessed music,” said Andrew B, a Senior Product Manager for deep tech and sustainability. “With an exceptional user experience, and the iPod creating a further demand for the marketplace, they created a new ecosystem with incredible moats.”\nMarcin Stoll, Chief Product Officer at Tidio, notes, “to be proactive in Product, do your research well in advance, anticipate the market’s needs as much as possible, develop a detailed product roadmap, and monitor the competition. Investing in UX and UI research and Research & Development is something you cannot overlook if you want to be proactive in your strategy. Rather than putting out fires here and there, make sure they don’t occur.”\nAlok Agrawal, VP of Products at Mailmodo identifies three actions you can take to build a proactive product strategy:\n“One, have a long-term goal for the business to help guide the direction where the company is heading. Two, Create yearly or half-yearly milestones for the product team based on customer research and alignment with the business stakeholder. Three, Create a detailed product roadmap to drive weekly / biweekly priorities for the product team. ”\nReactive product strategy\nA reactive product strategy features adaptations to your product based on market and competitor analysis and customer feedback.\nYou let the feedback you receive from external sources and suggestions you receive from internal sources guide your product development efforts.\nReactive strategies are beneficial when new situations arise in your market, when one of your competitors introduces a new product, or to improve your product based on customer feedback. These strategies allow your company to adjust quickly to new situations, learn from your mistakes and take advantage of new trends.\nConsider the iTunes example from above. After Apple released iTunes, several other established companies created competing music sites (Google Play Music and Amazon Music). Moreover, new entries entered the market, like Spotify, and took advantage of the new trend.\nFor another example, consider the impact of the 2020 pandemic on remote meeting software. As people needed tools to meet remotely, companies like Microsoft and Google adjusted their product focus.\nAs more people returned to work, the companies that had built tools specifically for remote meetings, such as Zoom, have had to introduce capabilities beyond remote meetings to counter the falling demand and burnout on video meetings.\nMatthew Ramirez, Founder of Rephrasely, points out that product strategy “should be highly influenced by market conditions and customer feedback. Changes in the market or customer feedback can make a strategy that was successful yesterday obsolete today.”\nMarcin Stoll notes that market shifts, changes in customer demand, and unexpected competitor moves “make it harder for product teams to be proactive and make product predictions. Being reactive is not a bad thing: you listen to your customers’ feedback and adapt accordingly.”\nWhy you should mix proactive and reactive product strategies\nWhen you work on a completely new product, you may follow a proactive product strategy. You may even create an entirely new market or a novel new solution. You may also follow a reactive strategy and introduce a new product to improve upon products introduced by your competitors.\nEither way, once you receive feedback, your product strategy inherently becomes more reactive. Alok Agrawal explains two reasons for this shift:\n“1. You are validating hypotheses and doing quick iterations with customers to determine which customers to target and what problems to solve. Speed is critical at this point, and you need to change your product strategy in response to customer and market needs. 2. There are a lot of moving pieces on the GTM front, especially in terms of product pricing and business model, figuring out the right sales channel, etc., which directly impacts your product strategy.”\nRegardless of the type of strategy you employ, you need a steady stream of research and feedback. Andrew B suggests forming habits to ensure you get regular information flows, such as setting “recurring meetings in your calendar with customers” and using recurring competitor analysis to “reflect competitor insights within their product strategy.”\nDownload Our 2023 Product Management Report➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/reactive-product-strategy/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925717440,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Why Product Teams Keep Roadmaps and Processes Consistent","text":"\n Large organizations are all about operating at scale and leveraging the efficiencies this brings. But for enterprise product teams, the most common area where that opportunity and reality clash is roadmapping. While common processes and templates should be the lifeblood of any effective enterprise operation, 50% of large product teams (those with 50+ members) cite keeping roadmaps and processes consistent as their top growing pain.\nWhy is this such a problem? Why is the problem so important? And is there some solution to make this all easier? Let’s answer all these questions to help you identify ways to solve them.\nWhat’s wrong with a little inconsistency?\nProduct managers and leaders don’t get into this line of work to conform. Inspiration, insight, and new ideas rarely spawn from filling out lengthy forms or attending endless status meetings.\nCreativity and revelations instead arise from customer research, experiments, and data analysis. We try to break new ground instead of retreading well-worn paths. We continue to unveil new and better ways to satisfy and delight customers. And there’s ample room in the product lifecycle for these bespoke learning and discovery activities.\nBut when ideas and feedback begin flowing, they must get collected, characterized, prioritized, and scheduled. And here’s where leveraging standard tools, terminology, and processes begin kicking in when working in an enterprise setting.\nLarge organizations can’t function effectively if everyone takes a DIY approach to documenting and sharing this data. If Team A keeps their ideas on sticky notes while Team B throws them in a Google Sheet and Team C logs each one as a Jira entry, there’s no simple way to collaborate and share across the organization. Confusion and duplicative work will follow without common and shared knowledgebases and repositories.\nLearn how to transform your product launches from chaos to success➜\nThe importance of consistency in enterprises\nCrossfunctional work is relatively easy to do on the fly in a smaller organization. A common frame of reference exists and familiarity with the specific products, target market, buyer personas, etc. But that breaks down quickly as the organization grows, making ad hoc work more difficult to manage.\nFirst, you and your team’s reputation may not proceed you. You might lack credibility and trust with some folks, and they may not buy into your unique way of doing things, especially when it looks different from what they’re used to. But when an organization adopts consistent processes, documentation, and terminology, it’s far easier to plug-and-play different contributors and teams into various projects and roles.\nTeams may face a learning curve around the process and the project’s specifics. This common starting point facilitates far more flexible and fluid staffing arrangements. They can now reassign or reshuffle resources to meet organizational priorities and deadlines.\nStrategic alignment\nWhile this shared scaffolding makes it easy to optimize staffing, it also simplifies things for executive leadership and other stakeholders, getting them strategically aligned instead of critiquing the roadmap’s format or presentation.\nImagine you’re a senior executive seeing roadmaps for dozens of products, customer rollouts, and IT initiatives. Then imagine that every team that comes before you uses a completely different format and template for their roadmap. You now must first attempt deciphering what the legend, color coding, and timelines of each roadmap mean. It would be best to accomplish this before contemplating each one’s actual contents.\nAfter clearing that hurdle, you must now consider each roadmap in relation to the other. You’re comparing apples to oranges, trying to picture how they align and support the company’s overall mission. All that variation is distracting, confusing, and likely to result in oversights and confusion, which can plague implementation and damper enthusiasm for funding and staffing all of these seemingly unrelated initiatives.\nIt also makes it harder for senior leadership to paint a cohesive picture to the board, investors, key customers, and strategic partners. With no easy way to roll things up into a master view of the entire portfolio, they’re at a disadvantage when they do their jobs building support and positioning the overall business for success.\nFinding consistency with a purpose-built tool\nThe primary dilemma plaguing most enterprise organizations in this particular realm is a reliance on a wide variety of tools for roadmapping, but not necessarily multiple roadmapping tools. Instead, it’s a symptom of people getting creative and trying to build out roadmaps using the apps available, especially slide decks and spreadsheets, which are truly ill-suited for this purpose.\nIntroducing a tool specifically for roadmapping across the organization alleviates much confusion and minimizes variation across the enterprise. First, it gets everyone to work in the same digital environment, making it easier to collaborate and plug and play with resources from any department or division.\nEveryone will instantly have the capability of interpreting any roadmap and understanding its full context. This goes for product roadmaps and IT initiatives, and product launches.\nAdd a few best practices, ground rules, and templates, and enterprises can supercharge their synergies. With common color coding, legends, terminology, and timelines, different roadmaps now at least look similar. Teams can view them holistically for a broader view of what’s on tap for different teams and products.\nThis facilitates portfolio-level rollups and broader strategic alignment. Stakeholders know what to expect and understand what they’re looking at. Swimlanes break out how much work gets expended against different themes and goals, simplifying rebalancing efforts when needed. And resource planners can also make adjustments within individual roadmaps and across multiple ones quickly to optimize implementation and execution.\nStandardized roadmaps\nStandardized roadmaps also create more accountability and transparency. Using a common platform eliminated comparisons between different teams and their presentation styles, creating more focus on updates and progress.\nAnd for roadmaps shared externally with customers, prospects, or partners, a consistent platform and presentation format makes the enterprise look more organized and professional than each business unit or product team using a different template or medium for sharing their plans.\nLast but not least, roadmap standardization will save your organization time. No more endless formatting and re-formatting to make things look perfect for a high-level review or trying to pull random bits of data from disparate systems. Keeping in mind that the goal of building a roadmap is expediting building a great product, you want to spend less time futzing about the plan and more time building stuff and interacting with customers.\nIt’s never too late—or too early—to start\nA standardized, consistent approach to roadmaps and processes is an investment in the future of you, your team, your products, and your entire company. While standing up a new process requires its share of critical thinking, executive planning, socialization, and education, it will pay dividends in the future.\nBeginning as quickly as possible to define the ideal roadmap structure and format and then introducing a roadmapping tool that streamlines the process and captures the commonalities makes the most sense. The fewer legacy roadmap presentations and processes lingering, the better, and it can ingrain some best practices into the company’s DNA.\nBut not all product leaders have the luxury of a clean slate when operating within an enterprise setting. Plenty of bad habits might need breaking, and you probably must sentence some old traditions to the dustbin. Yet this exercise shouldn’t be in vain.\nThe sooner an enterprise can standardize how they plan for the future, the more time leadership will spend thinking strategically. They may even try to make sense of the materials presented. And with more bandwidth to spend on planning rather than formatting, product teams should give those leaders better roadmaps.\nNo matter where your organization sits in its journey toward consistent roadmapping processes, now is the time to get everyone on the same page and platform. The longer you wait only increases the degree of difficulty in this transition. Begin realizing the true economies of scale that standardizing on a common roadmapping tool can bring, and get started today with a free trial of ProductPlan.\nDownload Our 2023 Product Management Report➜\n ","url":"https://www.productplan.com/blog/roadmap-processes-consistent/"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1710925729540,"host":"www.productplan.com","page_title":"Your Product Team’s Communication is Making or Breaking Your Product","text":"\n Effective product team communication is not about talking to your team more often or providing them with more granular tasks. You want to make sure your team understands why what they’re doing matters.\nAs a product manager, you need to create an atmosphere that keeps the lines of communication open. Not just from you to your team, but from them to you, and to each other. You also want to communicate not only your tactical requirements but the strategy and vision for the product.\nWhy Poor Product Team Communication Can Kill Your Product\nIndustry surveys reveal that product managers view communication skills as the most important.\nIn our most recent annual survey—The 2021 State of Product Management Report—we found that product professionals rate communication #2 on the list of skills they believe their coworkers lack most.\nAnd don’t assume this means product managers let themselves off the hook when it comes to their communication abilities. More than half of our 2021 survey respondents admitted they have room to improve. The improvement came in their process of articulating strategy to their product team.\nWhat is this data telling us? Product professionals understand that clear, effective, and frequent communication among their team can affect whether a product succeeds or fails in the market.\nBut what does that mean? Simply stating the abstract phrase, “We need to improve product team communication,” doesn’t illustrate the problem clearly. So, let’s talk specifics.\nWhen your product team is not communicating effectively that miscommunication can derail your product.\n1. Your development team might take away the wrong success criteria.\nYou can generate what feels like consensus in a meeting with your cross-functional team. Everyone on the team might nod their heads as you say: “We want to create an intuitive, streamlined experience that solves the XYZ problem for our user persona. In actuality, everyone might have a different understanding of what to prioritize first. Moreover, this may affect how your team builds out the functionality.\n2. Your marketing team might develop the wrong messages for your user persona.\nYour marketing team might hear your goal to solve the XYZ problem, but do they know why it’s a problem worth solving? Do they know your target user or buyer—what that person needs, wants, fears?\nYou want your marketing coworkers to understand your product and customer so well that they feel enthusiastic as they develop your product’s marketing messages and campaigns.\nThat can’t happen if you don’t regularly communicate with your marketing team, show them the market data you’ve compiled, encourage them to sit in on your developers’ demos, etc.\nWithout that deeper understanding, your marketing team will parrot the terms and phrases you’ve given them. That’s no way to unlock their expertise and develop the most compelling messages possible.\n3. Your sales team might focus on benefits that don’t resonate with prospects.\nYou can hand your sales department a bunch of collateral when the product is ready for launch: demo videos, slideshows, sales sheets, prospect emails.\nBut will that be enough to turn your reps into an army of enthusiastic, knowledgeable advocates for the product? Almost certainly not.\nIf you want your sales team to have a deep understanding of the product they’re offering—and the customer they’re offering it to—you need to give them enough of a sense of your product’s value that they become evangelists for it.\n4. You might not hear that your development team isn’t equipped to realize your vision.\nRemember, product team communication needs to go in every direction. That means you need to be listening to your coworkers and hearing what they’re telling you.\nIf you’re not willing or able to do this, you could build your entire plan around a development team trying to let you know they don’t have the resources, skillset, budget, or understanding to deliver what you want.\nThe team might not want to disappoint you, so they offer noncommittal responses to your feature requests and timeline. And if you’re not truly listening, you might miss those signals.\nFor these reasons—and a thousand more like them—you need to prioritize clear and open communication among your product team. Now let me give you a few tips for incorporating this strategy into your process.\nGet Strategic Project Alignment ➜\n5 Ways a Great Product Manager Creates Effective Product Team Communication\n1. Answering questions around priorities.\nAs you begin to translate your high-level product vision into a strategic action plan, you can expect to hear questions, concerns, and challenges from your cross-functional team. Your action plan will require work from them, of course, and they might have questions about what should come first.\nA great product manager is ready for these challenges with evidence, strategic reasoning, and, above all, patience.\nEvery question you hear from your cross-functional team consists of two parts—the spoken question and the unspoken “why” behind it.\nPro tip: Start your answer by providing the why behind the question and see if your team can get to your answer before you reveal it to them.\n2. Explaining the product story.\nWell-told stories are memorable and influential. That’s why we still remember fairy tales and parables we heard in childhood.\nA great product manager can turn the details of a product concept into a story that’s clear, engaging, and fun to hear. A compelling product story can make it easier for your team to communicate the product’s value to each other—because they remember the story.\nImagine: You’re trying to develop a financial app to let parents give teenagers an allowance and monitor their spending habits. Rather than start by telling your cross-functional team all about the product’s features or what types of coding the app will need, you can give everyone a brief story:\n“Charlie’s parents are done handing him cash every week, asking him a few days later what he’s done with the money and hearing, ‘I forgot.’” Our app is going to put Charlie’s spending on the grid. We’re going to relieve mom and dad of the head-bashing frustration of trying to decide every week whether to send Charlie’s allowance into a black hole. We’re going to help these well-meaning parents give their son some independence… with limits.” \nEveryone on the team can now keep this memorable story as a reference while working on the product. If the product team gets stuck or confused, the team can ask themselves, “Is this going to help us help parents give their teenage kids independence and financial limits?”\n3. Listening to the team.\nGreat product managers don’t just talk. They listen.\nAs I noted above, listening means paying attention not only to what your team is saying but the implications behind it.\nIf your developers ask why you have prioritized an initiative, they ask because they don’t understand its strategic value? Or is it because they don’t think they can complete the project but are uncomfortable saying so? Is there a different reason altogether?\nWhen you receive questions or challenges from members of your team, you should not assume you’ve effectively resolved the issue just because you’ve answered. You also need to make sure your coworkers understand your reasoning and agree to whatever you’re asking of them.\nEvery person on your cross-functional team comes to their work from a unique perspective, with a fantastic set of skills and hopes, and challenges. They all have something valuable to contribute to your product’s success—even if it’s something you’d rather not hear, such as a warning about resource levels or your timeline. The only way to give your product the best chance of success is to listen to your team’s unique insights.\n4. Staying available and accessible.\nFortunately, we’re in the digital and mobile era. Staying accessible to your product team is easier than it’s ever been. You can set up Slack channels or an MS Teams environment to chat with your team anytime.\nGreat product managers make themselves approachable to their cross-functional team, and they respond to questions and requests with enthusiasm and a positive attitude.\nYou don’t need a 24-hour policy where you promise to answer any text within 15 minutes. But you do want to send your coworkers the signal that you welcome their feedback and questions throughout the product development process.\n5. Sharing a clear, up-to-date roadmap.\nFinally, a great product manager builds and shares a roadmap that answers the team’s strategic questions.\nFor a product manager, this means including, wherever possible, your strategic reasoning alongside every theme and epic you add to your roadmap. Suppose your sales team popped open your roadmap and saw that your next priority was to develop an Android version of your app. Could they also know the evidence for why you chose that as the product’s following significant enhancement?\nAs you can see from the above ProductPlan screenshot, you can quickly drop in a note about why you’ve decided to work on each item on the roadmap with our app.\nThis is another reason to use a purpose-built roadmap app instead of building out your product roadmap in a spreadsheet. All the extraordinary product managers are doing it these days.\nDownload the Product Roadmap Strategy Workbook➜\nBuilding a Team of Effective Product Managers (and a Path to Product Leadership)\nI hope you’ve found my reasoning for effective product team communication persuasive and that my suggestions can help you get there.
