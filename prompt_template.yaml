generate_file_structure:
  description: |
    Given a JSON file representing a directory structure, generate a text representation of the directory structure.
    
    The JSON file has the following structure:
     ```
    JSON_FILE:

    {JSON_FILE}
    ```

    Where `JSON_FILE` contains the directory structure data in JSON format, specifying the directories, subdirectories, and files.

    The text representation should follow this format:

    ```
    |__ directory1/
        |__ subdirectory1/
            |__ file1
            |__ file2
        |__ subdirectory2/
            |__ file3
    |__ directory2/
        |__ file4
        |__ file5
    ```

    Each directory and subdirectory should be represented by "|__", and files should be listed underneath their respective directories.

    Ensure that the generated text representation accurately reflects the directory structure specified in the JSON file.

    Ensure you include the "Files" in the root directory.

    RETURN ONLY THE TEXT REPRESENTATION, NO SCRIPTS, NO COMMENTS, NO EXPLANATIONS.
